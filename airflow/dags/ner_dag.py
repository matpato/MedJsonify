# This module defines an Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that runs       #
# Named Entity Recognition (NER) processing on preprocessed biomedical data.  #
# The DAG is scheduled to run monthly and focuses solely on the NER task,     #
# assuming preprocessing has been handled separately or previously.           #
#                                                                             #
