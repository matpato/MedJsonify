Increased bilirubin occurred in 12% of patients treated with ENSACOVE, including 2.3% Grade 3 and 0.2% Grade 4. There was one case of drug-induced liver injury in ENSACOVE-treated patients. The median time to first onset of increased ALT or AST was 5.3 weeks (range: 0.4 to 152 weeks). The dose of ENSACOVE was interrupted in 4.6% of patients for increased ALT or AST. Increased ALT or AST leading to dose reduction occurred in 2.6% and permanent discontinuation of ENSACOVE in 1.1% of patients. The dose of ENSACOVE was interrupted in 1.3% of patients for increased bilirubin. Increased bilirubin leading to dose reduction occurred in 0.7% and permanent discontinuation of ENSACOVE in 1.3% of patients. Monitor liver function tests including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin at baseline and every 2 weeks during the first cycle of treatment with ENSACOVE, and then monthly and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ENSACOVE based on the severity of the adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 5.3 Dermatologic Adverse Reactions ENSACOVE can cause dermatologic adverse reactions, including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), rash, pruritus, and photosensitivity. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )], dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 80% of patients receiving ENSACOVE, including Grade 3 in 14% of patients. Rash occurred in 72% of patients receiving ENSACOVE, including Grade 3 in 12% of patients. The median time to onset of rash was 9 days (range: 1 day to 17.3 months).

In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( photosensitivity occurred in 0.9% of patients receiving ENSACOVE; all were Grade 1. 6.1 ], ) Monitor patients for dermatologic adverse reactions during treatment with ENSACOVE. If dermatologic adverse reactions occur, treat with antihistamine, topical or systemic steroids based on the severity. Advise patients to limit direct sun exposure while taking ENSACOVE and for at least 1 week after discontinuation. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ENSACOVE based on the severity of the adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.4 Bradycardia ENSACOVE can cause symptomatic bradycardia. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )], bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 beats per minute) occurred in 6% of patients treated with ENSACOVE. All bradycardia events were Grade 1 or 2. Bradycardia requiring dose reduction occurred in 0.2% and led to dose interruption in 0.4% of ENSACOVE-treated patients. Monitor heart rate regularly during treatment with ENSACOVE. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ENSACOVE based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 5.5 Hyperglycemia ENSACOVE can cause hyperglycemia. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )], based on laboratory data, 44% of patients receiving ENSACOVE experienced increased blood glucose, including Grade 3 in 2.5%. The median time to onset of increased blood glucose was 5.9 weeks (0.4 weeks to 3.4 years). Assess fasting serum glucose at baseline and monitor serum glucose periodically during treatment with ENSACOVE. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ENSACOVE based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.6 Visual Disturbances ENSACOVE can cause visual disturbances including blurred vision, diplopia, photopsia, vitreous floaters, visual impairment, visual field defect, and reduced visual acuity. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )], 8% of patients receiving ENSACOVE experienced visual disturbance, including 0.2% Grade 3. Visual disturbances led to dose interruption in 0.4% of patients. Obtain an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with new or worsening visual symptoms during treatment with ENSACOVE. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ENSACOVE based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.7 Increased Creatine Phosphokinase In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )], of the 203 patients with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) laboratory data available, increased CPK occurred in 43% of patients who received ENSACOVE. The incidence of Grade 3 increased CPK was 1.5% and 0.5% were Grade 4. The median time to onset of increased CPK was 123 days (range: 13 days to 22 months). Increased CPK leading to dose interruption occurred in 0.2% and dose reduction in 0.4%. Advise patients to report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness. Monitor CPK levels during treatment with ENSACOVE. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ENSACOVE based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.8 Hyperuricemia ENSACOVE can cause hyperuricemia. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )], based on adverse reactions, 6% of patients experienced hyperuricemia, with 0.4% Grade 3 and 0.7% Grade 4. Nine patients (1.9%) required hydration and two patients (0.4%) required urate-lowering medication. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to initiating ENSACOVE and periodically during treatment. Initiate treatment with urate-lowering medications as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue ENSACOVE based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, ENSACOVE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In embryo-fetal developmental studies, oral administration of ensartinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including embryo-fetal mortality, alterations to growth, and structural abnormalities. Adverse embryo-fetal findings were seen at maternal exposures approximately equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended dose of 225 mg/day based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENSACOVE and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ENSACOVE and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. 5.10 FD&C Yellow No. 5 (Tartrazine) This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.",
