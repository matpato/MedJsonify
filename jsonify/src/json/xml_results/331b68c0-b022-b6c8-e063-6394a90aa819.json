    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Epistaxis, nasal ulceration, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, and impaired wound healing. Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma. ( 5.1 ) Glaucoma and cataracts: Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use fluticasone propionate nasal spray long-term. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, contact dermatitis, and rash) have been reported after administration of fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Discontinue fluticasone propionate nasal spray if such reactions occur. ( 5.3 ) Potential worsening of infections (e.g., existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection; ocular herpes simplex). Use with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients. ( 5.4 ) Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue fluticasone propionate nasal spray slowly. ( 5.5 ) Monitor growth of pediatric patients. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Local Nasal Effects Epistaxis : In clinical trials of 2 to 26 weeks’ duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo . [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] Nasal Ulceration : Postmarketing cases of nasal ulceration have been reported in patients treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray . [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Candida Infection : In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Nasal Septal Perforation : Postmarketing cases of nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray . [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Impaired Wound Healing : Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid using fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred. 5.2 Glaucoma and Cataracts Use of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use fluticasone propionate nasal spray long-term. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, contact dermatitis, and rash) have been reported after administration of fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Discontinue fluticasone propionate nasal spray if such reactions occur . Rarely, immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after the administration of fluticasone propionate nasal spray. [see Contraindications (4)] 5.4 Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the complete prescribing information for VZIG and IG.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Intranasal corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. 5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression When intranasal corticosteroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency. In addition, some patients may experience symptoms of corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression). Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, rapid decreases in systemic corticosteroid dosages may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. 5.6 Drug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir, nefazodone, voriconazole) with fluticasone propionate nasal spray is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur . [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] 5.7 Effect on Growth Intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving fluticasone propionate nasal spray. To minimize the systemic effects of intranasal corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate nasal spray, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. [see Dosage and Administration (2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: Epistaxis, nasal ulceration, Candida albicans infection, nasal septal perforation, and impaired wound healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Glaucoma and cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Effect on growth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] The most common adverse reactions (>3%) are headache, pharyngitis, epistaxis, nasal burning/nasal irritation, nausea/vomiting, asthma symptoms, and cough.

In controlled US clinical trials, more than 3,300 subjects with allergic and nonallergic rhinitis received treatment with intranasal fluticasone propionate. In general, adverse reactions in clinical trials have been primarily associated with irritation of the nasal mucous membranes, and the adverse reactions were reported with approximately the same frequency by subjects treated with placebo. Less than 2% of subjects in clinical trials discontinued because of adverse reactions; this rate was similar for vehicle placebo and active comparators. The safety data described below are based on 7 placebo-controlled clinical trials in subjects with allergic rhinitis. The 7 trials included 536 subjects (57 girls and 108 boys aged 4 to 11 years, 137 female and 234 male adolescents and adults) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray 200 mcg once daily over 2 to 4 weeks and 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials which included 246 subjects (119 female and 127 male adolescents and adults) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray 200 mcg once daily over 6 months (Table 1). Also included in Table 1 are adverse reactions from 2 trials in which 167 children (45 girls and 122 boys aged 4 to 11 years) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray 100 mcg once daily for 2 to 4 weeks. Table 1: Adverse Reactions with Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray with >3% Incidence and More Common than Placebo in Subjects ≥ 4 Years with Allergic Rhinitis Adverse Reaction Fluticasone Propionate 100 mcg Once Daily (N = 167) % Fluticasone Propionate 200 mcg Once Daily (N = 782) % Placebo (N = 758) % Headache 6.6 16.1 14.6 Pharyngitis 6 7.8 7.2 Epistaxis 6 6.9 5.4 Nasal Burning/Nasal Irritation 2.4 3.2 2.6 Nausea/Vomiting 4.8 2.6 2 Asthma Symptoms 7.2 3.3 2.9 Cough 3.6 3.8 2.8 Other adverse reactions with fluticasone propionate nasal spray observed with an incidence less than or equal to 3% but greater than or equal to 1% and more common than with placebo included: blood in nasal mucus, runny nose, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, flu-like symptoms, aches and pains, dizziness, and bronchitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following adverse events have been identified during postapproval use of intranasal fluticasone propionate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to fluticasone propionate or a combination of these factors. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, skin rash, edema of the face and tongue, pruritus, urticaria, bronchospasm, wheezing, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions, which in rare instances were severe. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : Alteration or loss of sense of taste and/or smell and, rarely, nasal septal perforation, nasal ulcer, sore throat, throat irritation and dryness, cough, hoarseness, and voice changes. Eye Disorders : Dryness and irritation, conjunctivitis, blurred vision, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts. Cases of growth suppression have been reported for intranasal corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate nasal spray . [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]"
