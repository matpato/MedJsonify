    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pantoprazole sodium for injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis to the formulation or any substituted benzimidazole. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urticaria [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including pantoprazole sodium for injection, are contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products [see .

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy : In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium for injection does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. ( 5.1 ) Injection Site Reactions : Thrombophlebitis is associated with the administration of pantoprazole sodium for injection. Assess the patient and remove the catheter if clinically indicated. ( 5.2 ) Potential Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency : Consider zinc supplementation in patients who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously. ( 5.3 ) Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis : Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients. ( 5.4 ) Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk. ( 5.5 ) Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. ( 5.6 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.7 ) Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue treatment and refer to specialist for evaluation. ( 5.8 ) Hepatic Effects : Elevations of transaminases observed. ( 5.9 ) Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism : Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( 5.10 ) Fundic Gland Polyps : Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium for injection does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Injection Site Reactions Thrombophlebitis was associated with the administration of pantoprazole sodium for injection. Assess the patient and remove the catheter if clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Exacerbation of Zinc Deficiency Pantoprazole sodium for injection contains edetate disodium (the salt form of EDTA), a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Therefore, zinc supplementation should be considered in patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection who are prone to zinc deficiency. Caution should be used when other EDTA containing products are also co-administered intravenously [see . Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] 5.4 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue pantoprazole sodium and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.5 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole sodium may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.6 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.4 ) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] 5.7 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of PPIs [see Discontinue pantoprazole sodium at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.8 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving pantoprazole sodium, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.9 Hepatic Effects Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered pantoprazole sodium is unknown [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.10 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of pantoprazole sodium and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI. 5.11 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.12 Interference with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop pantoprazole sodium treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . 5.13 Interference with Urine Screen for THC Pantoprazole sodium may produce false-positive urine screen for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.14 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole Sodium with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ].",

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative U.S. clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole sodium (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H 2 -receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another PPI, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 2. The number of patients treated in comparative studies with pantoprazole sodium for injection is limited; however, the adverse reactions seen were similar to those seen in the oral studies. Thrombophlebitis was the only new adverse reaction identified with pantoprazole sodium for injection.
