Famotidine Tablets are indicated in adults for the: treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions (e.g., Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasias). reduction of the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Famotidine is a histamine-2 (H 2 ) receptor antagonist indicated ( 1 ): In adult and pediatric patients 40 kg and greater for the treatment of: active duodenal ulcer (DU). active gastric ulcer. symptomatic nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). erosive esophagitis due to GERD, diagnosed by biopsy.

    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Famotidine tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to famotidine or other histamine-2 (H 2 ) receptor antagonists.

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions: Elderly patients and patients with renal impairment at increased risk; reduce the dosage. ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 8.5 , 8.6 ) GI Malignancy: Absence of GI symptoms does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy; evaluate prior to initiating therapy. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions Central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions, including confusion, delirium, hallucinations, disorientation, agitation, seizures, and lethargy, have been reported in elderly patients and patients with moderate and severe renal impairment treated with famotidine. Since famotidine blood levels are higher in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function, dosage adjustments are recommended in patients with renal impairment [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.2 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with famotidine does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider evaluation for gastric malignancy in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with famotidine.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions are: headache, dizziness, constipation, and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC. at 1-844-221-7294 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Famotidine was studied in 7 U.S. and international placebo- and active-controlled trials in approximately 2,500 patients [ see ]. A total of 1,442 patients were treated with famotidine, including 302 treated with 40 mg twice daily, 456 treated with 20 mg twice daily, 461 treated with 40 mg once daily, and 396 treated with 20 mg once daily. The population was 17 to 91 years old, fairly well distributed between gender and race; however, the predominant race treated was Caucasian. Clinical Studies (14) The following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of famotidine-treated patients: headache, dizziness and constipation. The following other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials: Body as a Whole: fever, asthenia, fatigue Cardiovascular: palpitations Gastrointestinal: elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth Hematologic: thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: orbital edema, rash, conjunctival injection, bronchospasm Musculoskeletal: musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia Nervous System/Psychiatric: seizure, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, decreased libido, insomnia, somnolence Skin: pruritus, dry skin, flushing Special Senses: tinnitus, taste disorder Other: impotence 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of famotidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, AV block, prolonged QT interval Gastrointestinal: cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis Hematologic: agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, facial edema, urticaria Musculoskeletal: rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramps Nervous System/Psychiatric: confusion, agitation, paresthesia Respiratory: interstitial pneumonia Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome"
