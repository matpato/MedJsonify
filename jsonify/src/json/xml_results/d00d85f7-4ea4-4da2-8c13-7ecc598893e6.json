    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pentamidine Isethionate is indicated for the prevention of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) in high-risk, HIV-infected patients defined by one or both of the following criteria: i. a history of one or more episodes of PJP ii. a peripheral CD4+ (T4 helper/inducer) lymphocyte count less than or equal to 200/mm3. These indications are based on the results of an 18-month randomized, dose-response trial in high risk HIV-infected patients and on existing epidemiological data from natural history studies. The patient population of the controlled trial consisted of 408 patients, 237 of whom had a history of one or more episodes of PJP. The remaining patients without a history of PJP included 55 patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma and 116 patients with other AIDS diagnoses, ARC or asymptomatic HIV infection. Patients were randomly assigned to receive Pentamidine Isethionate via the Respirgard® II nebulizer at one of the following three doses: 30 mg every two weeks (n=135), 150 mg every two weeks (n=134) or 300 mg every four weeks (n=139). The results of the trial demonstrated a significant protective effect (p<0.01) against PJP with the 300 mg every four week dosage regimen compared to the 30 mg every two week dosage regimen. The 300 mg dose regimen reduced the risk of developing PJP by 50 to 70% compared to the 30 mg regimen. A total of 293 patients (72% of all patients) also received zidovudine at some time during the trial. The analysis of the data demonstrated the efficacy of the 300 mg dose even after adjusting for the effect of zidovudine. The results of the trial further demonstrate that the dose and frequency of dosing are important to the efficacy of Pentamidine Isethionate prophylaxis in that multiple analyses consistently demonstrated a trend toward greater efficacy with 300 mg every four weeks as compared to 150 mg every two weeks. No dose-response was observed for reduction in overall mortality; however, mortality from PJP was low in all three dosage groups.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Pentamidine Isethionate is contraindicated in patients with a history of an anaphylactic reaction to inhaled or parenteral pentamidine isethionate.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS The potential for development of acute PJP still exists in patients receiving Pentamidine Isethionate prophylaxis. Therefore, any patient with symptoms suggestive of the presence of a pulmonary infection, including but not limited to dyspnea, fever or cough, should receive a thorough medical evaluation and appropriate diagnostic tests for possible acute PJP as well as for other opportunistic and nonopportunistic pathogens. The use of Pentamidine Isethionate may alter the clinical and radiographic features of PJP and could result in an atypical presentation, including but not limited to mild disease or focal infection. Prior to initiating Pentamidine Isethionate prophylaxis, symptomatic patients should be evaluated appropriately to exclude the presence of PJP. The recommended dose of Pentamidine Isethionate for the prevention of PJP is insufficient to treat acute PJP.PRECAUTIONS IMPORTANT: DO NOT MIX THE Pentamidine Isethionate SOLUTION WITH ANY OTHER DRUGS. DO NOT USE THE RESPIRGARD® II NEBULIZER TO ADMINISTER A BRONCHODILATOR. ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pulmonary Inhalation of Pentamidine Isethionate may induce bronchospasm or cough. This has been noted particularly in some patients who have a history of smoking or asthma. In clinical trials, cough and bronchospasm were the most frequently reported adverse experiences associated with Pentamidine Isethionate administration (38% and 15%, respectively of patients receiving the 300 mg dose); however less than 1% of the doses were interrupted or terminated due to these effects. For the majority of patients, cough and bronchospasm were controlled by administration of an aerosolized bronchodilator (only 1% of patients withdrew from the study due to treatment-associated cough or bronchospasm). In patients who experience bronchospasm or cough, administration of an inhaled bronchodilator prior to giving each Pentamidine Isethionate dose may minimize recurrence of the symptoms. General The extent and consequence of pentamidine accumulation following chronic inhalation therapy are not known. As a result, patients receiving Pentamidine Isethionate should be closely monitored for the development of serious adverse reactions that have occurred in patients receiving parenteral pentamidine, including hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hepatic or renal dysfunction, ventricular tachycardia, pancreatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hyperkalemia and abnormal ST segment of ECG. Extrapulmonary infection with P. jiroveci has been reported infrequently. Most, but not all, of the cases have been reported in patients who have a history of PJP. The presence of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis should be considered when evaluating patients with unexplained signs and symptoms. Cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported in patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine. Pentamidine Isethionate should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of acute pancreatitis develop. Drug Interactions While specific studies on drug interactions with Pentamidine Isethionate have not been conducted, the majority of patients in clinical trials received concomitant medications, including zidovudine, with no reported interactions. Because the nephrotoxic effects may be additive, the concomitant or sequential use of Pentamidine Isethionate and other nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, cisplatin, foscarnet, or vancomycin should be closely monitored and avoided, if possible. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Literature reports indicate that pentamidine was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial ( S. typhimurium ) test and did not induce an increase in chromosomal aberrations in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell or in human lymphocytes in vitro . No studies have been conducted to determine effects of pentamidine isethionate on carcinogenicity or fertility. Pregnancy-Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well controlled studies of Pentamidine Isethionate in pregnant women. A literature report indicated that intravenously administered pentamidine in pregnant rats at 4 mg/kg/day was embryolethal; teratogenicity was not observed in this study. It is unknown whether pentamidine administered via the aerosolized route crosses the placenta at clinically significant concentrations. It is not known whether Pentamidine Isethionate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pentamidine Isethionate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Pentamidine Isethionate is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Pentamidine Isethionate, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, Pentamidine Isethionate should not be given to a nursing mother unless the potential benefits are judged to outweigh the unknown risks. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Pentamidine Isethionate in pediatric patients (birth to 16 years of age) have not been established.",
