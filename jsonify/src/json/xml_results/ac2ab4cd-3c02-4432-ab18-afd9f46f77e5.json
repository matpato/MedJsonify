    "indications": "INDICATIONS & USAGE Panretin ® gel is indicated for topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma. Panretin ® gel is not indicated when systemic anti-KS therapy is required (e.g., more than 10 new KS lesions in the prior month, symptomatic lymphedema, symptomatic pulmonary KS, or symptomatic visceral involvement). There is no experience to date using Panretin ® gel with systemic anti-KS treatment.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Panretin ® gel is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to retinoids or to any of the ingredients of the product.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Pregnancy: Panretin ® gel could cause fetal harm if significant absorption were to occur in a pregnant woman. 9- cis -Retinoic acid has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits and mice. An increased incidence of fused sternebrae and limb and craniofacial defects occurred in rabbits given oral doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day (about five times the estimated daily human topical dose on a mg/m 2 basis, assuming complete systemic absorption of 9- cis -retinoic acid, when Panretin ® gel is administered as a 60 g tube over 1 month in a 60 kg human) during the period of organogenesis. Limb and craniofacial defects also occurred in mice given a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg on day eleven of gestation (about 127 times the estimated daily human topical dose on a mg/m 2 basis). Oral 9- cis -retinoic acid was also embryocidal, as indicated by early resorptions and post-implantation loss when it was given during the period of organogenesis to rabbits at doses of 1.5 mg/kg/day (about 15 times the estimated daily human topical dose on a mg/m 2 basis) and to rats at doses of 5 mg/kg/day (about 25 times the estimated daily human topical dose on a mg/m 2 basis). Animal reproduction studies with topical 9- cis -retinoic acid have not been conducted. It is not known whether topical Panretin ® gel can modulate endogenous 9- cis -retinoic acid levels in a pregnant woman nor whether systemic exposure is increased by application to ulcerated lesions or by duration of treatment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If Panretin ® gel is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking it, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of child-bearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.PRECAUTIONS Panretin ® gel is indicated for topical treatment of Kaposi’s sarcoma. Patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma were less tolerant of topical Panretin ® gel; five of seven patients had 6 episodes of treatment-limiting toxicities—grade 3 dermal irritation—with Panretin ® gel (0.01% or 0.05%). Information for Patients Please see accompanying “Patient’s Instructions for Use\" Photosensitivity Retinoids as a class have been associated with photosensitivity. There were no reports of photosensitivity associated with the use of Panretin ® gel in the clinical studies. Nonetheless, because in vitro data indicate that 9- cis -retinoic acid may have a weak photosensitizing effect, patients should be advised to minimize exposure of treated areas to sunlight and sunlamps during the use of Panretin ® gel. Drug Interactions Patients who are applying Panretin ® gel should not concurrently use products that contain DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), a common component of insect repellent products. Animal toxicology studies showed increased DEET toxicity when DEET was included as part of the formulation. Although there was no clinical evidence in the vehicle-controlled studies of drug interactions with systemic antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, and azole antifungals, the effect of Panretin ® gel on the steady-state concentrations of these drugs is not known. No drug interaction data are available on concomitant administration of Panretin ® gel and systemic anti-KS agents. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions No interference with laboratory tests has been observed. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to assess the carcinogenic potential of 9- cis -retinoic acid have not been conducted. 9- cis -Retinoic acid was not mutagenic in vitro (bacterial assays, Chinese hamster ovary cell HGPRT mutation assay) and was not clastogenic in vitro (chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes) nor in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Pregnancy (see “ Warnings ” section) Nursing Mothers It is not known whether alitretinoin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions from Panretin ® gel in nursing infants, mothers should discontinue nursing prior to using the drug. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Inadequate information is available to assess safety and efficacy in patients age 65 years or older.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of Panretin ® gel has been assessed in clinical studies of 385 patients with AIDS-related KS. Adverse events associated with the use of Panretin ® gel in patients with AIDS-related KS occurred almost exclusively at the site of application. The dermal toxicity begins as erythema; with continued application of Panretin ® gel, erythema may increase and edema may develop. Dermal toxicity may become treatment-limiting, with intense erythema, edema, and vesiculation. Usually, however, adverse events are mild to moderate in severity; they led to withdrawal from the study in only 7% of the patients. Severe local (application site) skin adverse events occurred in about 10% of patients in the U.S. study (versus 0% in the vehicle control). Table 2 lists the adverse events that occurred at the application site with an incidence of at least 5% during the double-blind phase in the Panretin ® gel-treated group and in the vehicle control group in either of the two controlled studies. Adverse events were reported at other sites but generally were similar in the two groups.
