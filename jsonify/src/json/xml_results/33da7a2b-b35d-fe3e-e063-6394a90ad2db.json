    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Neuraceq is indicated for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the brain to estimate β-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other causes of cognitive decline. A negative Neuraceq scan indicates sparse to no amyloid neuritic plaques and is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition; a negative scan result reduces the likelihood that a patient’s cognitive impairment is due to AD. A positive Neuraceq scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD, but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as older people with normal cognition. Neuraceq is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations. Limitations of Use • A positive Neuraceq scan does not establish the diagnosis of AD or any other cognitive disorder. • Safety and effectiveness of Neuraceq have not been established for: o Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic conditions; o Monitoring responses to therapies.

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •     Image interpretation errors (especially false positives) have been observed ( 5.1 ). •     Neuraceq, like all radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient’s long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Risk for Image Misinterpretation and Other Errors Errors may occur in the Neuraceq estimation of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaque density during image interpretation [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Image interpretation should be performed independently of the patient’s clinical information. The use of clinical information in the interpretation of Neuraceq images has not been evaluated and may lead to errors. Errors may also occur in cases with severe brain atrophy that limits the ability to distinguish gray and white matter on the Neuraceq scan. Errors may also occur due to motion artifacts that result in image distortion. Neuraceq scan results are indicative of the presence of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaques only at the time of image acquisition and a negative scan result does not preclude the development of brain neuritic β-amyloid plaques in the future. 5.2 Radiation Risk Neuraceq, similar to other radiopharmaceuticals, contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure.  Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer.  Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions were: injection site reaction consisting of erythema (1.7 %), irritation (1.1 %), and pain (3.4%). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Life Molecular Imaging at 1-833-491-2524 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rate observed in clinical practice. The overall safety profile of Neuraceq is based on data from 1,090 administrations of Neuraceq to 872 subjects. No serious adverse reactions related to Neuraceq administration have been reported. The most frequently observed adverse drug reactions in subjects receiving Neuraceq were injection site reactions consisting of erythema, irritation and pain. All adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and of short duration. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (occurring in at least 1% of subjects) during Neuraceq clinical trials are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Adverse Reactions with a Frequency ≥1% Reported in Clinical Trials (n = 1,090 Administrations in 872 Subjects) Adverse drug reaction n (%) Injection / application site erythema 18 (1.7) Injection site irritation 12 (1.1) Injection site pain 37 (3.4)"
