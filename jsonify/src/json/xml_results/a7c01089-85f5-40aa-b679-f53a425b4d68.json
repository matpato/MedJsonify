    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Dexrazoxane for injection is indicated for reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m 2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin therapy to maintain tumor control. Do not use with the initiation of doxorubicin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Dexrazoxane for injection is a cytoprotective agent indicated for reducing the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy associated with doxorubicin administration in women with metastatic breast cancer who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m 2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin therapy to maintain tumor control. Do not use dexrazoxane for injection with doxorubicin initiation. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not use dexrazoxane with non-anthracycline chemotherapy regimens. Dexrazoxane should not be used with non-anthracycline chemotherapy regimens. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression: Dexrazoxane may increase the myelosuppresive effects of chemotherapeutic agents. Perform hematological monitoring. ( 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients of reproductive potential of the potential hazard to the fetus. ( 5.5 , 8.1 ) 5.1\tMyelosuppression Dexrazoxane may add to the myelosuppression caused by chemotherapeutic agents. Obtain a complete blood count prior to and during each course of therapy, and administer dexrazoxane and chemotherapy only when adequate hematologic parameters are met. 5.2\tConcomitant Chemotherapy Only use dexrazoxane in those patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m 2 and are continuing with doxorubicin therapy. Do not use with chemotherapy initiation as dexrazoxane may interfere with the antitumor activity of the chemotherapy regimen. In a trial conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with or without dexrazoxane starting with their first cycle of FAC therapy, patients who were randomized to receive dexrazoxane had a lower response rate (48% vs. 63%) and shorter time to progression than patients who were randomized to receive placebo. 5.3\tCardiac Toxicity Treatment with dexrazoxane does not completely eliminate the risk of anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity. Monitor cardiac function before and periodically during therapy to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In general, if test results indicate deterioration in cardiac function associated with doxorubicin, the benefit of continued therapy should be carefully evaluated against the risk of producing irreversible cardiac damage. 5.4\tSecondary Malignancies Secondary malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have been reported in studies of pediatric patients who have received dexrazoxane in combination with chemotherapy. Dexrazoxane is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Some adult patients who received dexrazoxane in combination with anti-cancer agents known to be carcinogenic have also developed secondary malignancies, including AML and MDS. Razoxane is the racemic mixture, of which dexrazoxane is the S(+)-enantiomer. Secondary malignancies (primarily acute myeloid leukemia) have been reported in patients treated chronically with oral razoxane. In these patients, the total cumulative dose of razoxane ranged from 26 to 480 grams and the duration of treatment was from 42 to 319 weeks. One case of T-cell lymphoma, one case of B-cell lymphoma, and six to eight cases of cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma have also been reported in patients treated with razoxane. Long-term administration of razoxane to rodents was associated with the development of malignancies [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.5\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Dexrazoxane can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Dexrazoxane administration during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits at doses significantly lower than the clinically recommended dose [see If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception during treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical studies, dexrazoxane was administered to patients also receiving chemotherapeutic agents for cancer. Pain on injection was observed more frequently in patients receiving dexrazoxane versus placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The adverse reaction profile described in this section was identified from randomized, placebo- controlled, double-blind studies in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received the combination of the FAC chemotherapy regimen with or without dexrazoxane. The dose of doxorubicin was 50 mg/m 2 in each of these trials. Treatment was administered every three weeks until disease progression or cardiac toxicity. Patients in clinical trials who received FAC with dexrazoxane experienced more severe leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia than patients receiving FAC without dexrazoxane [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Table 1 below lists the incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving FAC with either dexrazoxane or placebo in the breast cancer studies. Adverse experiences occurring during courses 1 through 6 are displayed for patients receiving dexrazoxane or placebo with FAC beginning with their first course of therapy (columns 1 and 3, respectively). Adverse experiences occurring at course 7 and beyond for patients who received placebo with FAC during the first six courses and who then received either dexrazoxane or placebo with FAC are also displayed (columns 2 and 4, respectively). The adverse reactions listed below in Table 1 demonstrate that the frequency of adverse reaction “Pain on Injection” has been greater for dexrazoxane arm, as compared to placebo.
