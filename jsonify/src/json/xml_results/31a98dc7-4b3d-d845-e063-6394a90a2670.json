    "indications": "1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE Natesto is indicated for replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired): testicular failure due to conditions such as cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, orchiectomy, Klinefelter's syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage from alcohol or heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone concentrations and gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH]) above the normal range. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired): gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. These men have low testosterone serum concentrations but have gonadotropins in the normal or low range. Limitations of use: Safety and efficacy of Natesto in men with \"age-related hypogonadism\" (also referred to as \"late-onset hypogonadism\") have not been established. Safety and efficacy of Natesto in males less than 18 years old have not been established [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Natesto is an androgen indicated for replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone: Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) ( 1 ) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) ( 1 ) Limitations of use: Safety and efficacy of Natesto in men with \"age-related hypogonadism\" have not been established ( 1 ).

    "contraindications": "4. CONTRAINDICATIONS Natesto is contraindicated in men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate [ see Warnings and Precaution ( 5.5 )]. Natesto is contraindicated in women who are or who may become pregnant, or who are breast- feeding. Natesto may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Natesto may cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants. Exposure of a fetus or nursing infant to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization. If a pregnant woman is exposed to Natesto, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. Men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected prostate cancer ( 4 , 5.5 ) Pregnant or breast-feeding women. Testosterone may cause fetal harm ( 4 , 8.1 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Nasal Adverse Reactions and Limited Long-Term Information on Nasal Safety: Instruct patients to report any nasal symptoms or signs ( 5.1 ) Not recommended for use in patients with chronic nasal conditions or alterations in nasal anatomy. ( 5.2 ) Venous Thromboembolism: VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. ( 5.4 ) Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer: Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. ( 5.5 ) Blood Pressure Increases: Testosterone can increase blood pressure, which can increase cardiovascular risk over time. Measure blood pressure periodically. Not recommended for use in men with uncontrolled hypertension ( 5.6 ) Abuse of Testosterone: Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. ( 5.7 ) Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis: Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia ( 5.9 ) Edema: Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. ( 5.11 ) Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. ( 5.13 ) Monitor prostate-specific antigen (PSA), hematocrit and lipid concentrations periodically. ( 5.5 , 5.3 , 5.14 ) 5.1 Nasal Adverse Reactions and Limited Long-Term Information on Nasal Safety Nasal adverse reactions, including nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, nasal discomfort and nasal scabbing, were reported in the clinical trial experience with Natesto. All nasal adverse reactions except one (a single case of upper respiratory infection) were reported as mild or moderate in severity; however, long-term clinical trial data on nasal safety is available in a limited number of subjects [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Patients should be instructed to report any nasal symptoms or signs to their health care professional. In that circumstance, health care professionals should determine whether further evaluation (e.g., otorhinolaryngology consultation) or discontinuation of Natesto is appropriate. 5.2 Use in Patients with Chronic Nasal Conditions and Alterations in Nasal Anatomy Due to lack of clinical data on the safety or efficacy, Natesto is not recommended for use in the following patients: History of nasal disorders; History of nasal or sinus surgery; History of nasal fracture within the previous 6 months or nasal fracture that caused a deviated anterior nasal septum; Mucosal inflammatory disorders (e.g, Sjogren's syndrome); and Sinus disease. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require discontinuation of Natesto. Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products such as Natesto. In the Testosterone Replacement therapy for Assessment of long-term Vascular Events and efficacy ResponSE in hypogonadal men (TRAVERSE) Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cardiovascular (CV) outcomes study, compared to placebo, topical testosterone gel was associated with a higher risk of VTE (1.7% vs 1.2%) which included DVT (0.6% vs 0.5%) and PE (0.9% vs 0.5%) [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for (DVT) and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with Natesto and initiate appropriate workup and management [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.5 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate patients 3 to 6 months after initiation of treatment and then in accordance with prostate cancer screening practices [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 Blood Pressure Increases Testosterone products, such as Natesto, can increase blood pressure. Blood pressure increases can increase cardiovascular (CV) risk over time. The CV risk associated with topical testosterone gel was evaluated in TRAVERSE, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, CV outcomes study in men with a history of CV disease or multiple CV risk factors. In TRAVERSE, topical testosterone gel increased mean systolic blood pressure by 1.8 mmHg from baseline. However, the incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI] and non-fatal stroke, were similar between treatment groups (7% for topical testosterone gel vs 7.3% for placebo) [See . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Monitor blood pressure periodically in men using Natesto, especially men with hypertension. Natesto is not recommended for use in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.7 Abuse of Testosterone and Monitoring of Serum Testosterone Concentrations Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range. However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events. 5.8 Not for Use in Women Due to lack of controlled studies in women and potential virilizing effects, Natesto is not indicated for use in women. 5.9 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including Natesto, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters, including sperm count. 5.10 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. Natesto is not known to cause these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue Natesto while the cause is evaluated. 5.11 Edema Androgens, including Natesto, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.12 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated with androgens, including Natesto, for hypogonadism .[see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.13 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity and chronic lung disease. 5.14 Lipid Changes Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy. Changes in serum lipid profile may require discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.15 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including Natesto, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.16 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including Natesto, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged; however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.",
    "adverseReactions": "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3%) are: PSA increased, headache, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, nasal discomfort, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, and nasal scab. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Acerus Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-833-698-3786 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Natesto was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, 90-day clinical study. Patients could continue treatment with Natesto in two, open-label extension periods for an additional 90 and 180 days, respectively. A total of 306 hypogonadal men with morning testosterone concentrations ≤ 300 ng/dL received Natesto. Of these, 78 received Natesto at a dose of 11 mg three times daily. 90-Day Clinical Study Among the 78 patients who received Natesto three times daily in the 90-day clinical study, the most common adverse reactions were: prostate specific antigen (PSA) increased, headache, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, nasal discomfort, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection (URI), sinusitis, bronchitis and nasal scab. PSA increased was considered an adverse reaction by meeting one of two pre-specified criteria: (1) increase from baseline serum PSA greater than 1.4 ug/L, or (2) serum PSA greater than 4.0 ug/L. Table 1 shows adverse reactions reported by ≥3% of patients treated with 11 mg three times daily in the 90-day clinical study. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥3% of Patients Treated with Natesto (11 mg of testosterone) Three Times Daily in the 90-Day Clinical Study Adverse Reactions Natesto (11 mg of Testosterone) Three Times Daily (N=78) n (%) PSA increased 4 (5.1) Headache 3 (3.8) Rhinorrhea 3 (3.8) Epistaxis 3 (3.8) Nasal discomfort 3 (3.8) Nasopharyngitis 3 (3.8) Bronchitis 3 (3.8) Upper respiratory tract infection 3 (3.8) Sinusitis 3 (3.8) Nasal scab 3 (3.8) Adverse reactions reported by >2% but <3% of patients in the 90-day clinical study include: blood pressure increased, dysgeusia, nasal dryness, nasal congestion, and cough. Extension Periods Among the 78 patients who received Natesto three times daily in the 90-day clinical study, a total of 69 patients received Natesto three times daily in the first 90-day extension period. Among these 69 patients, the most common adverse reactions were: nasopharyngitis, PSA increased, parosmia, nasal discomfort, rhinorrhea and nasal scab. Table 2 shows adverse reactions reported by ≥3% of patients who received Natesto three times daily in both the 90-day clinical study and in the 90-day extension period. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥3% of Patients in Both the 90-Day Clinical Study and in the 90-Day Extension Period Adverse Reactions Natesto 11 mg TID (N=69) n (%) Nasopharyngitis 6 (8.7) Rhinorrhea 5 (7.2) PSA increased 4 (5.8) Parosmia 4 (5.8) Nasal discomfort 4 (5.8) Nasal Scab 4 (5.8) Upper respiratory tract infection 3 (4.3) Bronchitis 3 (4.3) Procedural pain 3 (4.3) Pain in extremity 3 (4.3) Headache 3 (4.3) Epistaxis 3 (4.3) A total of 18 patients received Natesto three times daily in all three treatment periods, including the 90-day clinical study, the first 90-day extension period, and the second 180-day extension period. Among these 18 patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in more than one patient each: nasopharyngitis, parosmia, PSA increased, nasal discomfort, nasal scab and hypertension. The following adverse reactions were reported in one patient each: nausea, nasal excoriation, thyroid stimulating hormone increased, decreased appetite, myalgia, anosmia, testicular atrophy, epistaxis, nasal septum disorder, nasal discomfort, and rhinorrhea. In patients who received Natesto three times daily, mean serum PSA concentrations increased by 0.2 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, and 0.2 ng/mL after 90, 180 and 360 days, respectively. Discontinuations due to Adverse Reactions Among all subjects (n=306) who received Natesto at any dose in the 90-day clinical study and its 90- and 180-day extension periods, a total of 6 subjects withdrew from treatment for the following adverse reactions, reported by 1 subject each: nasal discomfort, headache, dysgeusia, PSA increased, allergic reaction (hives, swollen lips and tongue), and 1 patient with myalgia, arthralgia, fever, chills and petechiae. Increased Hematocrit Among all subjects (n=306) who received Natesto at any dose in the 90-day clinical study and its 90- and 180-day extension periods, a total of 4 subjects had a hematocrit level > 55%. These 4 patients had baseline hematocrits of 48% and 51%. In no case did hematocrit exceed 58%. Nasal Adverse Reactions Among all subjects (n=306) who received Natesto at any dose in the 90-day clinical study and its 90- and 180-day extension periods, the following nasal adverse reactions were reported: nasopharyngitis (8.2%), rhinorrhea (7.8%), epistaxis (6.5%), nasal discomfort (5.9%), parosmia (5.2%), nasal scab (5.2%), upper respiratory infection (4.2%), nasal dryness (4.2%), and nasal congestion (3.9%). Cardiovascular Outcomes TRAVERSE was a randomized, double-blind, cardiovascular outcomes study to assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of topical testosterone gel compared to placebo in 5198 hypogonadal men aged 45 to 80 years with a history of CV disease or with multiple CV risk factors. The primary outcome was the incidence of the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), consisting of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke. The mean duration of therapy was approximately 22 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 33 months. Approximately 61% of all patients discontinued topical testosterone gel or placebo therapy. The mean patient age (±SD) was 63.3 (7.9) years. Approximately 80% of patients were White, 17% were Black, and 3% were of other races or ethnic groups. Approximately 69%, 84%, and 93% had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, respectively. Approximately 55% had preexisting cardiovascular disease. The mean serum testosterone concentration at baseline in patients receiving topical testosterone gel was 220.4 ng/dL (n=2129). The mean serum testosterone concentrations at 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, and 48 months in patients receiving topical testosterone gel were 440.5 ng/dL (n=1683), 420.9 ng/dl (n=1125), 428.7 ng/dL (n=731), and 365.2 ng/dL (n=220), respectively. For patients treated with topical testosterone gel, the incidence of MACE was 7.0% (n=182 events) and for those receiving placebo, the incidence of MACE was 7.3% (n=190 events). The study demonstrated non-inferiority of topical testosterone gel versus placebo because the upper bound of 95% CI was less than the pre-specified risk margin, of 1.5 for MACE (Hazard Ratio 0.96 [95% CI: 0.78, 1.17]). Additional Adverse Reactions Reported in TRAVERSE Additional adverse reactions reported in TRAVERSE at an incidence rate >2% in either treatment group and greater in topical testosterone gel versus placebo included: nonfatal arrythmias warranting intervention (5.2% vs 3.3%), atrial fibrillation (3.5% vs 2.4%), acute kidney injury (2.3% vs 1.5%) and bone fracture (3.5% vs 2.5%). For the adverse reaction of bone fracture, each event was adjudicated by clinical review. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. : myocardial infarction, stroke Cardiovascular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] : Venous thromboembolism Vascular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]"
