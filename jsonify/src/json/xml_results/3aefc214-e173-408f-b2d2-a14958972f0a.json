    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to upadacitinib or any of its excipients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Known hypersensitivity to upadacitinib or any of the excipients in RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. ( 4 , 5.6 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Infections : Avoid use in patients with active, serious infection, including localized infections. ( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity : Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported. Discontinue if a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs. ( 5.6 ) Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforations : Monitor patients at risk for GI perforations and promptly evaluate patients with symptoms. ( 5.7 ) Laboratory Abnormalities : Monitoring recommended due to potential changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes and lipids. ( 5.8 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : May cause fetal harm based on animal studies. Advise female patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.9 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) Vaccinations : Avoid use with live vaccines. ( 5.10 ) Medication Residue in Stool : Observed in stool or ostomy output in patients with shortened GI transit times.  Monitor patients clinically and consider alternative treatment if inadequate therapeutic response. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Serious and sometimes fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving RINVOQ. The most frequent serious infections reported with RINVOQ included pneumonia and cellulitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, oral/esophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcosis, were reported with RINVOQ. A higher rate of serious infections was observed with RINVOQ 30 mg compared to RINVOQ 15 mg. Avoid use of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection who have been exposed to tuberculosis with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. Interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, the patient should be closely monitored, and RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should be interrupted if the patient is not responding to antimicrobial therapy. RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ may be resumed once the infection is controlled. Tuberculosis Evaluate and test patients for latent and active tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to administration of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. Patients with latent TB should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should not be given to patients with active TB. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ in patients with previously untreated latent TB or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of TB is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-TB therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. During RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ use, monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy. Viral R eactivation Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster) and hepatitis B virus reactivation, were reported in clinical trials with RINVOQ [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The risk of herpes zoster appears to be higher in patients treated with RINVOQ in Japan. If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ until the episode resolves. Screening for viral hepatitis and monitoring for reactivation should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting and during therapy with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. Patients who were positive for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus RNA, were excluded from clinical trials. Patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis B virus DNA were excluded from clinical trials. However, cases of hepatitis B reactivation were still reported in patients enrolled in the Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ. If hepatitis B virus DNA is detected while receiving RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ, a liver specialist should be consulted. 5.2 Mortality In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ. 5. 3 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders Malignancies, including lymphomas, were observed in clinical trials of RINVOQ [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding NMSC) was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. In this study, current or past smokers had an additional increased risk of overall malignancies. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer NMSCs have been reported in patients treated with RINVOQ. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen. 5.4 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke was observed with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke. 5. 5 Thrombosis Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and arterial thrombosis, have occurred in patients treated for inflammatory conditions with JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, patients should discontinue RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ and be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis. 5. 6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioedema were reported in patients receiving RINVOQ in clinical trials. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . 5. 7 Gastrointestinal Perforations Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical trials with RINVOQ [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Monitor RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ-treated patients who may be at risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis and those taking concomitant medications including NSAIDs or corticosteroids). Evaluate promptly patients presenting with new onset abdominal pain for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation. 5.8 Laboratory Abnormalities Neutropenia Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (ANC less than 1000 cells/mm 3 ). Evaluate neutrophil counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation and interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e., ANC less than 1000 cells/mm 3 ) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.13 )] . Lymphopenia ALC less than 500 cells/mm 3 were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials. Evaluate lymphocyte counts at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm 3 ) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.13 )] . Anemia Decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 8 g/dL were reported in RINVOQ-treated patients in clinical trials. Evaluate hemoglobin at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Avoid RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ initiation or interrupt RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e., less than 8 g/dL) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.13 )] . Lipids Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Elevations in LDL cholesterol decreased to pre-treatment levels in response to statin therapy. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Assess lipid parameters approximately 12 weeks after initiation of treatment, and thereafter according to the clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia. Liver Enzyme Elevations Treatment with RINVOQ was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevations compared to treatment with placebo. Evaluate liver enzymes at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed during routine patient management and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ should be interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded. 5. 9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies, RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of upadacitinib to rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused increases in fetal malformations. Verify the pregnancy status of patients of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment.  Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ and for 4 weeks following completion of therapy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] . 5. 10 Vaccination s Avoid use of live vaccines during or immediately prior to RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ therapy initiation.  Prior to initiating RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ treatment, it is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic varicella zoster or herpes zoster vaccinations, in agreement with current immunization guidelines. 5.11 Medication Residue in Stool Reports of medication residue in stool or ostomy output have occurred in patients taking RINVOQ. Most reports described anatomic (e.g., ileostomy, colostomy, intestinal resection) or functional gastrointestinal conditions with shortened gastrointestinal transit times. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if medication residue is observed repeatedly.  Monitor patients clinically and consider alternative treatment if there is an inadequate therapeutic response.",

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis A total of 3833 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with RINVOQ 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg tablets once daily in the Phase 3 clinical trials of whom 2806 were exposed for at least one year. Patients could advance or switch to RINVOQ 15 mg from placebo, or be rescued to RINVOQ from active comparator or placebo from as early as Week 12 depending on the trial design. A total of 2630 patients received at least 1 dose of RINVOQ 15 mg, of whom 1860 were exposed for at least one year. In trials RA-I, RA-II, RA-III and RA-V, 1213 patients received at least 1 dose of RINVOQ 15 mg, of which 986 patients were exposed for at least one year, and 1203 patients received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib 30 mg, of which 946 were exposed for at least one year. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 1% of Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated with RINVOQ 15 mg in Placebo-controlled Trials Adverse Reaction Placebo RINVOQ 15 mg N = 1042 (%) N = 1035 (%) Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)* 9.5 13.5 Nausea 2.2 3.5 Cough 1.0 2.2 Pyrexia 0 1.2 *URTI includes: acute sinusitis, laryngitis, nasopharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, pharyngitis, pharyngotonsillitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, viral upper respiratory tract infection Other adverse reactions reported in less than 1% of patients in the RINVOQ 15 mg group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group through Week 12 included pneumonia, herpes zoster, herpes simplex (includes oral herpes), and oral candidiasis. Four integrated datasets are presented in the Specific Adverse Reaction section: Placebo-controlled Trials: Trials RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V were integrated to represent safety through 12/14 weeks for placebo (n=1042) and RINVOQ 15 mg (n=1035). Trials RA-III and RA-V were integrated to represent safety through 12 weeks for placebo (n=390), RINVOQ 15 mg (n=385), and upadacitinib 30 mg (n=384). Trial RA-IV did not include the 30 mg dose and, therefore, safety data for upadacitinib 30 mg can only be compared with placebo and RINVOQ 15 mg rates from pooling trials RA-III and RA-V. MTX-controlled Trials: Trials RA-I and RA-II were integrated to represent safety through 12/14 weeks for MTX (n=530), RINVOQ 15 mg (n=534), and upadacitinib 30 mg (n=529). 12-Month Exposure Dataset: Trials RA-I, II, III, and V were integrated to represent the long-term safety of RINVOQ 15 mg (n=1213) and upadacitinib 30 mg (n=1203). Exposure adjusted incidence rates were adjusted by trial for all the adverse events reported in this section. Specific Adverse Reactions Infections Placebo-controlled Trials: In RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V, infections were reported in 218 patients (95.7 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo and 284 patients (127.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg. In RA-III and RA-V, infections were reported in 99 patients (136.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 118 patients (164.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 126 patients (180.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with upadacitinib 30 mg. MTX-controlled Trials: Infections were reported in 127 patients (119.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with MTX monotherapy, 104 patients (91.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg monotherapy, and 128 patients (115.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with upadacitinib 30 mg monotherapy. 12-Month Exposure Dataset: Infections were reported in 615 patients (83.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and 674 patients (99.7 per 100 patient-years) treated with upadacitinib 30 mg.

Lipid Elevations Upadacitinib treatment was associated with dose-related increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Upadacitinib was also associated with increases in HDL cholesterol. Elevations in LDL and HDL cholesterol peaked by Week 8 and remained stable thereafter. In controlled trials, for up to 12/14 weeks, changes from baseline in lipid parameters in patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg, respectively, are summarized below: Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 14.81 mg/dL and 17.17 mg/dL. Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 8.16 mg/dL and 9.01 mg/dL. The mean LDL/HDL ratio remained stable. Mean triglycerides increased by 13.55 mg/dL and 14.44 mg/dL. Creatine Phosphokinase Elevations In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, dose-related increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values were observed. CPK elevations > 5 x ULN were reported in 1.0%, and 0.3% of patients over 12/14 weeks in the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Most elevations >5 x ULN were transient and did not require treatment discontinuation. In RA-III and RA-V, CPK elevations > 5 x ULN were observed in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, 1.6% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and none in patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg. Neutropenia In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, dose-related decreases in neutrophil counts, below 1000 cells/mm 3 in at least one measurement occurred in 1.1% and <0.1% of patients in the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups, respectively. In RA-III and RA-V, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1000 cells/mm 3 in at least one measurement occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, 1.3% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 2.4% of patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg.

Anemia In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs, for up to 12/14 weeks, hemoglobin decreases below 8 g/dL in at least one measurement occurred in <0.1% of patients in both the RINVOQ 15 mg and placebo groups. In RA-III and RA-V, hemoglobin decreases below 8 g/dL in at least one measurement were observed in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, and none in patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis A total of 1827 adult patients with psoriatic arthritis were treated with RINVOQ 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg tablets once daily in clinical trials, representing 1639.2 patient-years of exposure, of whom 722 were exposed to upadacitinib for at least one year. In the two Phase 3 trials, 907 patients received at least 1 dose of RINVOQ 15 mg, of whom 359 were exposed for at least one year. Two placebo-controlled trials were integrated (640 patients on RINVOQ 15 mg once daily and 635 patients on placebo) to evaluate the safety of RINVOQ 15 mg in comparison to placebo for up to 24 weeks after treatment initiation. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with RINVOQ 15 mg was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. During the 24-week placebo-controlled period, the frequencies of herpes zoster and herpes simplex were ≥1% (1.1% and 1.4%, respectively) with RINVOQ 15 mg and 0.8% and 1.3%, respectively with placebo. A higher incidence of acne and bronchitis was also observed in patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg (1.3% and 3.9%, respectively) compared to placebo (0.3% and 2.7%, respectively). Adverse Reactions in Patients with Atopic Dermatitis Three Phase 3 (AD-1, AD-2, and AD-3) and one Phase 2b (AD-4) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials evaluated the safety of RINVOQ in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The majority of patients were White (68%) and male (57%). The mean age was 34 years (ranged from 12 to 75 years) and 13% of the patients were 12 to less than 18 years. In these 4 trials, 2612 patients were treated with RINVOQ 15 mg tablets or 30 mg tablets orally once daily, with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS). In the Phase 3 clinical trials (AD-1, AD-2, and AD-3), a total of 1239 patients received RINVOQ 15 mg, of whom 791 were exposed for at least one year and 1246 patients received RINVOQ 30 mg, of whom 826 were exposed for at least one year. Trials AD-1, AD-2, and AD-4 compared the safety of RINVOQ monotherapy to placebo through Week 16. Trial AD-3 compared the safety of RINVOQ + TCS to placebo + TCS through Week 16. Weeks 0 to 16 (Trials AD-1 to AD-4) In RINVOQ trials with and without TCS (Trials AD-1, 2, 3 and 4) through Week 16, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions in the RINVOQ 15 mg, 30 mg and placebo groups were 2.3%, 2.9% and 3.8%, respectively. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in the RINVOQ 15 mg or 30 mg groups during the first 16 weeks of treatment.

The safety profile of RINVOQ through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 16. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with AD treated with RINVOQ was similar to the safety profile in patients with RA. Other specific adverse reactions that were reported in patients with AD included eczema herpeticum/Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption. Eczema Herpeticum/Kaposi’s Varicelliform Eruption Placebo-controlled Period (16 weeks): Eczema herpeticum was reported in 4 patients (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 6 patients (2.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and 7 patients (2.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 30 mg. 12-Month Exposure (Weeks 0 to 52): Eczema herpeticum was reported in 18 patients (1.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and 17 patients (1.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 30 mg. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Ulcerative Colitis RINVOQ was studied up to 8 weeks in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction studies (UC-1, UC-2) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose-finding study (UC-4; NCT02819635).  Long term safety up to 52-weeks was evaluated in patients who responded to induction therapy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance study (UC-3) and a long-term extension study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . In the two induction studies (UC-1, UC-2) and a dose finding study (UC-4), 1097 patients were enrolled of whom 719 patients received RINVOQ 45 mg tablets once daily. In the maintenance study (UC-3), 746 patients were enrolled of whom 250 patients received RINVOQ 15 mg tablets once daily and 251 patients received RINVOQ 30 mg tablets once daily. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients in any treatment arm in the induction and maintenance studies are shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.

The adverse reaction of non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 1% of patients in the RINVOQ 30 mg group and none of the patients in the RINVOQ 15 mg or placebo group through Week 52. The safety profile of RINVOQ in the long-term extension study was similar to the safety profile observed in the placebo-controlled induction and maintenance periods. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with RINVOQ was generally similar to the safety profile in patients with RA and AD. Specific Adverse Reactions Serious Infections Induction Studies: In UC-1, UC-2, and UC-4, serious infections were reported in 5 patients (8.4 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo and 9 patients (8.4 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 45 mg through 8 weeks. Placebo-controlled Maintenance Study: In UC-3, serious infections were reported in 8 patients (6.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 8 patients (4.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 6 patients (3.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 30 mg through 52 weeks. Laboratory Abnormalities Hepatic Transaminase Elevations In studies UC-1, UC-2, and UC-4, elevations of ALT to ≥ 3 x ULN in at least one measurement were observed in 1.5% of patients treated with RINVOQ 45 mg, and 0% of patients treated with placebo for 8 weeks. AST elevations to ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with RINVOQ 45 mg, and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo. Elevations of ALT to ≥ 5 x ULN occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with RINVOQ 45 mg and 0% of patients treated with placebo. In UC-3, elevations of ALT to ≥ 3 x ULN in at least one measurement were observed in 4% of patients treated with RINVOQ 30 mg, 2% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo for 52 weeks. Elevations of AST to ≥ 3 x ULN in at least one measurement were observed in 2% of patients treated with RINVOQ 30 mg, 1.6% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo. Elevations of ALT to ≥ 5 x ULN were observed in 0.8% of patients treated with 30 mg, 0.4% of patients treated with 15 mg, and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo. Overall, laboratory abnormalities observed in patients with ulcerative colitis treated with RINVOQ were similar to those described in patients with RA. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Crohn’s Disease RINVOQ was studied up to 12 weeks in patients with moderately to severely active CD in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled induction studies (CD-1, CD-2). Long term safety up to 52 weeks was evaluated in patients who responded to induction therapy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance study (CD-3), with additional data provided from a long-term extension (LTE) period [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . In the two induction studies (CD-1, CD-2), 1021 patients were enrolled, of whom 674 patients received RINVOQ 45 mg tablets once daily during the placebo-controlled period. In the maintenance study (CD-3), 673 patients were enrolled, of whom 221 patients received RINVOQ 15 mg tablets once daily and 229 patients received RINVOQ 30 mg tablets once daily during the randomized, placebo-controlled period. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with Crohn’s disease treated with RINVOQ was consistent with the known safety profile for RINVOQ in other indications. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with RINVOQ and at a higher rate than placebo in the induction and maintenance studies are shown in Tables 8 and 9, respectively.

The safety profile of RINVOQ in the long-term extension study was similar to the safety profile observed in the placebo-controlled induction and maintenance periods. Specific Adverse Reactions Serious Infections Induction Studies: In CD-1 and CD-2, serious infections were reported in 6 patients (8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo and 13 patients (9 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 45 mg through 12 weeks of the placebo-controlled period. Maintenance Study/LTE: In the long-term placebo-controlled period, serious infections were reported in 10 patients (7 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 7 patients (4 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 13 patients (6 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 30 mg. Gastrointestinal Perforations Induction Studies: During the induction studies in all patients treated with RINVOQ 45 mg (N=938), gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 4 patients (2 per 100 patient-years). In the placebo-controlled induction period, in CD-1 and CD-2, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in no patients treated with placebo (N=347) and 1 patient (1 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 45 mg (N=674) through 12 weeks. Maintenance Study/LTE: In the long-term placebo-controlled period, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 1 patient (1 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 1 patient (<1 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 15 mg, and 1 patient (<1 per 100 patient-years) treated with RINVOQ 30 mg. Patients who received placebo or RINVOQ 15 mg for maintenance therapy and lost response were treated with rescue RINVOQ 30 mg (N=336). Among these patients, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 3 patients (1 per 100 patient-years) through long-term treatment. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis A total of 596 patients with ankylosing spondylitis were treated with RINVOQ 15 mg tablets in the two clinical trials representing 577.3 patient-years of exposure, of whom 220 were exposed to RINVOQ 15 mg for at least one year. Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis treated with RINVOQ 15 mg was consistent with the safety profile observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. During the 14-week placebo-controlled period in Trial AS-I, the frequency of headache was 5.4% with RINVOQ 15 mg and 2.1% with placebo. During the 14-week placebo-controlled period in Trial AS-II, the frequency of headache was 3.3% with RINVOQ 15 mg and 1.4% with placebo.
