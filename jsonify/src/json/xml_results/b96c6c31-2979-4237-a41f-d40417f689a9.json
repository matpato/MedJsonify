    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE MYLOTARG is a CD33-directed antibody and cytotoxic drug conjugate indicated for: • treatment of newly-diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults and pediatric patients 1 month and older ( 1.1 ). • treatment of relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older ( 1.2 ). 1.1\tNewly-Diagnosed CD33-positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) MYLOTARG is indicated for the treatment of newly-diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in adults and pediatric patients 1 month and older. 1.2\tRelapsed or Refractory CD33-positive AML MYLOTARG is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in adults and pediatric patients 2 years and older.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS MYLOTARG is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the active substance in MYLOTARG or any of its components or to any of the excipients. Reactions have included anaphylaxis [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] Hypersensitivity to MYLOTARG or any of its components ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Infusion-related reactions (including anaphylaxis): Premedicate with a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and diphenhydramine. Monitor patients during and for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion. Interrupt the infusion, administer steroids or antihistamines, or permanently discontinue treatment as necessary ( 2.1 , 5.2 , 6 ). • Hemorrhage: Severe, including fatal, hemorrhage may occur when MYLOTARG is used at recommended doses. Monitor platelet counts frequently ( 5.3 , 6.1 ). • Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ). 5.1\tHepatotoxicity, Including Veno-occlusive Liver Disease (VOD) Hepatotoxicity, including life-threatening and sometimes fatal hepatic VOD events, have been reported in patients receiving MYLOTARG as a single agent or as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. In ALFA-0701, VOD events were reported in 6/131 (5%) adult patients during or following treatment with MYLOTARG, or following later hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The median time from the MYLOTARG dose to onset of VOD was 9 days (range: 2–298 days), with 5 events occurring within 28 days of any dose of MYLOTARG and 1 event occurring greater than 28 days after the last dose of MYLOTARG. Three of the 6 VOD events were fatal. VOD was also reported in 2 patients in the control arm of ALFA-0701 after receiving MYLOTARG as a therapy for relapsed AML. In MyloFrance-1 (MYLOTARG 3 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 4 and 7), VOD events were reported in none of the 57 patients during or following treatment, or following HSCT after completion of MYLOTARG treatment. In AAML0531, VOD events were reported in 25/520 (5%) pediatric patients in the MYLOTARG arm. VOD was fatal in 2 patients. Among 187 pediatric patients who underwent HSCT in the MYLOTARG arm, VOD occurred within 30 days post-HSCT in 20 (11%) patients. Based on an analysis across trials, the risk of VOD was higher in adult patients who received higher doses of MYLOTARG as monotherapy, in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment prior to receiving MYLOTARG, in patients treated with MYLOTARG after HSCT, and in patients who underwent HSCT after treatment with MYLOTARG. Patients who had moderate/severe hepatic impairment prior to treatment with MYLOTARG were 8.7 times more likely to develop VOD compared to patients without moderate/severe hepatic impairment at baseline. Patients treated with MYLOTARG for relapse after HSCT were 2.6 times more likely to develop VOD compared to patients without prior HSCT. Patients who underwent HSCT following MYLOTARG treatment were 2.9 times more likely to develop VOD after HSCT compared to patients without HSCT following MYLOTARG treatment. Although no relationship was found between VOD and time of HSCT relative to higher MYLOTARG monotherapy doses, the ALFA-0701 study recommended an interval of 2 months between the last dose of MYLOTARG and HSCT. In MyloFrance-1, no patients underwent HSCT within 3.5 months of MYLOTARG therapy. Assess ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase prior to each dose of MYLOTARG. After treatment with MYLOTARG, monitor frequently for signs and symptoms of VOD; these may include elevations in ALT, AST, total bilirubin, hepatomegaly (which may be painful), rapid weight gain, and ascites. Monitoring only total bilirubin may not identify all patients at risk of VOD. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests, more frequent monitoring of liver tests and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity is recommended. For patients who proceed to HSCT, monitor liver tests frequently during the post-HSCT period, as appropriate. Manage signs or symptoms of hepatic toxicity by dose interruption or discontinuation of MYLOTARG [see . In patients who experience VOD, discontinue MYLOTARG and treat according to standard medical practice. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.2\tInfusion-Related Reactions (Including Anaphylaxis) Life-threatening or fatal infusion-related-reactions can occur during or within 24 hours following infusion of MYLOTARG [see . Signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions may include fever, chills, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia and respiratory failure. Adverse Reactions (6) ] Premedicate prior to MYLOTARG infusion [see . Monitor vital signs frequently during infusion. Interrupt infusion immediately for patients who develop evidence of infusion reaction, especially dyspnea, bronchospasm, or hypotension. Monitor patients during and for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion or until signs and symptoms completely resolve. Discontinue use of MYLOTARG in patients who develop signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, including severe respiratory symptoms or clinically significant hypotension Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.3\tHemorrhage MYLOTARG is myelosuppressive and can cause fatal or life-threatening hemorrhage due to prolonged thrombocytopenia. In ALFA-0701, (MYLOTARG in combination with chemotherapy), all grades and Grade 3–4 bleeding events were reported in 118/131 (90%) and 27/131 (21%) patients, respectively. Fatal bleeding events (including cerebral hematoma, intracranial hematoma, and subdural hematoma) occurred in 4/131 (3%) patients. Thrombocytopenia with platelet counts less than 50 Gi/L persisting more than 42 days occurred in 19 (19%) patients in the induction phase [see . The proportion of patients with persistent thrombocytopenia increased with progressive treatment phases and was higher in patients treated with MYLOTARG plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone Adverse Reactions (6) ] [see . Adverse Reactions (6) ] In AAML0531, fatal bleeding occurred in 3/520 (<1%) of the pediatric patients. Grade 3 or 4 bleeding was reported in 66/520 (13%) of the pediatric patients in the MYLOTARG arm. In AML-19 (MYLOTARG monotherapy at 6 mg/m 2 Day 1 and 3 mg/m 2 Day 8), all grades and Grade 3 or higher bleeding were reported in 28/111 (25%) and 14/111 (13%) patients, respectively. Fatal bleeding occurred in 1/111 (1%). In MyloFrance-1 (MYLOTARG 3 mg/m 2 as monotherapy), Grade 3 bleeding was reported in 4/57 (7%) patients, but no patient experienced Grade 4 hemorrhage. Assess blood counts prior to each dose of MYLOTARG and monitor blood counts frequently after treatment with MYLOTARG until resolution of cytopenias. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding during treatment with MYLOTARG. Manage severe bleeding, hemorrhage or persistent thrombocytopenia using dose delay or permanent discontinuation of MYLOTARG [see , and provide supportive care per standard practice. Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.4\tQT Interval Prolongation QT interval prolongation has been observed in patients treated with other drugs containing calicheamicin. When administering MYLOTARG to patients who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, who are taking medicinal products that are known to prolong QT interval, and in patients with electrolyte disturbances, obtain electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes prior to the start of treatment and as needed during administration. 5.5\tUse in AML with Adverse-Risk Cytogenetics In subgroup analyses in ALFA-0701, the addition of MYLOTARG to standard combination chemotherapy did not improve event-free survival in the subgroup of patients having adverse-risk cytogenetics (HR 1.11; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.95). For patients being treated with MYLOTARG in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine for newly-diagnosed de novo AML, when cytogenetics testing results become available consider whether the potential benefit of continuing treatment with MYLOTARG outweighs the risks for the individual patient. 5.6\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, MYLOTARG can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, gemtuzumab ozogamicin caused embryo-fetal toxicity, starting at a dose that was approximately 0.4 times the exposure in patients at the maximum recommended dose, based on the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MYLOTARG and for at least 6 months after the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MYLOTARG and for at least 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Hepatotoxicity, including VOD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 15%) were hemorrhage, infection, fever, nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, increased AST, increased ALT, rash, mucositis, febrile neutropenia, and decreased appetite ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Combination Therapy in Newly-Diagnosed De Novo CD33-positive AML The safety of MYLOTARG in first-line combination therapy was evaluated in two prospective clinical trials, Study ALFA-0701 in adults and Study AAML0531 in pediatric patients. Study ALFA-0701 The safety evaluation of MYLOTARG (3 mg/m 2 Day 1, 4 and 7 in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine [DA]) in adults is based on data from ALFA-0701 for 131 patients treated with MYLOTARG plus DA and in 137 patients treated with DA alone [see In this study, 123 patients received all 3 fractionated doses of MYLOTARG and 7 patients missed at least 1 dose, with a mean total dose administered during induction of 14.51 mg (range: 4.6–18.0). MYLOTARG was received by 91 (70%) patients in the MYLOTARG arm during Consolidation 1 and 64 (49%) patients in the MYLOTARG arm during Consolidation 2. Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Safety data consisting of selected TEAEs considered most important for understanding the safety profile of MYLOTARG as well as all adverse events (AEs) that led to the permanent discontinuation of treatment were retrospectively collected. The selected TEAEs consisted of all grades hemorrhages, all grades VOD, and severe infections. Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 31% of patients in the MYLOTARG arm versus 7% in the DA arm. The most frequent (greater than or equal to 1%) adverse reactions for patients treated with MYLOTARG that led to permanent discontinuation were thrombocytopenia (15%), VOD (3%), and septic shock (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 8 patients (6%) in the MYLOTARG arm versus 3 patients (2%) in the DA arm. In the MYLOTARG arm, 3 patients died of VOD, 4 patients died of hemorrhage-related events (CNS hemorrhage, hemorrhagic shock), and 1 patient died of suspected cardiac cause. In the DA arm, 3 patients died of sepsis. Table 2.

In the MYLOTARG arm of this study, 520 patients received Induction 1 and 326 patients received Intensification 2. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Safety data collected included only Grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic adverse events, deaths, VOD/SOS, and prolongation of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Table 5 shows the Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥5%) in the MYLOTARG + chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone arms in patients with newly-diagnosed de novo AML in AAML0531. In the MYLOTARG + chemotherapy arm, fatal adverse reactions (by grouped terms) were infection (14 [3%]), multi-organ failure (5 [1%]), anemia (1 [<1%]), and hemorrhage (3 [<1%]). In the chemotherapy arm, fatal adverse reactions included infection (7 [1%]), multi-organ failure (6 [1%]), hepatic failure (1 [<1%]), hypotension (3 [<1%]), and hemorrhage (3 [<1%]). Table 5.

During Intensification 2, prolonged thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 Gi/L lasting past cycle Day 42 in the absence of active leukemia) was reported in 64% (190/297) of patients in the MYLOTARG + chemotherapy arm compared with 55% (146/264) in the chemotherapy alone arm. Prolonged neutropenia (neutrophils <0.5 Gi/L lasting past cycle Day 42 in the absence of active leukemia) occurred in 47% (142/300) versus 43% (118/275) of patients, respectively. The prolonged cytopenias were associated with more deaths in remission in the MYLOTARG + chemotherapy arm (29 [5%]) compared to the chemotherapy alone arm (15 [3%]). VOD events were reported in 25 (5%) patients in the MYLOTARG + chemotherapy arm as well as 25 (5%) of the chemotherapy alone arm. VOD was fatal in 2 (<1%) and 7 (1%) patients in the MYLOTARG + chemotherapy arm and chemotherapy alone arm, respectively. Monotherapy for Newly-Diagnosed CD33-positive AML The safety evaluation of MYLOTARG (6 mg/m 2 then 3 mg/m 2 , with 7 days between the doses) as monotherapy is based on a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial of MYLOTARG (N=118) versus best supportive care (BSC) (N=119) in patients with previously untreated AML who were considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy in Study AML-19 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The overall incidence of any Grade adverse reactions reported in AML-19 was 87% in the MYLOTARG arm and 90% in the BSC arm. The incidence of Grade greater than or equal to 3 adverse reactions was 61% in the MYLOTARG arm and 68% in the BSC arm. Death due to any Adverse Event was reported in the MYLOTARG arm of 19 (17%) compared to the BSC arm of 23 (20%). Table 6.

All 57 (100%) patients received the 3 planned doses of MYLOTARG. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] During the treatment period, Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that occurred in greater than 1% patients included sepsis (32%), fever (16%), rash (11%), pneumonia (7%), bleeding (7%), mucositis (4%), pain (4%), diarrhea (2%), headaches (2%), tachycardia (2%), and lung edema (2%). No Grade 4 toxicity was observed. All grade TEAEs that occurred in greater than 15% of patients included fever (79%), infection (42%), increased AST (40%), bleeding (23%), nausea and vomiting (21%), constipation (21%), mucositis (21%), headache (19%), increased ALT (16%), and rash (16%). No infectious deaths occurred. Grade 1 or 2 hyperbilirubinemia developed in 4 (7%) patients. No episodes of VOD occurred. Seven patients received HSCT after MYLOTARG treatment. Three patients received an allogeneic BMT and 4 patients were treated with autologous BMT. No patients developed VOD following HSCT. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MYLOTARG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Neutropenic colitis including fatal events Infections and Infestations: fungal lung infections including Pulmonary mycosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ; and bacterial infections including Stenotrophomonas infection Renal and Urinary Disorders: Hemorrhagic cystitis Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Interstitial pneumonia 6.3\tImmunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of MYLOTARG was not studied in clinical trials using the recommended dose regimens."
