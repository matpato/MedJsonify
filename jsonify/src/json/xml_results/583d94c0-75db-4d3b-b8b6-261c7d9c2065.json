    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Adults REVATIO is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (World Health Organization [WHO] Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] Pediatric Patients (1 to 17 Years old) REVATIO is indicated in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years old for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) to improve exercise ability and, in pediatric patients too young to perform standardized exercise testing, pulmonary hemodynamics thought to underlie improvements in exercise [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] Adults REVATIO is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (World Health Organization [WHO] Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening. ( 1 ) Pediatric Patients (1 to17 years old) REVATIO is indicated in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years old for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) to improve exercise ability and, in pediatric patients too young to perform standard exercise testing, pulmonary hemodynamics thought to underlie improvements in exercise ( 1 , 14 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS REVATIO is contraindicated in patients with: • Concomitant use of organic nitrates in any form, either regularly or intermittently, because of the greater risk of hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . • Concomitant use of riociguat, a guanylate cyclase stimulator. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, including sildenafil, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of riociguat. • Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or any component of the tablet, injection, or oral suspension. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reaction, has been reported in association with the use of sildenafil. • Use with organic nitrates or riociguat. ( 4 ) • History of hypersensitivity reaction to sildenafil or any component of the tablet, injection, or oral suspension. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Vasodilation effects may be more common in patients with hypotension or on antihypertensive therapy. ( 5.1 ) • Use in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) may cause pulmonary edema and is not recommended. ( 5.2 ) • Hearing or visual impairment: Seek medical attention if sudden decrease or loss of vision or hearing occurs. ( 5.4 , 5.5 ) • Pulmonary hypertension (PH) secondary to sickle cell disease: REVATIO may cause serious vaso-occlusive crises. ( 5.8 ) 5.1\tHypotension REVATIO has vasodilatory properties, resulting in mild and transient decreases in blood pressure. Before prescribing REVATIO, carefully consider whether patients with certain underlying conditions could be adversely affected by such vasodilatory effects (e.g., patients on antihypertensive therapy or with resting hypotension [blood pressure less than 90/50], fluid depletion, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction, or autonomic dysfunction). Monitor blood pressure when co‑administering blood pressure lowering drugs with REVATIO. 5.2\tWorsening Pulmonary Vascular Occlusive Disease Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno‑occlusive disease (PVOD). Since there are no clinical data on administration of REVATIO to patients with veno‑occlusive disease, administration of REVATIO to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when REVATIO is administered, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. 5.3 \tEpistaxis The incidence of epistaxis was 13% in patients taking REVATIO with PAH secondary to CTD. This effect was not seen in idiopathic PAH (REVATIO 3%, placebo 2%) patients. The incidence of epistaxis was also higher in REVATIO-treated patients with a concomitant oral vitamin K antagonist (9% versus 2% in those not treated with concomitant vitamin K antagonist). The safety of REVATIO is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders or active peptic ulceration. 5.4\tVisual Loss When used to treat erectile dysfunction, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, has been reported post marketing in temporal association with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors, including sildenafil. Most patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for developing NAION, including low cup to disc ratio (“crowded disc”). Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes while taking REVATIO. There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of REVATIO in patients with retinitis pigmentosa, a minority of whom have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases. Therefore, use of REVATIO in patients with retinitis pigmentosa is not recommended. 5.5 \tHearing Loss Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors, including REVATIO. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have played a role. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of REVATIO, to the patient’s underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors. Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing while taking PDE-5 inhibitors, including REVATIO. 5.6 \tCombination with Other PDE-5 inhibitors Sildenafil is also marketed as VIAGRA ® . The safety and efficacy of combinations of REVATIO with VIAGRA or other PDE‑5 inhibitors have not been studied. Inform patients taking REVATIO not to take VIAGRA or other PDE‑5 inhibitors. 5.7\tPriapism Use REVATIO with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (e.g., angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie’s disease) or in patients who have conditions, which may predispose them to priapism (e.g., sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia). In the event of an erection that persists longer than 4 hours, the patient should seek immediate medical assistance. If priapism (painful erection greater than 6 hours in duration) is not treated immediately, penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency could result. 5.8\tVaso-occlusive Crisis in Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension Secondary to Sickle Cell Disease In a small, prematurely terminated study of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) secondary to sickle cell disease, vaso‑occlusive crises requiring hospitalization were more commonly reported by patients who received REVATIO than by those randomized to placebo. The effectiveness and safety of REVATIO in the treatment of PH secondary to sickle cell disease has not been established.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse events are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: • Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Vision Loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Hearing Loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] • Vaso-occlusive Crisis in Patients with Pulmonary Hypertension Secondary to Sickle Cell Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Adults: Headache, dyspepsia, flushing, pain in limb, myalgia, back pain and diarrhea. ( 6.1 , 6.2 ) Children: Priapism. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Viatris at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical study and an open-label extension study (SUPER-1) in 277 REVATIO-treated adults with PAH (WHO Group I) [see the adverse reactions that were reported by at least 10% of REVATIO-treated patients in any dosing group, and were more frequent in REVATIO-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients are shown in Table 1. Adverse reactions were generally transient and mild to moderate in nature. The overall frequency of discontinuation in REVATIO-treated patients was 3% (20 mg and 40 mg three times a day) and 8% (80 mg three times a day). The overall frequency of discontinuation for placebo was 3%. Clinical Studies (14) ] Table 1. Most Common Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with REVATIO 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg and Placebo three times per day in SUPER-1 (More Frequent in REVATIO-Treated Patients than Placebo-Treated Patients) REVATIO 20 mg (n = 69) REVATIO 40 mg (n = 67) REVATIO 80 mg (n = 71) Placebo (n = 70) Headache 46% 42% 49% 39% Flushing 10% 9% 16% 4% Pain in Limb 7% 15% 9% 6% Myalgia 7% 6% 14% 4% Back Pain 13% 13% 9% 11% Dyspepsia 13% 8% 13% 7% Diarrhea 9% 12% 10% 6% In a placebo-controlled fixed dose titration study (PACES-1) of REVATIO (starting with recommended dose of 20 mg and increased to 40 mg and then 80 mg all three times a day) as an adjunct to intravenous epoprostenol in patients with PAH, no new safety issues were identified except for edema, which occurred in 25% of subjects in the combined REVATIO + epoprostenol group compared with 13% of subjects in the epoprostenol group [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] In a study to assess the effects of multiple doses of REVATIO on mortality in adults with PAH (StudyA1481324), the lower dose 5 mg TID group showed a higher observed number of deaths (all related to underlying disease/disease under study), serious adverse events, and severe adverse events than the 20 mg and 80 mg TID groups [see . Overall, the safety data for sildenafil 80 mg TID dose in Study A1481324 was consistent with the established safety profile of sildenafil in previous adult PAH studies. Clinical Studies (14) ] Pediatric Patients REVATIO was studied in a total of 234 PAH pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age in a 16‑week, double-blind placebo‑controlled study (STARTS-1); 220 patients continued in a long-term extension study (STARTS-2). Erection increased was observed in 9% of patients treated with sildenafil in STARTS-1. No other new adverse reactions were identified in pediatric patients [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] REVATIO Injection Adverse events with REVATIO injection were similar to those seen with oral tablets. 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sildenafil (marketed for both PAH and erectile dysfunction). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Events In postmarketing experience with sildenafil at doses indicated for erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, pulmonary hemorrhage, and subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages have been reported in temporal association with the use of the drug. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after use concurrent with sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient’s underlying cardiovascular disease, or to a combination of these or other factors.
