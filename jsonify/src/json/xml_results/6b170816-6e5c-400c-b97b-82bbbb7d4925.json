    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE • Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are an antimetabolite immunosuppressant indicated for prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients receiving kidney transplants and in pediatric patients at least 5 years of age and older who are at least 6 months post kidney transplant. ( 1.1 ) • Use in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. ( 1.1 ) Limitations of Use: • Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and mycophenolate mofetil tablets and capsules should not be used interchangeably. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection in Kidney Transplant Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients receiving a kidney transplant. Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in pediatric patients 5 years of age and older who are at least 6 months post kidney transplant. Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are to be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. 1.2 Limitations of Use Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) tablets and capsules should not be used interchangeably without physician supervision because the rate of absorption following the administration of these two products is not equivalent.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to mycophenolate sodium, mycophenolic acid ‎(MPA), mycophenolate mofetil, or to any of its excipients. ( 4.1 ) 4.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to mycophenolate sodium, mycophenolic acid (MPA), mycophenolate mofetil, or to any of its excipients. Reactions like rash, pruritus, hypotension, and chest pain have been observed in clinical trials and post marketing reports [see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • New or Reactivated Viral Infections: Consider reducing immunosuppression. ( 5.5 ) • Blood Dyscrasias, including Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA): Monitor for neutropenia or anemia; consider treatment interruption or dose reduction. ( 5.6 ) • Serious GI Tract Complications (gastrointestinal bleeding, perforations and ulcers): Administer with caution to patients with active digestive system disease. ( 5.7 ) • Immunizations: Avoid live attenuated vaccines. ( 5.9 ) • Patients with Hereditary Deficiency of Hypoxanthine-guanine Phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT): May cause exacerbation of disease symptoms; avoid use. ( 5.10 ) • Blood Donation: Avoid during therapy and for 6 weeks thereafter. ( 5.11 ) • Semen Donation: Avoid during therapy and for 90 days thereafter. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney, and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. 5.2 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should prescribe mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physicians responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient [see Boxed Warning ]. 5.3 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see Adverse Reactions ( ]. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. 6 ) As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. 5.4 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal outcomes. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection, combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution. 5.5 ) 5.5 New or Reactivated Viral Infections Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, reactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV), SARS-CoV-2 infection, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including MPA derivatives mycophenolic acid and MMF. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of new or reactivated viral infections. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease [see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6.1 ) Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended. 5.6 Blood Dyscrasias, Including Pure Red Cell Aplasia Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with MPA derivatives in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. The mechanism for MPA derivatives induced PRCA is unknown; the relative contribution of other immunosuppressants and their combinations in an immunosuppressive regimen is also unknown. In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of therapy with MPA derivatives. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk. Changes to mycophenolic acid therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients in order to minimize the risk of graft rejection. Patients receiving mycophenolic acid should be monitored for blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia). The development of neutropenia may be related to mycophenolic acid itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these reactions. Complete blood count should be performed weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and the third month of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If blood dyscrasias occur [neutropenia develops (ANC less than 1.3 × 10 3 /mcL) or anemia], dosing with mycophenolic acid should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate tests performed, and the patient managed accordingly. 5.7 Serious GI Tract Complications Gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospitalization), intestinal perforations, gastric ulcers, and duodenal ulcers have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolic acid. Mycophenolic acid should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease. 5.8 Acute Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with Mycophenolate Products Acute inflammatory syndrome (AIS) has been reported with the use of mycophenolate products, and some cases have resulted in hospitalization. AIS is a paradoxical pro-inflammatory reaction characterized by fever, arthralgias, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated inflammatory markers including, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, without evidence of infection or underlying disease recurrence. Symptoms occur within weeks to months of initiation of treatment or a dose increase. After discontinuation, improvement of symptoms and inflammatory markers are usually observed within 24 to 48 hours. Monitor patients for symptoms and laboratory parameters of AIS when starting treatment with mycophenolate products or when increasing the dosage. Discontinue treatment and consider other treatment alternatives based on the risk and benefit for the patient. 5.9 Immunizations During treatment with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Advise patients to discuss with the physician before seeking any immunizations. 5.10 Rare Hereditary Deficiencies Mycophenolic acid is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor (IMPDH inhibitor). Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT), such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout, such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, and renal disease, including renal failure. 5.11 Blood Donation Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets because their blood or blood products might be administered to a female of reproductive potential or a pregnant woman. 5.12 Semen Donation Based on animal data, men should not donate semen during therapy and for 90 days following discontinuation of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations ( ]. 8.3 )",

The data described below derive from two randomized, comparative, active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy trials in prevention of acute rejection in de novo and converted stable kidney transplant patients. In the de novo trial, patients were administered either mycophenolic acid 1.44 grams per day (N=213) or MMF 2 grams per day (N=210) within 48 hours post-transplant for 12 months in combination with cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED and corticosteroids. Forty-one percent of patients also received antibody therapy as induction treatment. In the conversion trial, renal transplant patients who were at least 6 months post-transplant and receiving 2 grams per day MMF in combination with cyclosporine USP MODIFIED, with or without corticosteroids for at least two weeks prior to entry in the trial were randomized to mycophenolic acid 1.44grams per day (N=159) or MMF 2 grams per day (N=163) for 12 months. The average age of patients in both studies was 47 years and 48 years ( de novo study and conversion study, respectively), ranging from 22 to 75 years. Approximately 66% of patients were male; 82% were white, 12% were black, and 6% other races. About 40% of patients were from the United States and 60% from other countries. In the de novo trial, the overall incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 18% (39/213) and 17% (35/210) in the mycophenolic acid and MMF arms, respectively. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the mycophenolic acid arm were graft loss (2%), diarrhea (2%), vomiting (1%), renal impairment (1%), CMV infection (1%), and leukopenia (1%). The overall incidence of patients reporting dose reduction at least once during the 0- to 12-month study period was 59% and 60% in the mycophenolic acid and MMF arms, respectively. The most frequent reasons for dose reduction in the mycophenolic acid arm were adverse reactions (44%), dose reductions according to protocol guidelines (17%), dosing errors (11%) and missing data (2%). The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) associated with the administration of mycophenolic acid were anemia, leukopenia, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, CMV infection, insomnia, and postoperative pain. The adverse reactions reported in ≥10% of patients in the de novo trial are presented in Table 2 below.

Interstitial lung disorders, including fatal pulmonary fibrosis. Respiratory: 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mycophenolic acid or other MPA derivatives. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: • Congenital malformations, including ear, facial, cardiac and nervous system malformations and an increased incidence of first trimester pregnancy loss have been reported following exposure to MMF during pregnancy [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.1 ) • Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( ] 5.4 , 5.5 ) ⁰ Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal. ⁰ Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. ⁰ Viral reactivation in patients infected with HBV or HCV. • Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with MPA derivatives in combination with other immunosuppressive agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.6 ) The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mycophenolic acid: agranulocytosis, asthenia, osteomyelitis, lymphadenopathy, lymphopenia, wheezing, dry mouth, gastritis, peritonitis, anorexia, alopecia, pulmonary edema, Kaposi’s sarcoma , de novo purine synthesis inhibitors-associated acute inflammatory syndrome."
