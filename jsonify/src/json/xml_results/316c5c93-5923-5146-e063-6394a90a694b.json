    "indications": "Medical and surgical infections caused by anaerobic bacteria sensitive to metronidazole in the treatment of infections, For prophylactic purposes in surgical procedures with a risk of anaerobic infection development, It is indicated in severe intestinal and hepatic amebiasis.",
    "contraindications": "Contraindicated in those with hypersensitivity to imidazole derivatives or excipients",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Long-term use of TURKFLEKS 0.5% METRONIDAZOL in treatment should be carefully evaluated (see section 5.3). In case of longer-than-planned use, regular blood tests should be performed, and leukocytes should be monitored in particular and attention should be paid to the development of neuropathy. Due to the risk of exacerbation of neurological symptoms, active or chronic peripheral or Should be used with caution in patients with central neurological disorders. Patients should be warned not to drink alcohol during treatment and for at least two days after stopping treatment, as it may cause a disulfiram-like reaction. It should be used with caution in patients with blood dyscrasia findings or history. Leukocyte count should be performed before and after treatment. In cases with blood dyscrasia or high dose and/or long-term treatment, the decision on whether to continue treatment should be made according to the severity of the infection. Adverse reactions should be monitored in treatments longer than 10 days. Metronidazole should be used with caution in cases of hepatic encephalopathy. The daily dose should be reduced to one third and used as a single dose. It may darken the urine color due to its metabolites; patients should be informed about this. • Oral, vaginal or intestinal candidiasis after intravenous metronidazole use may develop. It has no direct activity against aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. After Trichomonas vaginalis is eliminated, a gonococcal infection does not remain There is a possibility. In case of renal failure, the elimination half-life of metronidazole does not change. Therefore, there is no need to reduce the dose of metronidazole. However, metronidazole metabolites remain in these patients. The clinical significance of this is unknown. In patients receiving hemodialysis, metronidazole and its metabolites are effectively removed within an 8- hour dialysis period. Therefore, metronidazole should be re-administered immediately after hemodialysis. There is no routine dosage adjustment necessary in patients with renal failure receiving intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). If ataxia, vertigo, hallucinations or confusion are observed, treatment should be discontinued. Metronidazole potentiates the effect of vecuronium, which is used to create non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade. Although metronidazole has been found to be carcinogenic in a certain mouse species, this effect has not been demonstrated in rats and hamsters. The preparation has no such effect in humans. Due to insufficient evidence of mutagenicity risk in humans Use of TURKFLEKS 0.5% METRONIDAZOL for a longer period than usual should be carefully evaluated. This medicinal product contains 13 mmol sodium per 100 ml. Patients on a low sodium and low salt diet should be careful. It should also be administered with caution to those prone to oedema. Should be stored at room temperature below 25 °C.",
