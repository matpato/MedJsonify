    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Carisoprodol is indicated for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults. Limitation of Use Carisoprodol should only be used for short periods (up to two or three weeks) because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use has not been established and because acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions are generally of short duration. [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2) Carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant indicated for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults. (1) Limitations of Use Should only be used for acute treatment periods up to two or three weeks ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Carisoprodol is contraindicated in patients with a history of acute intermittent porphyria or a hypersensitivity reaction to a carbamate such as meprobamate. Acute intermittent porphyria (4) Hypersensitivity reactions to a carbamate such as meprobamate (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Due to sedative properties, may impair ability to perform hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery (5.1) Additive sedative effects when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol (5.1) Cases of abuse, dependence and withdrawal ( 5.2 , 9.2 , 9.3 ) Seizures (5.3) 5.1 Sedation Carisoprodol has sedative properties (in the low back pain trials, 13% to 17% of patients who received carisoprodol experienced sedation compared to 6% of patients who received placebo) [ see ] and may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. There have been post-marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of carisoprodol. ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1) Since the sedative effects of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive, appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. 5.2 Abuse, Dependence, and Withdrawal Carisoprodol, the active ingredient, has been subject to abuse, dependence, and withdrawal, misuse and criminal diversion. [ see ]. Abuse of carisoprodol poses a risk of overdosage which may lead to death, CNS and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures and other disorders [ Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.1 , 9.2 , 9.3) see ]. Overdosage (10) Post-marketing experience cases of carisoprodol abuse and dependence have been reported in patients with prolonged use and a history of drug abuse. Although most of these patients took other drugs of abuse, some patients solely abused carisoprodol. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation of carisoprodol after prolonged use. Reported withdrawal symptoms included insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis. One of carisoprodolâ€™s metabolites, meprobamate (a controlled substance), may also cause dependence [ see ]. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) To reduce the risk of carisoprodol abuse assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing. After prescribing, limit the length of treatment to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort, keep careful prescription records, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and educate patients and their families about abuse and on proper storage and disposal. 5.3 Seizures There have been post-marketing reports of seizures in patients who received carisoprodol. Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol) [ see ]. Overdosage (10)",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 2%) are drowsiness, dizziness, and headache (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oxford Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-844 508 1455 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. The data described below are based on 1387 patients pooled from two double blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo controlled, one-week trials in adult patients with acute, mechanical, lower back pain [ see ]. In these studies, patients were treated with 250 mg of carisoprodol, 350 mg of carisoprodol, or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days. The mean age was about 41 years old with 54% females and 46% males and 74 % Caucasian, 16 % Black, 9% Asian, and 2% other. Clinical Studies (14) There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in these two trials. In these two studies, 2.7%, 2%, and 5.4%, of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of carisoprodol, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to adverse events; and 0.5%, 0.5%, and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, 250 mg of carisoprodol, and 350 mg of carisoprodol, respectively, discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions. Table 1 displays adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with carisoprodol in the two trials described above. Table 1. Patients with Adverse Reactions in Controlled Studies Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=560) n (%) Carisoprodol 250 mg (n=548) n (%) Carisoprodol 350 mg (n=279) n (%) Drowsiness 31 (6) 73 (13) 47 (17) Dizziness 11 (2) 43 (8) 19 (7) Headache 11 (2) 26 (5) 9 (3) 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been reported during postapproval use of carisoprodol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, postural hypotension, and facial flushing [ see ]. Overdosage (10) Central Nervous System: Drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, tremor, agitation, irritability, headache, depressive reactions, syncope, insomnia, and seizures [ see ]. Overdosage (10) Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric discomfort. Hematologic: Leukopenia, pancytopenia"
