    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE WELIREG is a hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitor indicated: von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease for treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery. ( 1.1 ) Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) for treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clear cell component following a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI). ( 1.2 ) 1.1 von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease WELIREG is indicated for treatment of adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), not requiring immediate surgery. 1.2 Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) WELIREG is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with a clear cell component following a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI).",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anemia : Monitor for anemia before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment with WELIREG.( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Withhold WELIREG until hemoglobin ≥8g/dL, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue. For life threatening anemia, or for anemia requiring urgent intervention, withhold WELIREG until hemoglobin ≥8g/dL and resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue WELIREG. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Hypoxia : Monitor oxygen saturation before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with WELIREG. For hypoxia at rest, withhold until resolved, resume at reduced dose, or discontinue depending on severity. For life-threatening hypoxia, permanently discontinue WELIREG. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) 5.1 Anemia WELIREG can cause severe anemia that can require blood transfusion. Monitor for anemia before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with WELIREG. Transfuse patients as clinically indicated. For patients with hemoglobin <8g/dL, withhold WELIREG until ≥8g/dL, then resume at the same or reduced dose or permanently discontinue WELIREG, depending on the severity of anemia. For life threatening anemia or when urgent intervention is indicated, withhold WELIREG until hemoglobin ≥8g/dL, then resume at a reduced dose or permanently discontinue WELIREG [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease In LITESPARK-004, decreased hemoglobin occurred in 93% of patients and 7% had Grade 3 events [see . Median time to onset of anemia was 31 days (range: 1 day to 8.4 months). Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] The safety of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) for treatment of anemia in patients with VHL disease treated with WELIREG has not been established. Randomized controlled trials in patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with ESAs have shown that ESAs increased the risks of death and serious cardiovascular reactions, and decreased progression-free survival and/or overall survival. See the prescribing information for ESAs for more information. Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) In LITESPARK-005, decreased hemoglobin occurred in 88% of patients and 29% had Grade 3 events [see . Median time to onset of anemia was 29 days (range: 1 day to 16.6 months). Of the patients with anemia, 22% received transfusions only, 20% of patients received ESAs only and 12% received both transfusion and ESAs. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.2 Hypoxia WELIREG can cause severe hypoxia that may require discontinuation, supplemental oxygen, or hospitalization [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Monitor oxygen saturation before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with WELIREG. For decreased oxygen saturation with exercise (e.g., pulse oximeter <88% or P a O 2 ≤55 mm Hg), consider withholding WELIREG until pulse oximetry with exercise is greater than 88%, then resume at the same dose or at a reduced dose. For decreased oxygen saturation at rest (e.g., pulse oximeter <88% or PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg) or urgent intervention indicated, withhold WELIREG until resolved and resume at a reduced dose or discontinue. For life-threatening hypoxia or for recurrent symptomatic hypoxia, permanently discontinue WELIREG [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of hypoxia immediately to a healthcare provider. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease In LITESPARK- 004, hypoxia occurred in 1.6% of patients [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) In LITESPARK- 005, hypoxia occurred in 15% of patients and 10% had Grade 3 events [see . Of the patients with hypoxia, 69% were treated with oxygen therapy. Median time to onset of hypoxia was 30.5 days (range: 1 day to 21.1 months). Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals, WELIREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of belzutifan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal lethality, reduced fetal body weight, and fetal skeletal malformations at maternal exposures ≥0.2 times the human exposures (AUC) at the recommended dose of 120 mg daily. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose, since WELIREG can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with WELIREG and for 1 week after the last dose Drug Interactions (7.1) ].

    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypoxia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] VHL disease : Most common (≥25%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased hemoglobin, fatigue, increased creatinine, headache, dizziness, increased glucose, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) Advanced RCC : Most common (≥25%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities were decreased hemoglobin, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, increased creatinine, decreased lymphocytes, increased alanine aminotransferase, decreased sodium, increased potassium, and increased aspartate aminotransferase.

Patients received WELIREG 120 mg orally once daily. The median duration of exposure to WELIREG was 68 weeks (range: 8.4 to 104.7 weeks). Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Serious adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients who received WELIREG, including anemia, hypoxia, anaphylaxis reaction, retinal detachment, and central retinal vein occlusion (1 patient each). Permanent discontinuation of WELIREG due to adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of WELIREG were dizziness and opioid overdose (1.6% each). Dosage interruptions of WELIREG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in >2% of patients were fatigue, decreased hemoglobin, anemia, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, and influenza-like illness. Dose reductions of WELIREG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients. The most frequently reported adverse reaction which required dose reduction was fatigue (7%). The most common (≥25%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, that occurred in patients who received WELIREG were decreased hemoglobin, fatigue, increased creatinine, headache, dizziness, increased glucose, and nausea.
