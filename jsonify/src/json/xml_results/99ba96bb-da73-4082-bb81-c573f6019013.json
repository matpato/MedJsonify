When Pretomanid Tablets are administered in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, refer to the prescribing information for the respective drugs for a description of the adverse reactions associated with their use. Approximately 3100 subjects have been exposed to Pretomanid Tablets, either alone or as part of a combination therapy in clinical trials. The registrational trial, Trial 1 (NCT02333799), was a single-arm, open-label trial conducted in three sites in South Africa in which adult patients with pulmonary TB resistant to isoniazid, rifamycins, a fluoroquinolone and a second line injectable antibacterial drug or pulmonary TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, who were treatment-intolerant or non-responsive to standard therapy received the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid for 6 months (extendable to 9 months) with 24 months of follow-up. One hundred and nine patients were treated; 76% were black, and 23% were of mixed race.  Their ages ranged from 17 years to 60 years (mean 36 years), and all patients were from South Africa. Fifty-six (51%) patients were HIV-positive. There were 8 deaths. Six patients died while receiving treatment; all surviving patients, excluding one patient who withdrew consent, completed treatment. Two patients died during follow-up at Day 369 and Day 486, respectively. Trial 2 (NCT03086486) was a phase 3 partially-blinded, randomized trial assessing the safety and efficacy of various doses and treatment durations of linezolid in combination with Pretomanid Tablets plus bedaquiline in patients with pulmonary TB resistant to isoniazid, rifamycins, a fluoroquinolone and a second line injectable antibacterial drug, or pulmonary TB resistant to rifamycins and either a fluoroquinolone or a second line injectable antibacterial drug, or pulmonary TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin who were treatment intolerant or non-responsive to standard therapy. A total of 181 patients were randomized to one of the 4 treatment arms, Pretomanid Tablets plus bedaquiline plus either 1,200 mg or 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks or for 9 weeks (not an approved dosing regimen), followed by a linezolid placebo for 17 weeks. Males represented 67% of the patients in the trial and the median age of all patients was 36 years. 64% of patients were White and the remaining patients were Black (36%). The treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics. Most patients (93%) completed treatment. One patient died in the linezolid 1,200 mg for 9 weeks (not an approved dosing regimen) arm.

Except for one patient who died due to pneumonia and sepsis, all patients who experienced increased transaminases were able to continue therapy and complete the full course of treatment. In Trial 2, 47 of 181 patients (26%) had one or more liver-related adverse reactions, with similar numbers in each group. Myelosuppression is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. In Trial 1, the most common hematopoietic cytopenia was anemia (37%). The majority of cytopenias began after 2 weeks of treatment. Three patients experienced cytopenias that were considered serious: neutropenia in 1 patient and anemia in 2 patients. All 3 serious adverse reactions resulted in interruption of linezolid or all components of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid, and all resolved. In Trial 2, there was a greater incidence of myelosuppression, 29% versus 13%, for the 1,200 mg compared to the 600 mg linezolid 26-week group. Most of the myelosuppression-related adverse reactions were either grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. In the combined study data for Trial 1 and Trial 2, 2 patients reported serious adverse reactions of anemia with linezolid 1,200 mg, and none were reported in the 600 mg group. Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. In Trial 1, peripheral neuropathy was reported in 81% of patients. Most of these adverse reactions (64%) occurred after 8 weeks of treatment and resulted in dosing interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of linezolid. Severe, moderate, and mild peripheral neuropathy occurred in 22%, 32%, and 26% of patients, respectively. No adverse reaction related to peripheral neuropathy led to a discontinuation of the entire study regimen. In Trial 2, 17 (38%) patients reported an adverse reaction of peripheral neuropathy in the 1,200 mg 26-week treatment group; one of these reactions led to treatment discontinuation. In the 600 mg 26-week treatment group, 10 (22%) patients reported peripheral neuropathy, and none required linezolid treatment interruption or treatment discontinuation. Optic neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. Two patients (2%) in Trial 1 developed optic neuropathy after 16 weeks of treatment. Both were serious, confirmed on retinal examination as optic neuropathy/neuritis, and resulted in discontinuation of linezolid; both adverse reactions resolved. Overall, patients administered a linezolid dose of 600 mg twice daily had a similar safety profile to those administered a dose of 1,200 mg once daily. In Trial 2 overall, 4 (2%) patients reported an adverse reaction of optic neuropathy. All 4 patients were in the 1,200 mg linezolid 26-week treatment group (9%). The maximum severity was grade 1 (mild) for 1 patient, grade 2 (moderate) for 2 patients, and grade 3 (severe) for 1 patient. All patients had linezolid permanently discontinued except 1 patient who had already completed treatment when the adverse reaction occurred. Onset of optic neuropathy occurred after 3 months of treatment, and resolved."
