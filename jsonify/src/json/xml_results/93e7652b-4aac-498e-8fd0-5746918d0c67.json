    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions: (5.1) • Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis and hepatotoxicity, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, and immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction. • Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. • Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity and type of reaction. (2.3) • Infusion-related reactions: Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue OPDIVO based on severity of reaction. (5.2) • Complications of allogeneic HSCT: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. (5.3) • Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3) • Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. (5.5) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions OPDIVO is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD‑1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO depending on severity [see . In general, if OPDIVO requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which is defined as requiring use of steroids and no clear alternate etiology. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. OPDIVO as a Single Agent Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO as a single agent, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 1.1% and withholding of OPDIVO in 0.8% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (61/61) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 84% of the 61 patients.

Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 3.6% and withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 2.6% of patients with RCC or CRC. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (48/48) of patients with hepatitis. Approximately 19% of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis required addition of mycophenolic acid to high-dose corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 88% of the 48 patients. Of the 17 patients in whom OPDIVO with ipilimumab was withheld for hepatitis, 14 reinitiated treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 10 (71%) had recurrence of hepatitis. OPDIVO with Cabozantinib OPDIVO in combination with cabozantinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to OPDIVO alone. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt OPDIVO and cabozantinib and consider administering corticosteroids [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] With the combination of OPDIVO and cabozantinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT or AST were seen in 11% of patients [see . ALT or AST >3 times ULN (Grade ≥2) was reported in 83 patients, of whom 23 (28%) received systemic corticosteroids; ALT or AST resolved to Grades 0-1 in 74 (89%).

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received OPDIVO or OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab, or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barre syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy Ocular: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis, and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism Other (Hematologic/Immune): Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions OPDIVO can cause severe infusion-related reactions, which have been reported in <1% of patients in clinical trials. Discontinue OPDIVO in patients with severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion-related reactions [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] OPDIVO as a Single Agent In patients who received OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 6.4% (127/1994) of patients. In a trial assessing the pharmacokinetics and safety of a more rapid infusion, in which patients received OPDIVO as a 60-minute intravenous infusion or a 30-minute intravenous infusion, infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (8/368) and 2.7% (10/369) of patients, respectively. Additionally, 0.5% (2/368) and 1.4% (5/369) of patients, respectively, experienced adverse reactions within 48 hours of infusion that led to dose delay, permanent discontinuation, or withholding of OPDIVO. OPDIVO with Ipilimumab OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.5% (10/407) of patients with melanoma and in 8% (4/49) of patients with HCC who received OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Infusion-related reactions occurred in 5.1% (28/547) of patients with RCC and 4.2% (5/119) of patients with CRC who received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, respectively. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause) [see . These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for 5 months after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] 5.5 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of a PD-1 blocking antibody, including OPDIVO, to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.",

Permanent discontinuation of adjuvant OPDIVO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients; the most frequent (≥1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation of adjuvant OPDIVO were pneumonitis (4.2%) and diarrhea (1.4%). Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC: In Combination with Ipilimumab The safety of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-227, a randomized, multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label trial in patients with previously untreated metastatic or recurrent NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations [see . The trial excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 6 weeks or platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The median duration of therapy in OPDIVO and ipilimumab-treated patients was 4.2 months (range: 1 day to 25.5 months): 39% of patients received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for >6 months and 23% of patients received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for >1 year. The population characteristics were: median age 64 years (range: 26 to 87); 48% were ≥65 years of age, 76% White, and 67% male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%), 85% were former/current smokers, 11% had brain metastases, 28% had squamous histology and 72% had non-squamous histology. Clinical Studies (14.5) ] Serious adverse reactions occurred in 58% of patients. OPDIVO and ipilimumab were discontinued for adverse reactions in 24% of patients and 53% had at least one dose withheld for an adverse reaction. The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, diarrhea/colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypophysitis. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.7% of patients; these included events of pneumonitis (4 patients), myocarditis, acute kidney injury, shock, hyperglycemia, multi-system organ failure, and renal failure. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, rash, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea/colitis, dyspnea, cough, hepatitis, nausea, and pruritus.

The median duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range: 1 day to 29.6+ months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and 3.7 months (range: 6 days to 25.7+ months) in everolimus-treated patients. Clinical Studies (14.7) ] Rate of death on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose was 4.7% on the OPDIVO arm. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 47% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Study therapy was discontinued for adverse reactions in 16% of OPDIVO patients. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients receiving OPDIVO had a dose interruption for an adverse reaction. The most frequent serious adverse reactions in at least 2% of patients were: acute kidney injury, pleural effusion, pneumonia, diarrhea, and hypercalcemia. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) were fatigue, cough, nausea, rash, dyspnea, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, back pain, and arthralgia. The most common laboratory abnormalities which have worsened compared to baseline in ≥30% of patients include increased creatinine, lymphopenia, anemia, increased AST, increased alkaline phosphatase, hyponatremia, increased triglycerides, and hyperkalemia. In addition, among patients with TSH < ULN at baseline, a greater proportion of patients experienced a treatment-emergent elevation of TSH >ULN in the OPDIVO group compared to the everolimus group (26% and 14%, respectively). Tables 29 and 30 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in CHECKMATE-025.

Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression, maximal clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity. Clinical Studies (14.8) ] The median age was 34 years (range: 18 to 72), 98% of patients had received autologous HSCT, none had received allogeneic HSCT, and 74% had received brentuximab vedotin. The median number of prior systemic regimens was 4 (range: 2 to 15). Patients received a median of 23 doses (cycles) of OPDIVO (range: 1 to 48), with a median duration of therapy of 11 months (range: 0 to 23 months). Eleven patients died from causes other than disease progression: 3 from adverse reactions within 30 days of the last nivolumab dose, 2 from infection 8 to 9 months after completing nivolumab, and 6 from complications of allogeneic HSCT. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients. Dose delay for an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients. OPDIVO was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥1% of patients were pneumonia, infusion-related reaction, pyrexia, colitis or diarrhea, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, and rash. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) among all patients were upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, diarrhea, pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, rash, nausea, and pruritus.

Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (13/266) of patients receiving OPDIVO (one Grade 3 and 12 Grade 2). The median time to onset was 4.5 months (range: 5 days to 12 months). All 13 patients received systemic corticosteroids, with resolution in 12. Four patients permanently discontinued OPDIVO due to pneumonitis. Eight patients continued OPDIVO (three after dose delay), of whom two had recurrence of pneumonitis. Peripheral neuropathy: Treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy was reported in 12% (31/266) of all patients receiving OPDIVO. Twenty-eight patients (11%) had new-onset peripheral neuropathy and 3 patients had worsening of neuropathy from baseline. The median time to onset was 50 (range: 1 to 309) days. Complications of allogeneic HSCT after OPDIVO: Of 17 patients with cHL from the CHECKMATE-205 and CHECKMATE-039 trials who underwent allogeneic HSCT after treatment with OPDIVO, 6 patients (35%) died from transplant-related complications. Five deaths occurred in the setting of severe (Grade 3 to 4) or refractory GVHD. Hyperacute GVHD occurred in 2 patients (12%) and Grade 3 or higher GVHD was reported in 5 patients (29%). Hepatic VOD occurred in 1 patient, who received reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT and died of GVHD and multi-organ failure. Table 32 summarizes laboratory abnormalities in patients with cHL. The most common (≥20%) treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities included cytopenias, liver function abnormalities, and increased lipase. Other common findings (≥10%) included increased creatinine, electrolyte abnormalities, and increased amylase.

The trial excluded patients with active autoimmune disease, medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, or recurrent or metastatic carcinoma of the nasopharynx, squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary histology, salivary gland or non-squamous histologies (e.g., mucosal melanoma). Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n=236) or investigator’s choice of either cetuximab (400 mg/m Clinical Studies (14.9) ] 2 initial dose intravenously followed by 250 mg/m 2 weekly), or methotrexate (40 to 60 mg/m 2 intravenously weekly), or docetaxel (30 to 40 mg/m 2 intravenously weekly). The median duration of exposure to nivolumab was 1.9 months (range: 1 day to 16.1+ months) in OPDIVO-treated patients. In this trial, 18% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months and 2.5% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year. The median age of all randomized patients was 60 years (range: 28 to 83); 28% of patients in the OPDIVO group were ≥65 years of age and 37% in the comparator group were ≥65 years of age, 83% were male and 83% were White, 12% were Asian, and 4% were Black. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (20%) or 1 (78%), 45% of patients received only one prior line of systemic therapy, the remaining 55% of patients had two or more prior lines of therapy, and 90% had prior radiation therapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 49% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was discontinued in 14% of patients and was delayed in 24% of patients for an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities occurring in patients with SCCHN were generally similar to those occurring in patients with melanoma and NSCLC. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were pneumonia, dyspnea, respiratory failure, respiratory tract infection, and sepsis. The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of OPDIVO-treated patients and at a higher incidence than investigator’s choice were cough and dyspnea. The most common laboratory abnormalities occurring in ≥10% of OPDIVO-treated patients and at a higher incidence than investigator’s choice were increased alkaline phosphatase, increased amylase, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, and increased TSH. Adjuvant Treatment of Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-274, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of adjuvant OPDIVO versus placebo in adult patients who had undergone radical resection of UC originating in the bladder or upper urinary tract (renal pelvis or ureter) and were at high risk of recurrence [see . Patients received OPDIVO 240 mg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (n=351) or placebo (n=348) until recurrence or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 1 year. The median duration of OPDIVO treatment was 8.8 months (range: 0 to 12.5). Clinical Studies (14.10) ] Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of OPDIVO patients. The most frequent serious adverse reaction reported in ≥2% of patients was urinary tract infection. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1% of patients; these included events of pneumonitis (0.6%). OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 18% of patients. OPDIVO was delayed for adverse reaction in 33% of patients.
