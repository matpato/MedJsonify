    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis : Immediately withhold TEPMETKO in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue TEPMETKO in patients diagnosed with ILD/pneumonitis of any severity. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests. Withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TEPMETKO based on severity. ( 5.2 ) Pancreatic Toxicity : Monitor amylase and lipase. Withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TEPMETKO based on severity. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-fetal toxicity : TEPMETKO can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\tInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis ILD/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 2% patients treated with TEPMETKO, with one patient experiencing a Grade 3 or higher event; this event resulted in death. Five patients (1%) discontinued TEPMETKO due to ILD/pneumonitis. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold TEPMETKO in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.2\tHepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see . Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 18% of patients treated with TEPMETKO. Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT/AST occurred in 4.7% of patients. A fatal adverse reaction of hepatic failure occurred in one patient (0.2%). Four patients (0.8%) discontinued TEPMETKO due to increased ALT/AST. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher increased ALT/AST was 47 days (range 1 to 262). Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Monitor liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of TEPMETKO, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop increased transaminases or bilirubin. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TEPMETKO [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] 5.3\tPancreatic Toxicity Elevations in amylase and lipase levels occurred in patients treated with TEPMETKO [see Increased amylase and/or lipase occurred in 13% of patients treated with TEPMETKO. Grade 3 and 4 increased amylase and/or lipase occurred in 5% and 1.2% of patients, respectively. Monitor amylase and lipase at baseline and regularly during treatment with TEPMETKO. Based on the severity of the adverse drug reaction, temporarily withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TEPMETKO Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.4\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action TEPMETKO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of tepotinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations (teratogenicity) and anomalies at exposures less than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the 450 mg daily clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential or males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TEPMETKO and for one week after the last dose.

    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail elsewhere in the labeling: Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Pancreatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were edema, nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, decreased appetite, and rash. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥ 2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased sodium, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, increased amylase, increased lipase, increased ALT, increased AST, and decreased hemoglobin. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact EMD Serono at 1-800-283-8088 ext. 5563 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to TEPMETKO in 506 patients with solid tumors enrolled in five open-label, single-arm studies receiving TEPMETKO as single agent at a dose of 450 mg once daily. This included 313 patients with NSCLC positive for MET ex14 skipping alterations, who received TEPMETKO in VISION. Among 506 patients who received TEPMETKO, 44% were exposed for 6 months or longer, and 22% were exposed for more than one year. The data described below reflect exposure to TEPMETKO 450 mg once daily in 313 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with MET ex14 skipping alterations in VISION [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 51% of patients who received TEPMETKO. Serious adverse reactions in > 2% of patients included pleural effusion (6%), pneumonia (6%), edema (5%), general health deterioration (3.8%), dyspnea (3.5%), musculoskeletal pain (2.9%), and pulmonary embolism (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.9% of patients who received TEPMETKO, including pneumonitis (0.3%), hepatic failure (0.3%), dyspnea from fluid overload (0.3%), pneumonia (0.3%), sepsis (0.3%), and death of unknown cause (0.3%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 25% of patients who received TEPMETKO. The most frequent adverse reactions (> 1%) leading to permanent discontinuations of TEPMETKO were edema (8%), pleural effusion (1.6%), and general health deterioration (1.6%). Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 53% of patients who received TEPMETKO. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in > 2% of patients who received TEPMETKO included edema (28%), increased blood creatinine (6%), pleural effusion (3.5%), nausea (3.2%), increased ALT (2.9%), pneumonia (2.6%), decreased appetite (2.2%), and dyspnea (2.2%). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 36% of patients who received TEPMETKO. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in > 2% of patients who received TEPMETKO included edema (22%), increased blood creatinine (2.9%), fatigue (2.2%), and pleural effusion (2.2%). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients who received TEPMETKO were edema, nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, decreased appetite, and rash. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥ 2%) were decreased lymphocytes, decreased albumin, decreased sodium, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, increased amylase, increased lipase, increased ALT, increased AST, and decreased hemoglobin.
