    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis : Reported with ARIKAYCE treatment; if hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage patients as medically appropriate. ( 5.1 ) Hemoptysis : Higher frequency of hemoptysis has been reported with ARIKAYCE treatment. If hemoptysis occurs, manage the patients as medically appropriate. ( 5.2 ) Bronchospasm : Higher frequency of bronchospasm has been reported with ARIKAYCE treatment. Treat patients as medically appropriate if this occurs during treatment with ARIKAYCE. ( 5.3 ) Exacerbations of Underlying Pulmonary Disease: Higher frequency of exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease has been reported with ARIKAYCE treatment. Treat patients as medically appropriate if this occurs during treatment with ARIKAYCE. ( 5.4 ) Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions : Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures. ( 5.5 ) Ototoxicity: Higher frequency of ototoxicity has been reported with ARIKAYCE treatment. Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction. If patients develop tinnitus this may be an early symptom of ototoxicity. ( 5.6 ) Nephrotoxicity : Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than the background regimen alone. Aminoglycosides have been associated with nephrotoxicity. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE. ( 5.7 ) Neuromuscular Blockade: Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Closely monitor patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical respiratory assistance may be necessary. ( 5.8 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. ( 5.9 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Hypersensitivity pneumonitis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (reported as allergic alveolitis, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, allergic reaction to ARIKAYCE) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus a background regimen (3.1%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (0%). Most patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis discontinued treatment with ARIKAYCE and received treatment with corticosteroids [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] If hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and manage the patient as medically appropriate . 5.2 Hemoptysis Hemoptysis has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Hemoptysis was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus a background regimen (18.4%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (13.4%) [see . If hemoptysis occurs, manage the patients as medically appropriate Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.3 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Bronchospasm (reported as asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity, bronchospasm, dyspnea, dyspnea exertional, prolonged expiration, throat tightness, wheezing) was reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus a background regimen (28.7%) compared to patients treated with a background regimen alone (10.7%) [see . If bronchospasm occurs during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat the patients as medically appropriate Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.4 Exacerbation of Underlying Pulmonary Disease Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease have been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease (reported as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis) have been reported at a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus a background regimen (15.2%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . If exacerbations of underlying pulmonary disease occur during the use of ARIKAYCE, treat the patients as medically appropriate . 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients taking ARIKAYCE. Signs and symptoms include acute onset of skin and mucosal tissue hypersensitivity reactions (hives, itching, flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula), respiratory difficulty (shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, cough), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain), and cardiovascular signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (tachycardia, low blood pressure, syncope, incontinence, dizziness). Before therapy with ARIKAYCE is instituted, evaluate for previous hypersensitivity reactions to aminoglycosides. If anaphylaxis or a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARIKAYCE and institute appropriate supportive measures. 5.6 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity with use of ARIKAYCE Ototoxicity has been reported with the use of ARIKAYCE in the clinical trials. Ototoxicity (including deafness, dizziness, presyncope, tinnitus, and vertigo) were reported with a higher frequency in patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus a background regimen (17%) compared to patients treated with background regimen alone (9.8%). This was primarily driven by tinnitus (8.1% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs. 0.9% in the background regimen alone arm) and dizziness (6.3% in ARIKAYCE plus background regimen vs. 2.7% in the background regimen alone arm) [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Closely monitor patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction during treatment with ARIKAYCE. If ototoxicity occurs, manage the patient as medically appropriate, including potentially discontinuing ARIKAYCE. Risk of Ototoxicity Due to Mitochondrial DNA Variants Cases of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene ( MT-RNR1 ), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the recommended range. Mitochondrial DNA variants are present in less than 1% of the general US population, and the proportion of the variant carriers who may develop ototoxicity as well as the severity of ototoxicity is unknown. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, consider alternative treatments other than aminoglycosides unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 5.7 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was observed during the clinical trials of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease but not at a higher frequency than the background regimen alone [see . Nephrotoxicity has been associated with the aminoglycosides. Close monitoring of patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction may be needed when prescribing ARIKAYCE. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.8 Neuromuscular Blockade Patients with neuromuscular disorders were not enrolled in ARIKAYCE clinical trials. Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness by blocking the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Closely monitor patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis. If neuromuscular blockade occurs, it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical respiratory assistance may be necessary. 5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Aminoglycosides, including ARIKAYCE, may be associated with total, irreversible, bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero . Patients who use ARIKAYCE during pregnancy, or become pregnant while taking ARIKAYCE should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections of labeling: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hemoptysis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Bronchospasm [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Exacerbation of Underlying Pulmonary Disease [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Anaphylaxis and Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Nephrotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Neuromuscular Blockade [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence â¥10% and higher than control) in the patients with refractory MAC lung disease were: dysphonia, cough, bronchospasm, hemoptysis, musculoskeletal pain, upper airway irritation, ototoxicity, fatigue/asthenia, exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease, diarrhea, nausea, and headache.

Overview of Clinical Trials for Safety Evaluation Within the refractory NTM clinical program, 404 patients that participated in three clinical trials were treated with ARIKAYCE at the dose of 590 mg/day (median duration of exposure to ARIKAYCE was 236.5 days). Trial 1 (NCT#02344004) was an open-label, randomized (2:1), multi-center Phase 3 trial in patients with refractory Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease. Patients were randomized to either 8 months of ARIKAYCE plus a background regimen (n=223) or background regimen alone (n=112). Trial 2 (NCT#02628600) was a single-arm extension of Trial 1 for refractory MAC lung disease patients that failed to achieve negative sputum cultures after 6 months of treatment or had a relapse or recurrence by Month 6 from either study arm of Trial 1. A total of 163 patients (n=90 from the prior background regimen alone arm of Trial 1, and n=73 from the prior ARIKAYCE plus background regimen arm in Trial 1) participated in the trial. Trial 3 (NCT#01315236) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in patients with refractory nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease caused by MAC and Mycobacterium abscessus . Patients were randomized to either ARIKAYCE plus background regimen (N=44) or an inhaled diluted empty liposome placebo plus background regimen (N=45) for 84 days. Across all clinical trials of patients with and without refractory NTM lung infection, 818 patients were exposed to multiple doses of ARIKAYCE. Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation In the three NTM studies, there was a higher incidence of premature discontinuation of ARIKAYCE. In Trial 1, 34.5% discontinued ARIKAYCE prematurely; most were due to adverse reactions (18.8%) and withdrawal by subject (9.9%). In the comparator arm, 10.7% of subjects discontinued their background regimen, with 0.9% due to adverse reactions and 5.4% due to withdrawal by subject. In Trial 2 (the single-arm extension of Trial 1), 37.8% of patients starting on ARIKAYCE discontinued prematurely with 24.4% discontinuing due to adverse reactions. In Trial 3, all 9 (20.5%) premature discontinuations occurred in the ARIKAYCE plus background regimen-treated patients and there were no premature discontinuations in the placebo plus background regimen arm. Serious Adverse Reactions in Trials 1 and 3 In Trial 1, 19.7% of patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen  reported SAR as compared to 16.1% of patients treated with background regimen alone. In addition, in Trial 1 [2 to 1 randomization, ARIKAYCE plus background regimen versus background regimen alone], there were 80 hospitalizations in 41 patients (18.4%) treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen compared to 29 hospitalizations in 15 patients (13.4%) treated with background regimen alone. The most common SARs and reasons for hospitalization in the ARIKAYCE plus background regimen arm were related to exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease and lower respiratory tract infections, such as pneumonia. In Trial 3, 18.2% of patients treated with ARIKAYCE plus background regimen reported SARs compared to 8.9% of patients treated with background regimen plus inhaled placebo. Common Adverse Reactions The incidence of adverse reactions in Trial 1 are displayed in Table 1. Only those adverse reactions with a rate of at least 5% in the ARIKAYCE plus background regimen group and greater than the background regimen alone group, are shown.
