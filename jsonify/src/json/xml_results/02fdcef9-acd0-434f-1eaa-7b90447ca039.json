    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ibandronate sodium tablet is a bisphosphonate indicated for the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. ( 1.1 ). Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low -risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. ( 1.2 ). 1.1 Treatment and Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Ibandronate sodium tablets are indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Ibandronate sodium increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures. 1.2 Important Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of ibandronate sodium tablets for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of three years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Ibandronate sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: Abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia (see Warnings and Precautions [5.1] ) Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes ( see ) Dosage and Administration [2.2] , and Warnings and Precautions [5.1] Hypocalcemia ( see ) Warnings and Precautions [5.2 ] Known hypersensitivity to ibandronate sodium tablets or to any of its excipients. Cases of anaphylaxis have been reported ( see ). Adverse Reactions [6.2] Abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia ( 4 , 5.1 ) Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes ( 4 , 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia ( 4 ) Hypersensitivity to ibandronate sodium tablets ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions and discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Correct hypocalcemia before use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture.( 5.5 ) 5.1 Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Ibandronate sodium tablets, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when ibandronate sodium tablets are given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium tablets and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient (see . Â In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with ibandronate sodium tablets should be used under appropriate supervision. Dosage and Administration [2.2] ) There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials. 5.2 Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium tablets. Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting ibandronate sodium tablets therapy. Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate (see . Dosage and Administration [2.3] ) 5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking ibandronate sodium tablets and other bisphosphonates (see . The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop. Adverse Reactions [6] ) 5.4 Jaw Osteonecrosis Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 Severe Renal Impairment Ibandronate sodium tablets are not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min).",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (greater than 5%) are back pain, dyspepsia, pain in extremity, diarrhea, headache, and myalgia.

Treatment and Prevention of Postmenopausal\nOsteoporosis Daily Dosing The safety of ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 â 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and the placebo group. Table 1 lists adverse reactions from the treatment and prevention studies reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and more frequently in patients treated daily with ibandronate sodium tablets than patients treated with placebo. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence Greater Than or Equal to 2% and in More Patients Treated with Ibandronate Sodium Tablets Than in Patients Treated with Placebo Daily in the Osteoporosis Treatment and Prevention Studies Body System Placebo % (n=1134) Ibandronate Sodium Tablets 2.5 mg % (n=1140) Body as a Whole Back Pain 12 14 Pain in Extremity 6 8 Asthenia 2 4 Allergic Reaction 2 3 Digestive System Dyspepsia 10 12 Diarrhea 5 7 Tooth Disorder 2 4 Vomiting 2 3 Gastritis 2 2 Musculoskeletal System Myalgia 5 6 Joint Disorder 3 4 Arthritis 3 3 Nervous System Headache 6 7 Dizziness 3 4 Vertigo 3 3 Respiratory System Upper Respiratory Infection 33 34 Bronchitis 7 10 Pneumonia 4 6 Pharyngitis 2 3 Urogenital System Urinary Tract Infection 4 6 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in the placebo and ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily groups were: dyspepsia (10% vs. 12%), diarrhea (5% vs. 7%), and abdominal pain (5% vs. 6%). Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected musculoskeletal adverse reactions in the placebo and ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). Ocular Adverse Events Reports in the medical literature indicate that bisphosphonates may be associated with ocular inflammation such as iritis and scleritis. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued. There were no reports of ocular inflammation in studies with ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily. Monthly Dosing The safety of ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg once monthly in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a two year trial which enrolled 1583 patients aged 54 to 81 years, with 395 patients exposed to ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily and 396 exposed to ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly. Patients with active or significant pre-existing gastrointestinal disease were excluded from this trial. Patients with dyspepsia or concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in this study. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. After one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.3% in both the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and the ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and 7% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was 9% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and 8% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly group. Table 2 lists the adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Events The incidence of adverse events in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily and ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly groups were: back pain (4% vs. 5%), arthralgia (4% vs. 6%) and myalgia (1% vs. 2%). Acute Phase Reactions Symptoms consistent with acute phase reactions have been reported with bisphosphonate use. Over the two years of the study, the overall incidence of acute phase reaction symptoms was 3% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and 9% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly group. These incidence rates are based on the reporting of any of 33 acute-phase reaction like symptoms within 3 days of the monthly dosing and lasting 7 days or less. Influenza like illness was reported in no patients in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and 2% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly group. Ocular Adverse Events Two patients who received ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg once-monthly experienced ocular inflammation, one was a case of uveitis and the other scleritis. One hundred sixty (160) postmenopausal women without osteoporosis participated in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg once-monthly for prevention of bone loss. Seventy-seven subjects received ibandronate sodium tablets and 83 subjects received placebo. The overall pattern of adverse events was similar to that previously observed. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ibandronate sodium tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Allergic reactions including anaphylactic reaction/shock with fatalities, angioedema, bronchospasm, asthma exacerbations, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis bullous have been reported (see . CONTRAINDICATIONS [4] ) Hypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients treated with ibandronate sodium tablets (see . WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS [5.2] ) Musculoskeletal Pain Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating, has been reported (see .
