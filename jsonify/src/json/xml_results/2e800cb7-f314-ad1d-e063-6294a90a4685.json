    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE NUZYRA is a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the following infections caused by susceptible microorganisms ( 1 ): Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) ( 1.1 ) Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) ( 1.2 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of NUZYRA and other antibacterial drugs, NUZYRA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) NUZYRA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates), Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus parainfluenzae , Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila , Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae . 1.2 Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) NUZYRA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Staphylococcus lugdunensis , Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus anginosus grp. (includes S. anginosus , S. intermedius , and S. constellatus ), Enterococcus faecalis , Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 1.3 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of NUZYRA and other antibacterial drugs, NUZYRA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS NUZYRA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to omadacycline or tetracycline class antibacterial drugs, or to any of the excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Known hypersensitivity to omadacycline, tetracycline class antibacterial drugs or any of the excipients in NUZYRA ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Mortality Imbalance in Patients with CABP : In the CABP trial, mortality rate of 2% was observed in NUZYRA-treated patients compared to 1% in moxifloxacin-treated patients. The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established. Closely monitor clinical response to therapy in CABP patients, particularly in those at higher risk for mortality. ( 5.1 , 6.1 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia : The use of NUZYRA during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: The use of NUZYRA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea 5.5 ) 5.1 Mortality Imbalance in Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Mortality imbalance was observed in the CABP clinical trial with eight deaths (2%) occurring in patients treated with NUZYRA compared to four deaths (1%) in patients treated with moxifloxacin. The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established. All deaths, in both treatment arms, occurred in patients >65 years of age; most patients had multiple comorbidities [see . The causes of death varied and included worsening and/or complications of infection and underlying conditions. Closely monitor clinical response to therapy in CABP patients, particularly in those at higher risk for mortality Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.2 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The use of NUZYRA during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the tetracycline class drugs, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported with tetracycline class drugs. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if NUZYRA is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.3 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of NUZYRA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if NUZYRA is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ] 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with NUZYRA [see Life-threatening hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported with other tetracycline class antibacterial drugs. NUZYRA is structurally similar to other tetracycline class antibacterial drugs and is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline class antibacterial drugs Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. [see . Discontinue NUZYRA if an allergic reaction occurs. Contraindications (4) ] 5.5 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Tetracycline Class Effects NUZYRA is structurally similar to tetracycline class of antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions. Adverse reactions including photosensitivity, fixed drug eruption, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, pancreatitis, and abnormal liver function tests, have been reported for other tetracycline class antibacterial drugs, and may occur with NUZYRA. Discontinue NUZYRA if any of these adverse reactions are suspected. 5.7 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing NUZYRA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Indications and Usage (1.3) ].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of labeling: Mortality Imbalance in Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Tooth Development and Enamel Hypoplasia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Inhibition of Bone Growth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Tetracycline Class Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥2%) are nausea, vomiting, infusion site reactions, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, hypertension, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, and constipation.

Overview of the Safety Evaluation of NUZYRA NUZYRA was evaluated in three Phase 3 clinical trials (Trial 1, Trial 2 and Trial 3). These trials included a single Phase 3 trial in CABP patients (Trial 1) and two Phase 3 trials in ABSSSI patients (Trial 2 and Trial 3). Across all Phase 3 trials, a total of 1073 patients were treated with NUZYRA (382 patients in Trial 1 and 691 in Trials 2 and 3 of which 368 patients were treated with only oral NUZYRA). Clinical Trial Experience in Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Trial 1 was a Phase 3 CABP trial that enrolled 774 adult patients, 386 randomized to NUZYRA (382 received at least one dose of NUZYRA and 4 patients did not receive the study drug) and 388 randomized to moxifloxacin (all 388 received at least one dose of moxifloxacin). The mean age of patients treated with NUZYRA was 61 years (range 19 to 97 years) and 42% were greater than or equal to 65 years of age. Overall, patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (53.7%), white (92.4%), and had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 27.3 kg/m 2 . Approximately 47% of NUZYRA treated patients had CrCl <90 ml/min. Patients were administered an IV to oral switch dosage regimen of NUZYRA. The total treatment duration was 7 to 14 days. Mean duration of IV treatment was 5.7 days and mean total duration of treatment was 9.6 days in both treatment arms. Imbalance in Mortality In Trial 1, eight deaths (2%) occurred in 382 patients treated with NUZYRA as compared to four deaths (1%) in 388 patients treated with moxifloxacin. All deaths, in both treatment arms, occurred in patients >65 years of age. The causes of death varied and included worsening and/or complications of infection and underlying conditions. The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In Trial 1, a total of 23/382 (6.0%) patients treated with NUZYRA and 26/388 (6.7%) patients treated with moxifloxacin experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reactions occurred in 21/382 (5.5%) patients treated with NUZYRA and 27/388 (7.0%) patients treated with moxifloxacin. Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 4 lists the most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥2% of patients receiving NUZYRA in Trial 1.

Trial 3 was a Phase 3 ABSSSI trial that enrolled 735 adult patients, 368 randomized to NUZYRA and 367 randomized to linezolid. In Trial 2 (IV to oral switch trial), the mean age of patients treated with NUZYRA was 47 years (range 19 to 88). Overall, patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (62.8%), white (91.0%) and had a mean BMI of 28.1 kg/m 2 . In Trial 3 (oral only trial), the mean age of patients was 43 years (range 18 to 86). Patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (65.8%), white (88.9%), and had a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m 2 . In Trials 2 and 3, approximately 12% of NUZYRA treated patients had CrCl <90 ml/min. Overall, the mean and median calculated lesion area was similar across both trials. Trial 2 required at least 3 days of IV treatment followed by switch to oral regimen based on physician's discretion. Mean duration of IV treatment in Trial 2 was 4 days and mean total duration of treatment was 9 days in both treatment arms. In Trial 3, only oral therapy was administered, and mean total duration of treatment was 8 days in both treatment arms. The median days on treatment in the pooled ABSSSI trials was 9 days for both NUZYRA and linezolid. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the pooled ABSSSI trials, serious adverse reactions occurred in 16/691 (2.3%) of patients treated with NUZYRA and 13/689 (1.9%) of patients treated with comparator. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 12 (1.7%) NUZYRA treated patients, and 10 (1.5%) comparator treated patients. There was 1 death (0.1%) reported in NUZYRA treated patients and 3 deaths (0.4%) reported in linezolid patients in ABSSSI trials.
