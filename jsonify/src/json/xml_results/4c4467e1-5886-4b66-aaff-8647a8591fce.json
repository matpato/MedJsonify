    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Treatment of Acute Malaria Infections Mefloquine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate acute malaria caused by mefloquine-susceptible strains of P. falciparum (both chloroquine-susceptible and resistant strains) or by Plasmodium vivax. There are insufficient clinical data to document the effect of mefloquine in malaria caused by P. ovale or P. malariae. Note: Patients with acute P. vivax malaria, treated with mefloquine, are at high risk of relapse because mefloquine does not eliminate exoerythrocytic (hepatic phase) parasites. To avoid relapse, after initial treatment of the acute infection with mefloquine, patients should subsequently be treated with an 8-aminoquinoline derivative (e.g., primaquine). Prevention of Malaria Mefloquine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria infections, including prophylaxis of chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Use of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to mefloquine or related compounds (e.g., quinine and quinidine) or to any of the excipients contained in the formulation. Mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should not be prescribed for prophylaxis in patients with active depression, a recent history of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia or other major psychiatric disorders, or with a history of convulsions.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS In case of life-threatening, serious or overwhelming malaria infections due to P. falciparum, patients should be treated with an intravenous antimalarial drug. Following completion of intravenous treatment, mefloquine may be given to complete the course of therapy. QTc Interval Prolongation and Drug Interactions Halofantrine should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval (see ). CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Elimination Ketoconazole should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval. Ketoconazole increases plasma concentrations and elimination half-life of mefloquine following coadministration (see and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Elimination ). PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of mefloquine and quinine or quinidine may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities. Psychiatric and Neurologic Adverse Reactions Mefloquine may cause neuropsychiatric adverse reactions in adults and children. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can be difficult to identify in children. Therefore, vigilance is required to monitor for the occurrence of these symptoms, especially in nonverbal children. Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric symptoms ranging from anxiety, paranoia, and depression to hallucinations and psychotic behavior can occur with mefloquine use. Symptoms may occur early in the course of mefloquine use. In some cases, these symptoms have been reported to continue for months or years after mefloquine has been stopped. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicide have been reported. Mefloquine should not be prescribed for prophylaxis in patients with active depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, or schizophrenia or other major psychiatric disorders. Mefloquine should be used with caution in patients with a previous history of depression. During prophylactic use, the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms such as acute anxiety, depression, restlessness or confusion suggest a risk for more serious psychiatric disturbances or neurologic adverse reactions. In these cases, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative medication should be substituted. Neurologic Adverse Reactions Neurologic symptoms such as dizziness or vertigo, tinnitus, and loss of balance have been reported. These adverse reactions may occur early in the course of mefloquine use and in some cases have been reported to continue for months or years after mefloquine has been stopped. Dizziness or vertigo, tinnitus, and loss of balance have been reported to be permanent in some cases. During prophylactic use, if neurologic symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative medication should be substituted. Caution should be exercised with regard to activities requiring alertness and fine motor coordination, such as driving, piloting aircraft, operating machinery, and deep-sea diving, while symptoms persist. Mefloquine may increase the risk of convulsions in patients with epilepsy. The drug should therefore be prescribed only for curative treatment in such patients and only if there are compelling medical reasons for its use (see ). PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions Concomitant administration of mefloquine and quinine or chloroquine may increase the risk of convulsions. Ocular Effects Eye disorders, including but not limited to optic neuropathy and retinal disorders, have been reported during treatment with mefloquine. Any patient presenting with visual symptoms should be referred to the treating physician and an ophthalmologist as certain conditions (such as retinal disorders or optic neuropathy) may require stopping treatment with mefloquine (see , PRECAUTIONS ANIMAL ). TOXICOLOGYPRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with mefloquine use. Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with impaired liver function the elimination of mefloquine may be prolonged, leading to higher plasma levels and a higher risk of adverse reactions. Long-Term Use This drug has been administered for longer than one year. If the drug is to be administered for a prolonged period, periodic evaluations including liver function tests and evaluations for neuropsychiatric effects should be performed (see and WARNINGS ). Periodic ophthalmic examinations are recommended (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing ). WARNINGS Cardiac Effects Parenteral studies in animals show that mefloquine, a myocardial depressant, possesses 20% of the anti-fibrillatory action of quinidine and produces 50% of the increase in the PR interval reported with quinine. The effect of mefloquine on the compromised cardiovascular system has not been evaluated. However, transitory and clinically silent ECG alterations have been reported during the use of mefloquine; alterations included sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, first degree AV-block, prolongation of the QTc interval and abnormal T waves (see also cardiovascular effects under and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). The benefits of mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac disease. ADVERSE REACTIONS Drug Resistance and Cross-Resistance Geographical drug resistance patterns of P. falciparum occur and the preferred choice of malaria prophylaxis might be different from one area to another. For example, resistance of P. falciparum to mefloquine has been reported, predominantly in areas of multi-drug resistance in South-East Asia. Cross-resistance between mefloquine and halofantrine and cross-resistance between mefloquine and quinine have been observed in some regions. Agranulocytosis and Aplastic Anemia Cases of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia have been reported (see ). ADVERSE REACTIONS Laboratory Tests Periodic evaluation of hepatic function should be performed during prolonged prophylaxis. Information for Patients Medication Guide: As required by law, a mefloquine hydrochloride tablets Medication Guide is supplied to patients when mefloquine is dispensed. An information wallet card is also supplied to patients when mefloquine is dispensed. Patients should be instructed to read the Medication Guide when mefloquine is received and to carry the information wallet card with them when they are taking mefloquine. The complete texts of the Medication Guide and information wallet card are reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised: that malaria can be a life-threatening infection that mefloquine hydrochloride tablets are being prescribed to help prevent or treat this serious infection; that some patients are unable to take this medication because of side effects, including dizziness or vertigo and loss of balance, and it may be necessary to change medications. In some patients it has been reported that these symptoms may continue for months or years after discontinuation of the drug and can be permanent in some cases; that insomnia may occur that when used as prophylaxis, the first dose of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should be taken one week prior to arrival in an endemic area; that if the patients experience psychiatric adverse reactions such as acute anxiety, depression, restlessness or confusion, or suicidal ideation, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative medication should be substituted; that no chemoprophylactic regimen is 100% effective, and protective clothing, insect repellents, and bed nets are important components of malaria prophylaxis; to seek medical attention for any febrile illness that occurs after return from a malaria area and to inform their physician that they may have been exposed to malaria. Drug Interactions Drug-drug interactions with mefloquine have not been explored in detail. There is one report of cardiopulmonary arrest, with full recovery, in a patient who was taking a beta blocker (propranolol) (see ). The effects of mefloquine on the compromised cardiovascular system have not been evaluated. The benefits of mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac disease. PRECAUTIONS, Cardiac Effects Halofantrine Halofantrine should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval (see ). WARNINGS Other Antimalarial Drugs Concomitant administration of mefloquine and other related antimalarial compounds (e.g., quinine, quinidine and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions (see ). If these drugs are to be used in the initial treatment of severe malaria, mefloquine administration should be delayed at least 12 hours after the last dose. Clinically significant QTc prolongation has not been found with mefloquine alone. WARNINGS Ketoconazole (Potent Inhibitor of CYP3A4) Coadministration of a single 500 mg oral dose of mefloquine with 400 mg of ketoconazole once daily for 10 days in 8 healthy volunteers resulted in an increase in the mean C max and AUC of mefloquine by 64% and 79%, respectively, and an increase in the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine from 322 hours to 448 hours. Ketoconazole should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval (see ). WARNINGS Other Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval Coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (e.g., anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H 1 -blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval. There are no data that conclusively establish whether the concomitant administration of mefloquine and the above listed agents has an effect on cardiac function. Anticonvulsants In patients taking an anticonvulsant (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin), the concomitant use of mefloquine may reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of the anticonvulsant. Therefore, patients concurrently taking anti-seizure medication and mefloquine should have the blood level of their anti-seizure medication monitored and the dosage adjusted appropriately (see ). PRECAUTIONS Vaccines When mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccines, attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded. Vaccinations with attenuated live bacteria should therefore be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets. Rifampin (Potent Inducer of CYP3A4) Coadministration of a single 500 mg oral dose of mefloquine and 600 mg of rifampin once daily for 7 days in 7 healthy Thai volunteers resulted in a decrease in the mean C max and AUC of mefloquine by 19% and 68%, respectively, and a decrease in the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine from 305 hours to 113 hours. Rifampin should be used cautiously in patients taking mefloquine. Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 Mefloquine does not inhibit or induce the CYP 450 enzyme system. Thus, concomitant administration of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets and substrates of the CYP 450 enzyme system is not expected to result in a drug interaction. However, mefloquine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may modify the pharmacokinetics/metabolism of mefloquine, leading to an increase in mefloquine plasma concentrations and potential risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Similarly, inducers of CYP3A4 may modify the pharmacokinetics/metabolism of mefloquine, leading to a decrease in mefloquine plasma concentrations and potential reduction in efficacy of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets. Therefore, mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should also be used with caution when administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 inducers. Substrates and Inhibitors of P-glycoprotein It has been shown in vitro that mefloquine is a substrate and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Therefore, drug-drug interactions could also occur with drugs that are substrates or are known to modify the expression of this transporter. The clinical relevance of these interactions is not known to date. Other Potential Interactions No other drug interactions are known. Nevertheless, the effects of mefloquine on travelers receiving concomitant medications, particularly diabetics or patients using anticoagulants, should be checked before departure. In clinical trials, the concomitant administration of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine did not alter the adverse reaction profile of mefloquine. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis: The carcinogenic potential of mefloquine was studied in rats and mice in 2-year feeding studies at doses of up to 30 mg/kg/day. No treatment-related increases in tumors of any type were noted. Mutagenesis: The mutagenic potential of mefloquine was studied in a variety of assay systems including: Ames test, a host-mediated assay in mice, fluctuation tests and a mouse micronucleus assay. Several of these assays were performed with and without prior metabolic activation. In no instance was evidence obtained for the mutagenicity of mefloquine. Impairment of Fertility: Fertility studies in rats at doses of 5, 20, and 50 mg/kg/day of mefloquine have demonstrated adverse effects on fertility in the male at the high dose of 50 mg/kg/day, and in the female at doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg/day. Histopathological lesions were noted in the epididymides from male rats at doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg/day. Administration of 250 mg/week of mefloquine (base) in adult males for 22 weeks failed to reveal any deleterious effects on human spermatozoa. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Data from published studies in pregnant women have shown no increase in the risk of teratogenic effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes following mefloquine treatment or prophylaxis during pregnancy. Reproduction studies in mice, rats and rabbits have shown teratogenic effects at doses similar to the clinical acute treatment dose in humans. Because the studies in humans cannot rule out the possibility of harm, mefloquine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Published data on mefloquine use during pregnancy include randomized controlled trials, intervention trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series. These data showed that pregnant women who took mefloquine at various doses for both prevention and treatment of malaria did not have an increased risk of teratogenic effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to the background rate in the general population. These data include more than 700 exposures to mefloquine in the first trimester of pregnancy and over 2,000 exposures in the second and third trimester. Mefloquine administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits was teratogenic at doses similar to the clinical acute treatment dose of 21 to 25 mg/kg, based on body surface area comparisons. In all three animal species, CNS effects (e.g., exencephaly, hydrocephaly or partially missing medulla oblongata) and craniofacial malformations were observed. At the same doses, mefloquine was also embryotoxic in mice and rabbits. All of these findings were observed at doses that were maternally toxic. Nursing Mothers Mefloquine is excreted in human milk in small amounts, the activity of which is unknown. Based on a study in a few subjects, low concentrations (3% to 4%) of mefloquine were excreted in human milk following a dose equivalent to 250 mg of the free base. Caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Use of mefloquine to treat acute, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of mefloquine in adults with additional data from published open-label and comparative trials using mefloquine to treat malaria caused by P. falciparum in patients younger than 16 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of mefloquine for the treatment of malaria in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established. In several studies, the administration of mefloquine for the treatment of malaria was associated with early vomiting in pediatric patients. Early vomiting was cited in some reports as a possible cause of treatment failure. If a second dose is not tolerated, the patient should be monitored closely and alternative malaria treatment considered if improvement is not observed within a reasonable period of time (see and WARNINGS ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Geriatric Use Clinical studies of mefloquine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Since electrocardiographic abnormalities have been observed in individuals treated with mefloquine (see ) and underlying cardiac disease is more prevalent in elderly than in younger patients, the benefits of mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse cardiac effects in elderly patients. PRECAUTIONS",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical At the doses used for treatment of acute malaria infections, the symptoms possibly attributable to drug administration cannot be distinguished from those symptoms usually attributable to the disease itself. Among subjects who received mefloquine for prophylaxis of malaria, the most frequently observed adverse experience was vomiting (3%). Dizziness, syncope, extrasystoles and other complaints affecting less than 1% were also reported. Two serious adverse reactions were cardiopulmonary arrest in one patient shortly after ingesting a single prophylactic dose of mefloquine while concomitantly using propranolol (see ), and encephalopathy of unknown etiology during prophylactic mefloquine administration. The relationship of encephalopathy to drug administration could not be clearly established. PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions Among subjects who received mefloquine for treatment, the most frequently observed adverse experiences included: dizziness, myalgia, nausea, fever, headache, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, skin rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, and tinnitus. Those side effects occurring in less than 1% included bradycardia, hair loss, emotional problems, pruritus, asthenia, transient emotional disturbances and telogen effluvium (loss of resting hair). Seizures have also been reported. Laboratory The most frequently observed laboratory alterations which could be possibly attributable to drug administration were decreased hematocrit, transient elevation of transaminases, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. These alterations were observed in patients with acute malaria who received treatment doses of the drug and were attributed to the disease itself. During prophylactic administration of mefloquine to indigenous populations in malaria-endemic areas, the following alterations in laboratory values were observed: transient elevation of transaminases, leukocytosis or thrombocytopenia. Because of the long half-life of mefloquine, adverse reactions to mefloquine may occur or persist up to several weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Postmarketing Postmarketing surveillance indicates that the same kind of adverse reactions are reported during prophylaxis, as well as acute treatment. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to mefloquine exposure. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, loose stools or diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness or vertigo, loss of balance, and neuropsychiatric events such as headache, somnolence, and sleep disorders (insomnia, abnormal dreams). These adverse reactions may occur early in the course of mefloquine use. It has been reported that dizziness or vertigo, tinnitus and hearing impairment, and loss of balance may continue for months or years after discontinuation of the drug and may be permanent in some cases. More severe neuropsychiatric disorders have been reported such as: sensory and motor neuropathies (including paresthesia, tremor and ataxia), convulsions, agitation or restlessness, anxiety, depression, mood swings, panic attacks, memory impairment, confusion, hallucinations, aggression, psychotic or paranoid reactions and encephalopathy. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicide have been reported. Other less frequently reported adverse reactions include: Cardiovascular Disorders: circulatory disturbances (hypotension, hypertension, flushing, syncope), chest pain, tachycardia or palpitation, bradycardia, irregular heart rate, extrasystoles, A-V block, and other transient cardiac conduction alterations. Skin Disorders: rash, exanthema, erythema, urticaria, pruritus, edema, hair loss, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Musculoskeletal Disorders: muscle weakness, muscle cramps, myalgia, and arthralgia. Respiratory Disorders: dyspnea, pneumonitis of possible allergic etiology. Hepatobiliary Disorders: drug-related hepatic disorders from asymptomatic transient transaminase elevations to hepatic failure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia. Ocular Disorders: visual impairment, vision blurred, cataracts, retinal disorders, optic neuropathy. Other Symptoms: asthenia, malaise, fatigue, fever, hyperhidrosis, chills, dyspepsia and loss of appetite."
