    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are a biguanide indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. (1)",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with: Severe renal impairment (eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Known hypersensitivity to metformin. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. Severe renal impairment: (eGFR below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ) (4 , 5.1 ) Known hypersensitivity to metformin (4) Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis: See boxed warning. (5.1) Vitamin B Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 Deficiency: 12 levels. Monitor hematological parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. (5.2) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. (5.3) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]: Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug Interactions : The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin­- associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions ( Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. 7 )]. Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Radiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin­- treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Excessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Vitamin B 12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Adverse reactions occurring > 5 % in metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets clinical trials: hypoglycemia, diarrhea, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials conducted in the U.S., over 1,000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1,500 to 2,000 mg/day in active-controlled and placebo-controlled studies with the 500 mg dosage form. In the add-on to sulfonylurea study, patients receiving background glyburide therapy were randomized to receive add-on treatment of either one of three different regimens of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo. In total, 431 patients received metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide and 144 patients received placebo and glyburide. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5 % of patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets that were more common in the combined metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide group than in the placebo and glyburide group are shown in Table 1. In 0.7 % of patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and glyburide, diarrhea was responsible for discontinuation of study medication compared to no patients in the placebo and glyburide group. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by > 5 %* of Patients for the Combined Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets Groups Versus Placebo Group Adverse Reaction Metformin Hydrochloride Extended- Release Tablets +   Glyburide (n = 431) Placebo + Glyburide (n = 144) Hypoglycemia 14% 5% Diarrhea 13% 6% Nausea 7% 4% *Adverse reactions that were more common in the metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets -treated than in the placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Tests Vitamin B 12 Concentrations In clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7 % of patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."
