    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE POSFREA is indicated in adults for prevention of: acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC). acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC). postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for up to 24 hours following surgery. Efficacy beyond 24 hours has not been demonstrated. As with other antiemetics, routine prophylaxis is not recommended in patients in whom there is little expectation that nausea and/or vomiting will occur postoperatively. In patients where nausea and vomiting must be avoided during the postoperative period, POSFREA is recommended even where the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting is low. POSFREA is indicated in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 17 years of age for prevention of: acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. POSFREA is a serotonin-3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonist indicated in: Adults for prevention of : acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC).  ( 1 ) acute nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC). ( 1 ) postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) for up to 24 hours following surgery.

    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS POSFREA is contraindicated in patients known to have hypersensitivity to palonosetron [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypersensitivity to palonosetron or any of its components. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock : reported in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. If symptoms occur, discontinue POSFREA and initiate appropriate medical treatment. ( 5.1 ) Serotonin syndrome : reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists alone, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock, have been reported with administration of palonosetron [see . These reactions occurred in patients with or without known hypersensitivity to other 5-HT Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 3 receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue POSFREA and initiate appropriate medical treatment. Do not reinitiate POSFREA in patients who have previously experienced symptoms of hypersensitivity [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of another 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist use occurred in a post- anesthesia care unit or an infusion center. Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of POSFREA and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue POSFREA and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if POSFREA is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious or otherwise clinically significant adverse reactions reported in other sections of labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults (≥5%) are: headache and constipation ( 6.1 ) postoperative nausea and vomiting (≥ 2%) are: QT prolongation, bradycardia, headache, and constipation ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Avyxa Pharma, LLC at 1-888-520-0954 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatc h. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of POSFREA has been established from adequate and well-controlled studies of another intravenous formulation of palonosetron [see . Below is a display of the adverse reactions of palonosetron in these adequate and well-controlled studies. Clinical Studies (14) ] Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Adults In double-blind randomized clinical trials for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by MEC or HEC, 1374 adult patients received a single dose of palonosetron, ondansetron (Studies 1 and 3) or dolasetron (Study 2) administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy [see . Adverse reactions were similar in frequency and severity in all three treatment groups. Common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients in these trials are shown in Table 2. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions* in Adults with Receiving MEC (Studies 1 and 2) or HEC (Study 3) *Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Adverse Reaction Palonosetron 0.25 mg intravenously (N=633) Ondansetron 32 mg intravenously (N=410) Dolasetron 100 mg intravenously (N=194) Headache 9% 8% 16% Constipation 5% 2% 6% Diarrhea 1% 2% 2% Dizziness 1% 2% 2% Fatigue < 1% 1% 2% Abdominal Pain < 1% < 1% 2% Insomnia < 1% 1% 2% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% or less of patients in any treatment group, in Studies 1, 2 and 3 were: Cardiac disorders :      non-sustained tachycardia, bradycardia, myocardial ischemia,      extrasystoles, sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular      extrasystoles. Skin & subcutaneous      tissue disorders : allergic dermatitis, rash. Ear &labyrinth      disorders : motion sickness, tinnitus. Gastrointestinal disorders :      diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, dry mouth, hiccups and flatulence. General disorders and      administration site conditions :  weakness, fatigue, fever, hot flash,      flu-like syndrome. Investigations : QT prolongation,      transient, asymptomatic increases in AST and/or ALT and bilirubin and      these changes occurred predominantly in patients receiving HEC. Metabolism and nutrition      disorders : hyperkalemia, electrolyte fluctuations, hyperglycemia,      metabolic acidosis, appetite decrease, anorexia. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue      disorders : arthralgia. Nervous System disorders :      dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, hypersomnia, paresthesia. Psychiatric disorders :      anxiety, euphoric mood. Renal      and urinary disorders : urinary retention, glycosuria. Vascular disorders : vein discoloration, vein distention, hypotension, hypertension. In other studies, two subjects experienced severe constipation following a single dose of approximately 0.75 mg (three times the recommended dose). Pediatrics Aged 2 Months to 17 Years In a pediatric clinical trial, 163 pediatric cancer patients with a mean age of eight years received a single 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) intravenous infusion of palonosetron 30 minutes before beginning the first cycle of emetogenic chemotherapy [see . Adverse reactions were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving palonosetron for up to four chemotherapy cycles. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of palonosetron-treated patients: Clinical Studies (14.2) ] Nervous System disorders : headache, dizziness, dyskinesia. General disorders and administration site conditions : infusion site pain. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : allergic dermatitis, skin disorder. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of adults receiving palonosetron 0.075 mg intravenously immediately before induction of anesthesia in three randomized placebo-controlled trials [see are shown in Table 3. Rates of adverse reactions between palonosetron and placebo groups were similar. Some events are known to be associated with, or may be exacerbated by, concomitant perioperative and intraoperative medications administered in this surgical population. A thorough QT/QTc study demonstrated palonosetron does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent Clinical Studies (14.3) ] [see . Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] Table 3: Common Adverse Reactions* in Trials of Adults with Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting *Reported in at least 2% of patients in any treatment group Adverse Reaction Palonosetron 0.075 mg intravenously (N=336) Placebo (N=369) Electrocardiogram QT prolongation 5% 3% Bradycardia 4% 4% Headache 3% 4% Constipation 2% 3% Less common adverse reactions, reported in 1% or less of patients, in these PONV clinical trials were: Cardiac disorders : sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles. The frequency of these adverse effects did not appear to be different from placebo. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : pruritus. Gastrointestinal disorders : flatulence, dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, salivary hypersecretion, dyspepsia, diarrhea, intestinal hypomotility. General disorders and administration site conditions : chills, generalized edema. Investigations : increases in AST and/or ALT, hepatic enzyme increased, QTc prolongation, blood pressure decreased, platelet count decreased, T wave amplitude decreased. Metabolism and nutrition disorders : hypokalemia, anorexia. Nervous System disorders : dizziness. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : hypoventilation, laryngospasm. Renal and urinary disorders : Urinary retention. Vascular disorders : Hypotension, Hypertension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of palonosetron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions : including dyspnea, bronchospasm, swelling/edema, erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Injection site reactions : including burning, induration, discomfort and pain"
