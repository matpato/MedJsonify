    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5\tWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher ZOCOR dosage. Chinese patients may be at higher risk for myopathy. Discontinue ZOCOR if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue ZOCOR in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing ZOCOR dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. ( 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.5 , 8.6 , 8.8 ) Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported. Discontinue ZOCOR if IMNM is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzyme before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue ZOCOR. ( 4 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) 5.1\tMyopathy and Rhabdomyolysis ZOCOR may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including ZOCOR. In clinical studies of 24,747 ZOCOR-treated patients with a median follow-up of 4 years, the incidence of myopathy, defined as unexplained muscle weakness, pain, or tenderness accompanied by creatinine kinase (CK) increases greater than ten times the upper limit of normal (10xULN), were approximately 0.03%, 0.08%, and 0.61% in patients treated with ZOCOR 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg daily, respectively. In another clinical study of 12,064 ZOCOR-treated patients (with a history of myocardial infarction) with a mean follow-up of 6.7 years, the incidences of myopathy in patients taking ZOCOR 20 mg and 80 mg daily were approximately 0.02% and 0.9%, respectively. The incidences of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK >40xULN) in patients taking ZOCOR 20 mg and 80 mg daily were approximately 0% and 0.4%, respectively [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher ZOCOR dosage; Chinese patients on ZOCOR may be at higher risk for myopathy [see . The risk of myopathy is increased by elevated plasma levels of simvastatin and simvastatin acid. The risk is also greater in patients taking an 80 mg daily dosage of ZOCOR compared with patients taking lower ZOCOR dosages and compared with patients using other statins with similar or greater LDL-C-lowering efficacy Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ] [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ZOCOR is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is required, temporarily suspend ZOCOR during the duration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment. The concomitant use of ZOCOR with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, or danazol is also contraindicated [see . Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] ZOCOR dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking lomitapide, verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone, amlodipine or ranolazine [see . ZOCOR use should be temporarily suspended in patients taking daptomycin. Lipid modifying doses (≥1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and grapefruit juice may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Use the 80 mg daily dosage of ZOCOR only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg daily chronically without evidence of muscle toxicity [see . If patients treated with an 80 mg daily dosage of ZOCOR are prescribed an interacting drug that increases the risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, switch to an alternate statin Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Discontinue ZOCOR if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if ZOCOR is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue ZOCOR in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the ZOCOR dosage and advise patients receiving an 80 mg daily dosage of ZOCOR of the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2\tImmune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue ZOCOR if IMNM is suspected. 5.3\tHepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ZOCOR [see . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than 3xULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ZOCOR in clinical studies. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with ZOCOR. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including ZOCOR. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury. Consider liver enzyme testing before ZOCOR initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. ZOCOR is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see . If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue ZOCOR. Contraindications (4) ] 5.4\tIncreases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including ZOCOR. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.",
    "adverseReactions": "6\tADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) are upper respiratory infection, headache, abdominal pain, constipation, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Organon LLC, a subsidiary of Organon & Co., at 1-844-674-3200 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical studies, 2,423 adult patients were exposed to ZOCOR with a median duration of follow-up of approximately 18 months. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) in these ZOCOR clinical studies were: upper respiratory infections (9%), headache (7%), abdominal pain (7%), constipation (7%), and nausea (5%). Overall, 1.4% of patients discontinued ZOCOR due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were: gastrointestinal disorders (0.5%), myalgia (0.1%), and arthralgia (0.1%). In a Cardiovascular Outcomes Study (the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [Study 4S]), adult patients (age range 35-71 years, 19% women, 100% Caucasians) were treated with 20-40 mg per day of ZOCOR or placebo over a median of 5.4 years [see ; adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Clinical Studies (14) ] Table 1 . Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported ≥2% of Patients Treated with ZOCOR and Greater than Placebo in Study 4S % Placebo (N = 2,223) % ZOCOR (N = 2,221) Bronchitis 6.3 6.6 Abdominal pain 5.8 5.9 Atrial fibrillation 5.1 5.7 Gastritis 3.9 4.9 Eczema 3.0 4.5 Vertigo 4.2 4.5 Diabetes mellitus 3.6 4.2 Insomnia 3.8 4.0 Myalgia 3.2 3.7 Urinary tract infection 3.1 3.2 Edema/swelling 2.3 2.7 Headache 2.1 2.5 Sinusitis 1.8 2.3 Constipation 1.6 2.2 Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis In clinical studies with a median follow-up of at least 4 years, in which 24,747 patients received ZOCOR , the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness, pain, or tenderness accompanied by CK increases greater than 10xULN) was approximately 0.03%, 0.08%, and 0.61% for the ZOCOR 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg daily groups, respectively. In a clinical outcomes study in which 12,064 adult patients with a history of myocardial infarction were treated with ZOCOR (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum CK >10x [1200 U/L] ULN) in patients taking ZOCOR 20 mg and 80 mg daily was approximately 0.02% and 0.9%, respectively. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK >40xULN) in patients on ZOCOR 20 mg and 80 mg daily was approximately 0% and 0.4%, respectively. The incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were highest during the first year and then decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In another clinical outcomes study in which 10,269 adult patients were treated with ZOCOR 40 mg per day (mean follow-up of 5 years), the incidence of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis was <0.1% in patients treated with ZOCOR. Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests Moderate (less than 3xULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported with use of ZOCOR. Persistent increases to more than 3xULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients receiving ZOCOR in clinical studies. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have occurred with ZOCOR. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase have also been reported. In Study 4S, with a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 1,986 adult patients were treated with ZOCOR 20 mg once daily, of whom 37% titrated to 40 mg once daily. The percentage of patients with one or more occurrences of transaminase elevations to >3xULN was 0.7% in patients taking ZOCOR compared with 0.6% in patients taking placebo. Elevated transaminases leading to discontinuation of study treatment occurred in 0.4% of patients taking ZOCOR and 0.2% of patients taking placebo. The majority of elevated transaminases leading to treatment discontinuation occurred within in the first year. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia In a 48-week clinical study in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older (43% female, 97.7% Caucasians, 1.7% Hispanics, 0.6% Multiracial) with HeFH (n=175), treated with placebo or ZOCOR (10-40 mg daily), the most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory infection, headache, abdominal pain, and nausea [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14) ] 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ZOCOR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as whole: fever, chills, malaise, asthenia Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, eosinophilia Gastrointestinal Disorders: pancreatitis, vomiting Hepatic and Pancreatic Disorders: hepatitis/jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity syndrome including: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, dermatomyositis, vasculitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: muscle cramps, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, polymyalgia rheumatica, arthritis Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, depression, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy. Rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. Cognitive impairment was generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: pruritus, alopecia, a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails), purpura, lichen planus, urticaria, photosensitivity, flushing, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome Respiratory and Thoracic: interstitial lung disease, dyspnea Reproductive System Disorders: erectile dysfunction"
