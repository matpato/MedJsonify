    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Scopolamine transdermal system is indicated in adults for prevention of: • nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness • post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) associated with recovery from anesthesia and/or opiate analgesia and surgery . Scopolamine transdermal system is an anticholinergic indicated in adults for the prevention of: • nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness. ( 1 ) • post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) associated with recovery from anesthesia and/or opiate analgesia and surgery. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Scopolamine transdermal system is contraindicated in patients with: • angle closure glaucoma. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] • hypersensitivity to scopolamine or other belladonna alkaloids or to any ingredient or component in the formulation or delivery system. Reactions have included rash generalized and erythema [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 ), Description ( 11 )] • Angle closure glaucoma ( 4 , 6.2 ) • Hypersensitivity to scopolamine or to other belladonna alkaloids or to any ingredient or component of the formulation or delivery system. ( 4 , 7 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma :  Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) • Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions :  May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) • Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women :  Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) • Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders :  Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) • Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms :  Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) • Blurred Vision :  Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) • Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns :  Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects 6.2 )] [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 )] Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients 8.5 )] [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 7.1 )] 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 7.2 )] 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 )] 5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: • Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] • Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] • Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] • Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] • Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] • Blurred Vision [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] • MRI Skin Burns [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Most common adverse reactions are: • Motion Sickness (>15%):  dry mouth, drowsiness, blurred vision and dilation of the pupils. ( 6.1 ) • PONV (≥ 3%):  dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, agitation, visual impairment, confusion, mydriasis and pharyngitis. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Motion Sickness The most common adverse reaction (approximately two thirds) was dry mouth. Less common adverse reactions, included drowsiness (less than one sixth), blurred vision and dilation of the pupils. PONV Common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 3% of patients in PONV clinical trials are shown in Table 1.
