    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE RESTASIS MULTIDOSE ® ophthalmic emulsion is indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Increased tear production was not seen in patients currently taking topical anti-inflammatory drugs or using punctal plugs. RESTASIS MULTIDOSE is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Increased tear production was not seen in patients currently taking topical anti-inflammatory drugs or using punctal plugs. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS RESTASIS MULTIDOSE is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the formulation [ see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Hypersensitivity ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS To avoid the potential for eye injury and contamination, be careful not to touch the bottle tip to your eye or other surfaces. ( 5.1 ) 5. 1 Potential for Eye Injury and Contamination Be careful not to touch the bottle tip to your eye or other surfaces to avoid potential for eye injury and contamination. 5.2 Use with Contact Lenses RESTASIS MULTIDOSE should not be administered while wearing contact lenses. Patients with decreased tear production typically should not wear contact lenses. If contact lenses are worn, they should be removed prior to the administration of the emulsion. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of RESTASIS MULTIDOSE ophthalmic emulsion.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Potential for Eye Injury and Contamination [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most common adverse reaction following the use of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% was ocular burning (17%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reaction following the use of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, 0.05% was ocular burning (17%). Other reactions reported in 1% to 5% of patients included conjunctival hyperemia, discharge, epiphora, eye pain, foreign body sensation, pruritus, stinging, and visual disturbance (most often blurring). 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, 0.05%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Reported reactions have included: hypersensitivity (including eye swelling, urticaria, rare cases of severe angioedema, face swelling, tongue swelling, pharyngeal edema, and dyspnea); and superficial injury of the eye (from the bottle tip touching the eye during administration)."
