Known hypersensitivity to dimethyl fumarate or any of the excipients of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis and      angioedema:      Discontinue      and do not restart dimethyl      fumarate delayed-release capsules if      these occur.      ( 5.1 ) Progressive      multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML):      Withhold      dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules at      the first sign or symptom      suggestive of      PML. ( 5.2 ) Herpes zoster and other serious opportunistic      infections: Consider withholding dimethyl fumarate delayed-release      capsules in cases of serious infection until the infection has resolved.      ( 5.3 ) Lymphopenia:      Obtain a      CBC including lymphocyte      count before initiating dimethyl      fumarate delayed-release capsules,      after      6 months,      and every 6 to      12 months thereafter.      Consider interruption of dimethyl      fumarate delayed-release capsules      if lymphocyte counts      <0.5 x 10 9 /L persist      for more      than six months. ( 5.4 ) Liver injury: Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline      phosphatase, and total bilirubin      levels before initiating dimethyl      fumarate delayed-release capsules and      during treatment, as clinically      indicated. Discontinue dimethyl      fumarate delayed-release capsules if clinically      significant      liver injury      induced by dimethyl      fumarate delayed-release capsules      is suspected. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Anaphylaxis and Angioedema Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules can cause anaphylaxis and angioedema after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Signs and symptoms have included difficulty breathing, urticaria, and swelling of the throat and tongue. Patients should be instructed to discontinue dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and seek immediate medical care should they experience signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema. 5.2 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has occurred in patients with MS treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules.  PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability.   A fatal case of PML occurred in a patient who received dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules for 4 years while enrolled in a clinical trial. During the clinical trial, the patient experienced prolonged lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts predominantly <0.5x10 9 /L for 3.5 years) while taking dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules [see Warnings and Precautions ( .  The patient had no other identified systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function and had not previously been treated with natalizumab, which has a known association with PML. The patient was also not taking any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications concomitantly. 5.4 )] PML has also occurred in the postmarketing setting in the presence of lymphopenia (<0.9x10 9 /L). While the role of lymphopenia in these cases is uncertain, the PML cases have occurred predominantly in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8x10 9 /L persisting for more than 6 months. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Cases of PML, diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML, have been reported in patients treated with other MS medications associated with PML. Many of these patients subsequently became symptomatic with PML. Therefore, monitoring with MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be useful, and any suspicious findings should lead to further investigation to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported following discontinuation of another MS medication associated with PML in patients with PML who were initially asymptomatic compared to patients with PML who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis. It is not known whether these differences are due to early detection and discontinuation of MS treatment or due to differences in disease in these patients. 5.3 Herpes Zoster and Other Serious Opportunistic Infections Serious cases of herpes zoster have occurred with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules, including disseminated herpes zoster, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, herpes zoster meningoencephalitis, and herpes zoster meningomyelitis. These events may occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients on dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules for signs and symptoms of herpes zoster. If herpes zoster occurs, appropriate treatment for herpes zoster should be administered. Other serious opportunistic infections have occurred with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules, including cases of serious viral (herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, cytomegalovirus), fungal (Candida and Aspergillus), and bacterial (Nocardia, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) infections. These infections have been reported in patients with reduced absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) as well as in patients with normal ALC. These infections have affected the brain, meninges, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, skin, eye, and ear. Patients with symptoms and signs consistent with any of these infections should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and receive appropriate treatment. Consider withholding dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules treatment in patients with herpes zoster or other serious infections until the infection has resolved [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.4 Lymphopenia Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules may decrease lymphocyte counts . In the MS placebo controlled trials, mean lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 30% during the first year of treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and then remained stable.  Four weeks after stopping dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules, mean lymphocyte counts increased but did not return to baseline. Six percent (6%) of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules patients and <1% of placebo patients experienced lymphocyte counts <0.5x10 9 /L (lower limit of normal 0.91x10 9 /L). The incidence of infections (60% vs. 58%) and serious infections (2% vs. 2%) was similar in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules or placebo, respectively. There was no increased incidence of serious infections observed in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8x10 9 /L or < 0.5x10 9 /L in controlled trials, although one patient in an extension study developed PML in the setting of prolonged lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts predominantly <0.5x10 9 /L for 3.5 years) [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] In controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 2% of patients experienced lymphocyte counts <0.5 x 10 9 /L for at least six months, and in this group the majority of lymphocyte counts remained <0.5x10 9 /L with continued therapy.  Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules have not been studied in patients with pre-existing low lymphocyte counts. Obtain a CBC, including lymphocyte count, before initiating treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules, 6 months after starting treatment, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated.  Consider interruption of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 x 10 9 /L persisting for more than six months.  Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules are discontinued or interrupted due to lymphopenia.  Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules should be individualized based on clinical circumstances. 5.5 Liver Injury Clinically significant cases of liver injury have been reported in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules in the postmarketing setting.  The onset has ranged from a few days to several months after initiation of treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules.  Signs and symptoms of liver injury, including elevation of serum aminotransferases to greater than 5-fold the upper limit of normal and elevation of total bilirubin to greater than 2-fold the upper limit of normal have been observed.  These abnormalities resolved upon treatment discontinuation. Some cases required hospitalization.  None of the reported cases resulted in liver failure, liver transplant, or death. However, the combination of new serum aminotransferase elevations with increased levels of bilirubin caused by drug-induced hepatocellular injury is an important predictor of serious liver injury that may lead to acute liver failure, liver transplant, or death in some patients. Elevations of hepatic transaminases (most no greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal) were observed during controlled trials [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Obtain serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin levels prior to treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and during treatment, as clinically indicated.  Discontinue dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules if clinically significant liver injury induced by dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules is suspected. 5.6 Flushing Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules may cause flushing (e.g., warmth, redness, itching, and/or burning sensation). In clinical trials, 40% of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules treated patients experienced flushing. Flushing symptoms generally began soon after initiating dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and usually improved or resolved over time. In the majority of patients who experienced flushing, it was mild or moderate in severity. Three percent (3%) of patients discontinued dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules for flushing and <1% had serious flushing symptoms that were not life-threatening but led to hospitalization. Administration of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules with food may reduce the incidence of flushing. Alternatively, administration of non-enteric coated aspirin (up to a dose of 325 mg) 30 minutes prior to dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules dosing may reduce the incidence or severity of flushing [see Dosing and Administration ( . 2.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Anaphylaxis      and Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Progressive      multifocal leukoencephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Herpes Zoster      and Other Serious Opportunistic Infections [see Warnings and      Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Lymphopenia [see      Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Liver Injury [see      Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Flushing [see      Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10% and ≥2% placebo) were flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10% and ≥2% more than placebo) for dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules were flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials In the two well-controlled studies demonstrating effectiveness, 1529 patients received dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules with an overall exposure of 2244 person-years [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The adverse reactions presented in the table below are based on safety information from 769 patients treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules 240 mg twice a day and 771 placebo-treated patients. Table 1 Adverse Reactions in Study 1 and 2 reported for Dimethyl Fumarate Delayed-release Capsules 240 mg BID at ≥ 2% higher incidence than placebo Dimethyl Fumarate Delayed-release Capsules Placebo N=769 N=771 % % Flushing 40 6 Abdominal pain 18 10 Diarrhea 14 11 Nausea 12 9 Vomiting 9 5 Pruritus 8 4 Rash 8 3 Albumin urine present 6 4 Erythema 5 1 Dyspepsia 5 3 Aspartate aminotransferase increased 4 2 Lymphopenia 2 <1 Gastrointestinal Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules caused GI events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia). The incidence of GI events was higher early in the course of treatment (primarily in month 1) and usually decreased over time in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules compared with placebo. Four percent (4%) of patients treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and less than 1% of placebo patients discontinued due to gastrointestinal events. The incidence of serious GI events was 1% in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules. Hepatic Transaminases An increased incidence of elevations of hepatic transaminases in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules was seen primarily during the first six months of treatment, and most patients with elevations had levels < 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) during controlled trials. Elevations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase to ≥ 3 times the ULN occurred in a small number of patients treated with both dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and placebo and were balanced between groups. There were no elevations in transaminases ≥ 3 times the ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times the ULN. Discontinuations due to elevated hepatic transaminases were < 1% and were similar in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules or placebo. Eosinophilia A transient increase in mean eosinophil counts was seen during the first 2 months of therapy. Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled and Uncontrolled Studies In placebo-controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, a total of 2513 patients have received dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules and been followed for periods up to 4 years with an overall exposure of 4603 person-years. Approximately 1162 patients have received more than 2 years of treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules. The adverse reaction profile of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules in the uncontrolled clinical studies was consistent with the experience in the placebo-controlled clinical trials. 6.2 Post marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Liver function abnormalities (elevations in transaminases ≥ 3 times ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times ULN) have been reported following dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules administration in postmarketing experience [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Herpes zoster infection and other serious opportunistic infections have has been reported with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules administration in postmarketing experience [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] Rhinorrhea has been reported with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules administration in post marketing experience."
