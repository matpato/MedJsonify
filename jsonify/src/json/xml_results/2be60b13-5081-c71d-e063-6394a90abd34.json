    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution is indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adult patients. Pediatric use information is approved for Braintree Laboratories, Inc.’s SUPREP BOWEL PREP KIT (sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate) oral solution. However, due to Braintree Laboratories, Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution is an osmotic laxative indicated for cleansing of the colon in preparation for colonoscopy in adult patients. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution is contraindicated in the following conditions: • Gastrointestinal obstruction or ileus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Bowel perforation [see Warnings and Precaution (5.6) ] • Toxic colitis or toxic megacolon • Gastric retention • Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution • Gastrointestinal obstruction or ileus ( 4 , 5.6 ) •       Bowel perforation ( 4 , 5.6 ) • Toxic colitis or toxic megacolon ( 4 ) • Gastric retention ( 4 ) • Hypersensitivity to any ingredient ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities: Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after each use. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) • Cardiac arrhythmias: Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) • Seizures: Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizures, including medications that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) • Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function: Use caution, ensure adequate hydration and consider laboratory testing. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) • Suspected GI obstruction or perforation: Rule out the diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.6 ) • Patients at risk for aspiration: Observe during administration. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise all patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration after taking sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN). Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution can cause temporary elevations in uric acid [see Uric acid fluctuations in patients with gout may precipitate an acute flare. The potential for uric acid elevation should be considered before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution to patients with gout or other disorders of uric acid metabolism. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1 )]. 5.4 Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury Use sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution with caution in patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see These patients may be at risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration with sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution and consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations, and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution may increase these risks [see Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. 5.6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution [see Contraindications (4) ]. Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. 5.7 Aspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex or other swallowing abnormalities are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Observe these patients during administration of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution. Use with caution in these patients.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions for bowel preparations are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Cardiac Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Use in Patients with Risk of Renal Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Colonic Mucosal Ulceration and Ischemic Colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Aspiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Most common adverse reactions are: • Adults (>2%): overall discomfort, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Adults The safety of sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution was evaluated in a multi-center, randomized, active controlled trial in 379 adult patients undergoing colonoscopy [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 1 shows the most common adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients receiving sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate oral solution or the control (a bowel prep containing polyethylene glycol and electrolytes (PEG + E)) administered in split-dose (2-day) regimens.
