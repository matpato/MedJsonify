    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP is an effective alkalinizing agent. It is useful in those conditions where long-term maintenance of an alkaline urine is desirable, and is of value in the alleviation of chronic metabolic acidosis, such as results from chronic renal insufficiency or the syndrome of renal tubular acidosis, especially when the administration of potassium salts is undesirable or contraindicated. This product is also useful for buffering and neutralizing gastric hydrochloric acid quickly and effectively. Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP is concentrated, and when administered after meals and before bedtime, allows one to maintain an alkaline urinary pH around the clock, usually without the necessity of a 2 A.M. dose. This product alkalinizes the urine without producing a systemic alkalosis in the recommended dosage. This product is highly palatable, pleasant tasting, and tolerable, even when administered for long periods.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Patients on sodium-restricted diets or with severe renal impairment.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "PRECAUTIONS Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP should be used with caution by patients with low urinary output unless under the supervision of a physician. This product should not be administered concurrently with aluminum-based antacids. Patients should be directed to dilute adequately with water and preferably, to take each dose after meals to avoid saline laxative effect. Sodium salts should be used cautiously in patients with cardiac failure, hypertension, impaired renal function, peripheral and pulmonary edema, and toxemia of pregnancy. Periodic examinations and determinations of serum electrolytes, particularly serum bicarbonate level, should be carried out in those patients with renal disease in order to avoid these complications.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Sodium citrate and citric acid oral solution on is generally well tolerated, without any unpleasant side eff ects, when given in recommended doses to patients with normal renal function on and urinary output. However, as with any alkalinizing agent, caution on must be used in certain patients with abnormal renal mechanisms to avoid development of alkalosis, especially in the presence of hypocalcemia. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Kesin Pharma at 1-833-537-4679 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."
