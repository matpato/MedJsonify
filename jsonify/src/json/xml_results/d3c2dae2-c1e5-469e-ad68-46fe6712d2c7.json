    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Diltiazem Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is a non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker indicated for the following: • Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. ( 1.1) • Rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) to sinus rhythm. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Atrial Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter Diltiazem Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is indicated in adults for the temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 1.2 Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia Diltiazem Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is indicated in adults for rapid conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (PSVT) to sinus rhythm.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Diltiazem Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in the following situations: • Patients with sick sinus syndrome or second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker. • Patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock. • Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug. • Concomitant administration with IV beta-blockers. • Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome. • Patients with ventricular tachycardia. • Sick sinus syndrome or second- or third-degree AV block with no functioning ventricular pacemaker. ( 4 ) • Severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock. ( 4 ) • Demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug. ( 4 ) • Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW).  ( 4 ) • Ventricular tachycardia. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. ( 5.2 ) • Second-or third-degree AV block. ( 5.3 ) • Heart failure. ( 5.4 ) • Hypotension. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Tachycardia and Hypotension in patients with AF/AFL and accessory bypass tract Diltiazem may cause ventricular fibrillation if given to patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome. Distinguish atrial fibrillation with aberrancy (bundle branch block) from pre-excited atrial fibrillation prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications (4)] . 5.2 Hemodynamic Deterioration in Patients with Wide Complex Tachycardia Diltiazem may cause hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation if administered to patients with wide complex tachycardia of ventricular origin. Distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to diltiazem administration [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.3 AV Block Diltiazem prolongs AV nodal conduction and refractoriness that may cause second- or third-degree AV block in sinus rhythm. Concomitant use of diltiazem with agents known to affect cardiac conduction may result in additive effects [see Drug Interactions ( . If high-degree AV block occurs in sinus rhythm, discontinue diltiazem and institute appropriate supportive measures 7 )] [see Overdosage ( 10 )]. 5.4 Heart Failure Diltiazem is a negative inotrope and can cause decreased systolic function and heart failure.  Do not initiate in patients with acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock. If heart failure develops during diltiazem treatment, discontinue treatment and treat heart failure appropriately. 5.5 Hypotension Diltiazem can cause symptomatic hypotension. Patients with low blood pressure at baseline and those on concomitant medications that decrease blood pressure, intravascular volume, or myocardial contractility are at increased risk for hypotension.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reaction rates are based on the use of diltiazem hydrochloride injection in over 400 domestic clinical trial patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter or PSVT under double-blind or open-label conditions. Hypotension was the most commonly reported adverse event during clinical trials, with symptomatic hypotension occurring in 3.2% of patients. Other events reported in a least 1% of the diltiazem-treated patients were injection site reactions (e.g., itching, burning) - 3.9%, vasodilation (flushing) - 1.7%, and arrhythmia (junctional rhythm or isorhythmic dissociation) - 1%. In addition, the following events were reported infrequently (less than 1%): Gastrointestinal - Constipation, elevated SGOT or alkaline phosphatase, nausea, vomiting Nervous System - Dizziness Other - dyspnea, edema, headache, Although not observed in clinical trials with diltiazem hydrochloride injection, the following events associated with oral diltiazem may occur: Dermatologic - Erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), exfoliative dermatitis, petechiae, photosensitivity, purpura, pruritus, rash, urticaria, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Gastrointestinal - Anorexia, dysgeusia, dyspepsia Other - Allergic reactions, angioedema (including facial or periorbital edema), gingival hyperplasia, hyperglycemia, impotence. Most common adverse reactions are hypotension, itching and burning at injection site, vasodilation, and arrhythmia.
