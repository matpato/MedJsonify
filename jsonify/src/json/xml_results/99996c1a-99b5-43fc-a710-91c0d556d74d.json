    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Intravenous solutions containing dextrose and sodium chloride are indicated for parenteral replenishment of fluid, minimal carbohydrate calories, and sodium chloride as required by the clinical condition of the patient.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS None known.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention. Excessive administration of potassium-free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia. In patients with diminished renal function, administration of solutions containing sodium ions may result in sodium retention. The intravenous administration of these solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions.PRECAUTIONS Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus. Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids, especially those containing sodium ions to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin. Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with dextrose or sodium chloride. It is also not known whether dextrose or sodium chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Dextrose or sodium chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Pediatric Use. The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations. In neonates or very small infants, the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance. Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients, particularly neonates and low birth weight infants. In very low birth weight infants, excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible intracerebral hemorrhage. Geriatric Use. An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Sodium ions are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia. If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary."
