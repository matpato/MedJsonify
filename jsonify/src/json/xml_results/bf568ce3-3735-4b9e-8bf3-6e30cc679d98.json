    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Seizure occurred in 0.6% of patients receiving XTANDI. In patients with predisposing factors, seizures were reported in 2.2% of patients. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. ( 5.1 ) • Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES): Discontinue XTANDI. ( 5.2 ) • Hypersensitivity: Discontinue XTANDI. ( 5.3 ) • Ischemic Heart Disease: Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 adverse reactions ( 5.4 ) • Falls and Fractures: Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk, and treat patients with bone-targeted agents according to established guidelines. ( 5.5 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) • Severe Dysphagia or Choking Related to Product Size: Consider using smaller XTANDI tablet(s) in patients who have difficulty swallowing. Discontinue XTANDI for patients who cannot swallow capsules or tablets. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) 5.1 Seizure Seizure occurred in 0.6% of patients receiving XTANDI in eight randomized clinical trials. In these trials, patients with predisposing factors for seizure were generally excluded. Seizure occurred from 13 to 2250 days after initiation of XTANDI. Patients experiencing seizure were permanently discontinued from therapy, and all seizure events resolved. In a single-arm trial designed to assess the risk of seizure in patients with pre-disposing factors for seizure, 8 of 366 (2.2%) XTANDI-treated patients experienced a seizure. Three of the 8 patients experienced a second seizure during continued treatment with XTANDI after their first seizure resolved. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI. Patients in the study had one or more of the following pre-disposing factors: the use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold (~ 54%), history of traumatic brain or head injury (~ 28%), history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack (~ 24%), and Alzheimer’s disease, meningioma, or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer, unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months, past history of seizure, presence of a space occupying lesion of the brain, history of arteriovenous malformation, or history of brain infection (all < 5%). Approximately 17% of patients had more than one risk factor. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while receiving XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others. Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. 5.2 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) There have been reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in patients receiving XTANDI [see . PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES. Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] 5.3 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including edema of the face (0.5%), tongue (0.1%), or lip (0.1%) have been observed with enzalutamide in eight randomized clinical trials. Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post-marketing cases. Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care. Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions. 5.4 Ischemic Heart Disease In the combined data of five randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm (3.5% vs 2%). Grade 3-4 ischemic events occurred in 1.8% of patients on the XTANDI arm compared to 1.1% on the placebo arm. Ischemic events led to death in 0.4% of patients on the XTANDI arm compared to 0.1% on the placebo arm. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3-4 ischemic heart disease. 5.5 Falls and Fractures Falls and fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI. Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents. In the combined data of five randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, falls occurred in 12% of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 6% of patients treated with placebo. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure. Fractures occurred in 13% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 6% of patients treated with placebo. Grade 3-4 fractures occurred in 3.4% of patients treated with XTANDI and in 1.9% of patients treated with placebo. The median time to onset of fracture was 420 days (range: 1 to 2348 days) for patients treated with XTANDI. Routine bone density assessment and treatment of osteoporosis with bone-targeted agents were not performed in the studies. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females. Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action, XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] 5.7 Dysphagia or Choking Severe dysphagia or choking, including events that could be life-threatening requiring medical intervention or fatal, can occur due to XTANDI product size. Advise patients to take each capsule or tablet whole with a sufficient amount of water to ensure that all medication is successfully swallowed. Consider use of a smaller tablet size of XTANDI in patients who have difficulty swallowing. Discontinue XTANDI for patients who cannot swallow capsules or tablets.",

The data in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS reflect eight randomized, controlled trials [AFFIRM, PREVAIL, TERRAIN, PROSPER, ARCHES, EMBARK, Asian PREVAIL (NCT02294461), and STRIVE (NCT01664923)] that were pooled to conduct safety analyses in patients with CRPC (N = 3651), mCSPC (N = 752), or nmCSPC with high‑risk BCR (N = 707) treated with XTANDI. Patients received XTANDI 160 mg (N = 5110) or placebo orally once daily (N = 2829) or bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily (N = 387). In these eight trials, the median duration of treatment was 22.1 months (range: < 0.1 to 95.0) in patients that received XTANDI. In five placebo-controlled trials (AFFIRM, PROSPER, PREVAIL, ARCHES, and EMBARK), the median duration of treatment was 19.4 months (range: < 0.1 to 90.4) in the XTANDI group [see In these five trials, the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) that occurred more frequently (≥ 2% over placebo) in the XTANDI-treated patients were musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, hot flush, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hypertension, hemorrhage, fall, fracture and headache. Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. AFFIRM: XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy AFFIRM enrolled 1199 patients with metastatic CRPC who had previously received docetaxel. The median duration of treatment was 8.3 months with XTANDI and 3.0 months with placebo. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids. Grade 3 and higher adverse reactions were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 0.9% of the XTANDI-treated patients compared to none (0%) of the placebo-treated patients. Table 1 shows adverse reactions reported in AFFIRM that occurred at a ≥ 2% higher frequency in the XTANDI arm compared to the placebo arm. Table 1.

Patients were randomized 2:1 and received either XTANDI at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 930) or placebo (N = 465). The median duration of treatment at the time of analysis was 18.4 months (range: 0.0 to 42 months) with XTANDI and 11.1 months (range: 0.0 to 43 months) with placebo. Overall, 32 patients (3.4%) receiving XTANDI died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death with ≥ 2 patients included coronary artery disorders (n = 7), sudden death (n = 2), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 2), general physical health deterioration (n = 2), stroke (n = 2), and secondary malignancy (n = 5; one each of acute myeloid leukemia, brain neoplasm, mesothelioma, small cell lung cancer, and malignant neoplasm of unknown primary site). Three patients (0.6%) receiving placebo died from adverse reactions of cardiac arrest (n = 1), left ventricular failure (n = 1), and pancreatic carcinoma (n = 1). Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported among 31% of XTANDI-treated patients and 23% of placebo‑treated patients. Discontinuations with an adverse reaction as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI-treated patients and 6% of placebo-treated patients. Of these, the most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was fatigue, which occurred in 1.6% of the XTANDI-treated patients compared to none of the placebo-treated patients.

All patients received either a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or had bilateral orchiectomy. Patients received either XTANDI at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 572) or placebo (N = 574). The median duration of treatment was 12.8 months (range: 0.2 to 26.6 months) with XTANDI and 11.6 months (range: 0.2 to 24.6 months) with placebo. Overall, 10 patients (1.7%) receiving XTANDI died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death in ≥ 2 patients included heart disease (n = 3), sepsis (n = 2) and pulmonary embolism (n = 2). Eight patients (1.4%) receiving placebo died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death in ≥ 2 patients included heart disease (n = 2) and sudden death (n = 2). Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in 24% of patients treated with XTANDI. Permanent discontinuation due to adverse reactions as the primary reason was reported in 4.9% of XTANDI-treated patients and 3.7% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in XTANDI-treated patients were alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, and seizure, each in 0.3%. The most common adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in placebo-treated patients were arthralgia, and fatigue, each in 0.3%. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4.4% of patients who received XTANDI. Fatigue/asthenia was the most frequent adverse reaction requiring dose reduction in 2.1% of XTANDI-treated patients and 0.7% of placebo-treated patients.

The reason for death in ≥ 2 patients receiving XTANDI plus leuprolide was infection (n = 2), and the reason for death in ≥ 2 patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent was arterial thromboembolism (n=2). Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions during the total duration of treatment were reported in 46% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 50% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 43% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide. Permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions during the total duration of treatment as the primary reason was reported in 21% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 18% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 10% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation included fatigue (3.4% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 3.7% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 1.4% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide), hot flush (2% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 0% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 1.1% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide), nausea (1.1% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 0.6% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 0.3% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide), and cognitive disorder (1.1% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 1.4% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7% of patients who received XTANDI plus leuprolide, 16% of patients who received XTANDI as a single agent, and 4.5% of patients who received placebo plus leuprolide. Fatigue was the most frequent adverse reaction requiring dose reduction in 3.1% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 10% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 1.7% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide.

Laboratory Abnormalities XTANDI (N = 3526) Placebo (N = 2636) Grade 1-4 (%) Grade 3-4 (%) Grade 1-4 (%) Grade 3-4 (%) Hematology Hemoglobin decreased 50 1.8 47 1.5 Neutrophil count decreased 20 1 17 0.5 White blood cell decreased 18 0.5 11 0.2 Chemistry Hyperglycemia 86 3.7 78 4.3 Hypermagnesemia 17 0.1 14 0.3 Hyponatremia 14 1.6 9 1.4 Hypophosphatemia 10 1.4 7 0.8 Hypercalcemia 8 0.1 5 0.1 Hypertension In the combined data from five randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, hypertension was reported in 14% of patients receiving XTANDI and 7% of patients receiving placebo. Medical history of hypertension was balanced between arms. Hypertension led to study discontinuation in < 1% of patients in each arm. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of XTANDI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders: vomiting, dysphagia (including choking related to XTANDI product size) Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity (edema of the face, tongue, lip, or pharynx) Neurological Disorders: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), dysgeusia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP))"
