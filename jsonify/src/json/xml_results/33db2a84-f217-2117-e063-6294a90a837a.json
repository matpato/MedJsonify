    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metaxalone is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults and pediatric patients 13 years of age and older. Metaxalone is a muscle relaxant indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults and pediatric patients 13 years of age and older.

    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Metaxalone is contraindicated in patients with: Known hypersensitivity to any component of metaxalone. Known tendency to drug induced, hemolytic, or other anemias. Severe renal or hepatic impairment. Known hypersensitivity to any components of this product. ( 4 ) Known tendency to drug induced, hemolytic, or other anemias. ( 4 ) Severe renal or hepatic impairment. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. ( 5.1 , 7.1 ) Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression : Metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 5.1 Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug taken at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage 7 )] [see Overdosage ( . 10 )] Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days after initiation of a serotonergic drug, but may occur later than that. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another serotoneric drug is warranted, reassess the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected or it occurs. 5.2 Central Nervous System Depression Because of its central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects, metaxalone may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, especially when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol. Geriatric patients may be especially susceptible to CNS depression associated with metaxalone use. When used concomitantly, the sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] Follow metaxalone-treated patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use of metaxalone and another CNS depressant is warranted, closely monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of metaxalone were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequent reactions to metaxalone were: CNS: drowsiness, dizziness, headache, and nervousness or \"irritability\". Digestive: nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset. Other adverse reactions were: CNS: cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during concomitant use of metaxalone (within the recommended dosage range) and other serotonergic drugs and with the use of metaxalone as the only serotonergic drug at a dosage higher than the recommended dosage [see Warnings and Precautions ( , 5.1 ) Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Overdosage ( . 10 )] Hematologic: leukopenia; hemolytic anemia; Hepatobiliary: jaundice; Immune System: anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction, rash with or without pruritus. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea and vomiting.
