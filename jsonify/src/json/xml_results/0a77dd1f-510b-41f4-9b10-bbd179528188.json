    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin hydrochloride tablets are biguanide indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with: • Severe renal impairment (eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) [ ]. see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) • Hypersensitivity to metformin. • Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. • Severe renal impairment (eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) ( 4 , 5.1 ) • Hypersensitivity to metformin ( 4 ) • Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Lactic Acidosis: See boxed warning. ( 5.1 ) • Vitamin B Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 12 Deficiency: 5.2 ) • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin‑ associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: • Renal impairment — The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include [ : see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency In metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: • Lactic Acidosis [ ]. see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) • Vitamin B12                Deficiency [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. • Hypoglycemia [ see  Warnings and Precautions (5.3) For metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Granules Pharmaceuticals Inc at 1-877-770-3183 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets In a U.S. clinical trial of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets up to 2550 mg per day. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients and that were more common than in placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions from a Clinical Trial of Metformin Hydrochloride TabletsOccurring >5% and More Common than Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets (n=141) Placebo (n=145) Diarrhea 53% 12% Nausea/Vomiting 26% 8% Flatulence 12% 6% Asthenia 9% 6% Indigestion 7% 4% Abdominal Discomfort 6% 5% Headache 6% 5% Diarrhea led to discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets in 6% of patients. Additionally, the following adverse reactions were reported in ≥1 % to ≤5% of metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients and were more commonly reported with metformin hydrochloride tablets than placebo: abnormal stools, hypoglycemia, myalgia, lightheaded, dyspnea, nail disorder, rash, sweating increased, taste disorder, chest discomfort, chills, flu syndrome, flushing, palpitation. In metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Pediatric Patients In clinical trials with metformin hydrochloride tablets in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the profile of adverse reactions was similar to that observed in adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin."
