    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE IMPORTANT NOTICE: Oxytocin Injection, USP (synthetic) is indicated for the medical rather than the elective induction of labor. Available data and information are inadequate to define the benefits to risks considerations in the use of the drug product for elective induction. Elective induction of labor is defined as the initiation of labor for convenience in an individual with a term pregnancy who is free of medical indications. Antepartum Oxytocin injection (synthetic) is indicated for the initiation or improvement of uterine contractions, where this is desirable and considered suitable, in order to achieve early vaginal delivery for fetal or maternal reasons. It is indicated for (1) induction of labor in patients with a medical indication for the initiation of labor, such as Rh problems, maternal diabetes, pre-eclampsia at or near term, when delivery is in the best interest of mother and fetus or when membranes are prematurely ruptured and delivery is indicated; (2) stimulation or reinforcement of labor, as in selected cases of uterine inertia; (3) adjunctive therapy in the management of incomplete or inevitable abortion. In the first trimester, curettage is generally considered primary therapy. In second trimester abortion, oxytocin infusion will often be successful in emptying the uterus. Other means of therapy, however, may be required in such cases. Postpartum Oxytocin injection (synthetic) is indicated to produce uterine contractions during the third stage of labor and to control postpartum bleeding or hemorrhage.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Oxytocin injection (synthetic) is contraindicated in any of the following conditions: • Significant cephalopelvic disproportion; • Unfavorable fetal positions or presentations which are undeliverable without conversion prior to delivery, i.e., transverse lies; • In obstetrical emergencies where the benefit-to-risk ratio for either the fetus or the mother favors surgical intervention; • In cases of fetal distress where delivery is not imminent; • Prolonged use in uterine inertia or severe toxemia; • Hypertonic uterine patterns; • Patients with hypersensitivity to the drug; • Induction or augmentation of labor in those cases where vaginal delivery is contraindicated, such as cord presentation or prolapse, total placenta previa, and vasa previa.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Oxytocin injection (synthetic) when given for induction or stimulation of labor, must be administered only by the intravenous route and with adequate medical supervision in a hospital.PRECAUTIONS General All patients receiving intravenous oxytocin must be under continuous observation by trained personnel with a thorough knowledge of the drug and qualified to identify complications. A physician qualified to manage any complications should be immediately available. When properly administered, oxytocin should stimulate uterine contractions similar to those seen in normal labor. Overstimulation of the uterus by improper administration can be hazardous to both mother and fetus. Even with proper administration and adequate supervision, hypertonic contractions can occur in patients whose uteri are hypersensitive to oxytocin. Except in unusual circumstances, oxytocin should not be administered in the following conditions: prematurity, borderline cephalopelvic disproportion, previous major surgery on the cervix or uterus including Caesarean section, overdistention of the uterus, grand multiparity or invasive cervical carcinoma. Because of the variability of the combinations of factors which may be present in the conditions above, the definition of ‘‘unusual circumstances’’ must be left to the judgement of the physician. The decision can only be made by carefully weighing the potential benefits which oxytocin can provide in a given case against rare but definite potential for the drug to produce hypertonicity or tetanic spasm. Maternal deaths due to hypertensive episodes, subarachnoid hemorrhage, rupture of the uterus and fetal deaths due to various causes have been reported associated with the use of parenteral oxytocic drugs for induction of labor and for augmentation in the first and second stages of labor. Oxytocin has been shown to have an intrinsic antidiuretic effect, acting to increase water reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate. Consideration should, therefore, be given to the possibility of water intoxication, particularly when oxytocin is administered continuously by infusion and the patient is receiving fluids by mouth. Drug Interactions Severe hypertension has been reported when oxytocin was given three to four hours following prophylactic administration of a vasoconstrictor in conjunction with caudal block anesthesia. Cyclopropane anesthesia may modify oxytocin’s cardiovascular effects, so as to produce unexpected results such as hypotension. Maternal sinus bradycardia with abnormal atrioventricular rhythms has also been noted when oxytocin was used concomitantly with cyclopropane anesthesia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There are no animal or human studies on the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of this drug, nor is there any information on its effect on fertility. Pregnancy Category C. There are no known indications for use of oxytocin in the first and second trimester of pregnancy other than in relation to spontaneous or induced abortion. Based on the wide experience with this drug and its chemical structure and pharmacological properties, it would not be expected to present a risk of fetal abnormalities when used as indicated. Nonteratogenic Effects—See in the fetus or infant. ADVERSE REACTIONS Labor and Delivery—See . INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxytocin is administered to a nursing woman.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1-800-551-7176 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following adverse reactions have been reported in the mother: • Anaphylactic reaction • Postpartum hemorrhage • Cardiac arrhythmia • Fatal afibrinogenemia • Nausea • Vomiting • Premature ventricular contractions • Pelvic hematoma Excessive dosage or hypersensitivity to the drug may result in uterine hypertonicity, spasm, tetanic contraction or rupture of the uterus. The possibility of increased blood loss and afibrinogenemia should be kept in mind when administering the drug. Severe water intoxication with convulsions and coma has occurred, and is associated with a slow oxytocin infusion over a 24-hour period. Maternal death due to oxytocin-induced water intoxication has been reported. The following adverse reactions have been reported in the fetus or infant: Due to induced uterine mobility: • Bradycardia • Premature ventricular contractions and other arrhythmias • Permanent CNS or brain damage • Fetal death Due to use of oxytocin in the mother: • Neonatal retinal hemorrhage • Low Apgar scores at five minutes • Neonatal jaundice"
