    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Adrenalin ® is a non-selective alpha and beta adrenergic agonist indicated for: Emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type 1), including anaphylaxis ( 1.1 ) To increase mean arterial blood pressure in adult patients with hypotension associated with septic shock ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Anaphylaxis Emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I), including anaphylaxis, which may result from insect stings or bites, foods, drugs, sera, diagnostic testing substances and other allergens, as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis or exercise-induced anaphylaxis. 1.2 Hypotension associated with Septic Shock Adrenalinis indicated to increase mean arterial blood pressure in adult patients with hypotension associated with septic shock.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Do not inject into buttocks, digits, hands, or feet ( 5.1 ) Avoid extravasation into tissues, which can cause local necrosis ( 5.3 ) May aggravate angina pectoris or produce ventricular arrhythmias ( 5.7 ) 5.1  Incorrect Locations of Injection for Anaphylaxis Injection into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) is the most appropriate location for administration because of its location, size, and available blood flow.  Injection into (or near) smaller muscles, such as in the deltoid, is not recommended. Do not administer repeated injections of epinephrine at the same site, as the resulting vasoconstriction may cause tissue necrosis. Do not inject into buttock. Injection into the buttock may not provide effective treatment of anaphylaxis and has been associated with the development of Clostridial infections (gas gangrene). Do not inject into digits, hands, or feet. Epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor.  Accidental injection into the digits, hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area and tissue necrosis. 5.2 Serious Infections at the Injection Site Rare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia (gas gangrene), have been reported at the injection site following epinephrine injection for anaphylaxis. Advise patients to seek medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of infection, such as persistent redness, warmth, swelling, or tenderness, at the epinephrine injection site. 5.3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis with Intravenous Infusion Avoid extravasation of epinephrine into the tissues, to prevent local necrosis. When Adrenalin is administered intravenously, check the infusion site frequently for free flow.  Blanching along the course of the infused vein, sometimes without obvious extravasation, may be attributed to vasa vasorum constriction with increased permeability of the vein wall, permitting some leakage. This also may progress on rare occasions to superficial slough. Hence, if blanching occurs, consider changing the infusion site at intervals to allow the effects of local vasoconstriction to subside. There is potential for gangrene in a lower extremity when infusions of catecholamine are given in an ankle vein. Antidote for Extravasation Ischemia: To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, infiltrate the area with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of phentolamine , an adrenergic blocking agent. Use a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle, with the solution being infiltrated liberally throughout the area, which is easily identified by its cold, hard, and pallid appearance. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.4 Hypertension Because individual response to epinephrine may vary significantly, monitor blood pressure frequently and titrate to avoid excessive increases in blood pressure. Patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline or imipramine types may experience severe, prolonged hypertension when given epinephrine. 5.5 Pulmonary Edema Epinephrine increases cardiac output and causes peripheral vasoconstriction, which may result in pulmonary edema. 5.6 Renal Impairment Epinephrine constricts renal blood vessels, which may result in oliguria or renal impairment. 5.7 Cardiac Arrhythmias and Ischemia Epinephrine may induce cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia in patients, especially patients suffering from coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathy. 5.8  Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Adrenalin contains sodium bisulfite which may cause mild to severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis or asthmatic episodes in susceptible individuals.  However, the presence of bisulfite in this product should not preclude its use for the treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations even if the patient is sulfite-sensitive, as the alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine include anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, dizziness, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea and vomiting, headache, and respiratory difficulties.  These symptoms occur in some persons receiving therapeutic doses of epinephrine, but are more likely to occur in patients with heart disease, hypertension, or hyperthyroidism [ . see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] The true incidence of adverse reactions associated with the systemic use of epinephrine is difficult to determine.  Adverse reactions reported in observational trials, case reports, and studies are listed below by body system: Cardiovascular : angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, pallor, palpitations, tachyarrhythmia, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, ventricular ectopy and stress cardiomyopathy. Rapid rises in blood pressure associated with epinephrine use have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease [ . see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Neurological : disorientation, impaired memory, panic, psychomotor agitation, sleepiness, tingling. Psychiatric : anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness. Other : Patients with Parkinson’s disease may experience psychomotor agitation or a temporary worsening of symptoms [ . see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Diabetic patients may experience transient increases in blood sugar. Injection into the buttock has resulted in cases of gas gangrene [ . see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Rare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia (gas gangrene), have been reported following epinephrine injection in the thigh [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine include anxiety, tremor, weakness, dizziness, sweating, palpitations and pallor ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Par Pharmaceutical at 1-800-828-9393 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."
