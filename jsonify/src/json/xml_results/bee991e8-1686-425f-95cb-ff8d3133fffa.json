    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate. Amlodipine Hypertension Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal’s or Variant Angina) Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40%, amlodipine is indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure. Atorvastatin Atorvastatin is indicated: • To reduce the risk of: o Myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in adults with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) but without clinically evident CHD o MI and stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with multiple risk factors for CHD but without clinically evident CHD o Non-fatal MI, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, and angina in adults with clinically evident CHD • As an adjunct to diet to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in: o Adults with primary hyperlipidemia. o Adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). • As an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies, or alone if such treatments are unavailable, to reduce LDL-C in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of adults with: o Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia o Hypertriglyceridemia Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are a combination of amlodipine besylate, a calcium channel blocker, and atorvastatin calcium, a HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor (statin), indicated in patients for whom treatment with both amlodipine and atorvastatin is appropriate ( 1 ). Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of Coronary Artery Disease ( 1 ). Atorvastatin is indicated ( 1 ): • To reduce the risk of: o Myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, revascularization procedures, and angina in adults with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) but without clinically evident CHD. o MI and stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus with multiple risk factors for CHD but without clinically evident CHD. o Non-fatal MI, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, and angina in adults with clinically evident CHD. • As an adjunct to diet to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) in: o Adults with primary hyperlipidemia. o Adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). • As an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies to reduce LDL-C in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. • As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of adults with: o Primary dysbetalipoproteinemia. o Hypertriglyceridemia.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Hypersensitivity to amlodipine, atorvastatin or any excipients in amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] • Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis ( 4 ). • Hypersensitivity to amlodipine, atorvastatin or any excipient in amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets dosage. Discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever ( 2 , 5.1 , 7.3 , 8.5 , 8.6 ). • Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets if IMNM is suspected ( 5.2 ). • Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets ( 5.3 ). • Angina or myocardial infarction may occur with initiation or dose increase ( 5.4 ). • Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, acute hypotension is unlikely ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher amlodipine and atorvastatin tablet dosage [see . Drug Interactions (7.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6) ] Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablet exposure may be increased by drug interactions due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or transporters (e.g., breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP], organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1/OATP1B3] and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), resulting in an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets is not recommended. Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablet dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain anti-viral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications [see . Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with lipid-modifying doses (> 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir Dosage and Administration (2) ] [see . Consider if the benefit of use of these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Drug Interactions (7.3) ] Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets [see . Drug Interactions (7.3) ] Discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the amlodipine and atorvastatin tablet dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG-CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin [see . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see . If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin. Contraindications (4) ] 5.4 Increased Angina and Myocardial Infarction Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the dose of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. 5.5 Hypotension Symptomatic hypotension is possible with use of amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely. 5.6 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including atorvastatin. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices. 5.7 Increased Risk of Hemorrhagic Stroke in Patients on Atorvastatin 80 mg with Recent Hemorrhagic Stroke In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial where 2365 adult patients, without CHD who had a stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) within the preceding 6 months, were treated with atorvastatin 80 mg, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p = 0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Consider the risk/benefit of use of atorvastatin 80 mg in patients with recent hemorrhagic stroke.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: • Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reaction to amlodipine is edema which occurred in a dose related manner ( 6.1 ). Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5%) are nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhea, pain in extremity, and urinary tract infection to atorvastatin ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Amlodipine and Atorvastatin Tablets Amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1092 patients in double-blind placebo-controlled studies treated for co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidemia. In general, treatment with amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets was well tolerated. For the most part, adverse reactions have been mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials with amlodipine and atorvastatin tablets, no adverse reactions peculiar to this combination have been observed. Adverse reactions are similar in terms of nature, severity, and frequency to those reported previously with amlodipine and atorvastatin. The following information is based on the clinical experience with amlodipine and atorvastatin. Amlodipine Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N = 1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N = 1250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are dizziness and edema. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows: Amlodipine Placebo N = 520 2.5 mg N = 275 5 mg N = 296 10 mg N = 268 Edema 1.8 3.0 10.8 0.6 Dizziness 1.1 3.4 3.4 1.5 Flushing 0.7 1.4 2.6 0.0 Palpitations 0.7 1.4 4.5 0.6 Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported at an incidence greater than 1.0% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following: Amlodipine (%) (N = 1730) Placebo (%) (N = 1250) Fatigue 4.5 2.8 Nausea 2.9 1.9 Abdominal Pain 1.6 0.3 Somnolence 1.4 0.6 Edema, flushing, palpitations, and somnolence appear to be more common in women than in men. The following events occurred in < 1% but > 0.1% of patients treated with amlodipine in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis. Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia. General: allergic reaction, asthenia,1 back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease. Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps,1 myalgia. Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male1 and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization. Respiratory System: dyspnea,1 epistaxis. Skin and Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus,1 rash,1 rash erythematous, rash maculopapular. Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus. Urinary System: micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased. Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst. Hemopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. 1 These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. Amlodipine therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total TG, TC, HDL-C, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. Atorvastatin In the atorvastatin placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16066 patients (8755 atorvastatin vs. 7311 placebo; age range 10-93 years, 39% female, 91% White, 3% Black or African American, 2% Asian, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, the most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). Table 2 summarizes adverse reactions, reported in ≥ 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with atorvastatin (n = 8755), from seventeen placebo-controlled trials. Table 2.

Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests Persistent elevations in serum transaminases, defined as more than 3 times the ULN and occurring on 2 or more occasions, occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver enzyme tests in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent liver enzyme elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT, [see 10,001 patients (age range 29-78 years, 19% female; 94% White, 3% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 2% other) with clinically evident CHD were treated with atorvastatin 10 mg daily (n = 5006) or atorvastatin 80 mg daily (n = 4995). In the high-dose atorvastatin group, there were more patients with serious adverse reactions (1.8%) and discontinuations due to adverse reactions (9.9%) as compared to the low-dose group (1.4%; 8.1%, respectively) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (≥ 3 x ULN twice within 4-10 days) occurred in 1.3% of individuals with atorvastatin 80 mg and in 0.2% of individuals with atorvastatin 10 mg. Elevations of CK (≥ 10 x ULN) were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin group (0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (0.1%). Clinical Studies (14.6) ] Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL, 4731 patients (age range 21-92 years, 40% female; 93% White, 3% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 3% other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months were treated with atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 2365) or placebo (n = 2366) for a median follow-up of 4.9 years. There was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations (≥ 3 x ULN twice within 4-10 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.1%). Elevations of CK (> 10 x ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 6.1% of subjects in the atorvastatin group and 3.8% of subjects in the placebo group. In a post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (9.2% vs. 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (2.3% vs. 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Patients who entered the trial with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (16% atorvastatin vs. 4% placebo). Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies of Atorvastatin in Pediatric Patients with HeFH In a 26-week controlled study in pediatric patients with HeFH (ages 10 years to 17 years) (n = 140, 31% female; 92% White, 1.6% Black or African American, 1.6% Asian, 4.8% other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg daily, as an adjunct to diet to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels, was generally similar to that of placebo [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.11) ] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of amlodipine and atorvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Amlodipine The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles. Atorvastatin Gastrointestinal Disorders: pancreatitis General Disorders: fatigue Hepatobiliary Disorders: fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis Injury: tendon rupture Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, myositis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use. Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, peripheral neuropathy. There have been rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins.
