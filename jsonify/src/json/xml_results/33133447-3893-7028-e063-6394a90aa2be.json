    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE LIKMEZ is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial indicated for Trichomoniasis in adults ( 1.1 ) Amebiasis in adults and pediatric patients ( 1.2 ) Anaerobic Bacterial Infections in adults ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of LIKMEZ and other antibacterial drugs, LIKMEZ should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria ( 1.4 ). 1.1 Trichomoniasis LIKMEZ is indicated for the treatment of: Symptomatic trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis in adult females and males when the diagnosis is confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures. Asymptomatic trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis in adult females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, treat sexual partners of patients simultaneously to prevent re-infection. 1.2 Amebiasis LIKMEZ is indicated for the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amoebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess in adults and pediatric patients. In amebic liver abscess, treatment with LIKMEZ does not obviate the need for aspiration or drainage of pus. 1.3 Anaerobic Bacterial Infections LIKMEZ is indicated in the treatment of the following serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria in adults: Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and liver abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group ( B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus ), Parabacteroides distasonis, Clostridium species, Eubacterium species, Peptococcus species, and Peptostreptococcus species. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species. Gynecologic infections, including endometritis, endomyometritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species. Bacterial septicemia caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group and Clostridium s pecies. Bone and joint infections, (as adjunctive therapy), caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. Central nervous system (CNS) infections, including meningitis and brain abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. Endocarditis caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with LIKMEZ therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of aerobic infection should be used in addition to LIKMEZ. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of LIKMEZ and other antibacterial drugs, LIKMEZ should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Prior history of hypersensitivity to metronidazole  or other nitroimidazole derivatives ( 4.1 ) Patients who have used disulfiram within the last two weeks. ( 4.2 , 7.1 ) Patients who consume alcohol or products containing propylene glycol during and for at least three days after LIKMEZ therapy. ( 4.3 , 7.2 ) Patients with Cockayne syndrome ( 4.4 , 6.2 ) 4.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions LIKMEZ is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to metronidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives [ see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 4.2 Psychotic Reactions with Disulfiram LIKMEZ is contraindicated in patients who have used disulfiram within the last two weeks. Use of oral metronidazole is associated with psychotic reactions in alcoholic patients who were using disulfiram concurrently [ see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] 4.3 Interaction with Alcohol LIKMEZ is contraindicated in patients who consume alcohol or products containing propylene glycol during and for at least three days after LIKMEZ therapy. Use of oral metronidazole is associated with a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, including abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing [ see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 4.4 Cockayne Syndrome LIKMEZ is contraindicated in patients with Cockayne syndrome. Severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure with fatal outcomes have been reported after initiation of metronidazole in patients with Cockayne syndrome [ see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with metronidazole. If symptoms or signs of SCARs develop, discontinue LIKMEZ immediately and institute appropriate therapy. ( 5.2 ) Central and Peripheral Nervous System Effects: Encephalopathy, convulsive seizures, aseptic meningitis and peripheral neuropathy have been reported with metronidazole. Promptly evaluate the benefit/risk of continuation of LIKMEZ if abnormal neurological signs develop. ( 5.3 ) Blood Dyscrasias : Use LIKMEZ with care in patients with a history of blood dyscrasias. LIKMEZ may cause mild transient leukopenia. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Potential for Carcinogenicity Metronidazole has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats. Tumors affecting the liver, lungs, mammary, and lymphatic tissues have been detected in several studies of metronidazole in rats and mice, but not hamsters [ see .  Avoid unnecessary use of LIKMEZ. Reserve LIKMEZ for use in the following indications: trichomoniasis Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] [ see , amebiasis Indications and Usage (1.1) ] [ see and anaerobic bacterial infections Indications and Usage (1.2) ] [ see Indications and Usage (1.3) ]. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of metronidazole. Symptoms can be serious and potentially life threatening. If symptoms or signs of SCARs develop, discontinue LIKMEZ immediately and institute appropriate therapy. 5.3 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Effects Encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, peripheral neuropathy (including optic neuropathy) and convulsive seizures have been reported with metronidazole. Encephalopathy has been reported in association with cerebellar toxicity characterized by ataxia, dizziness, and dysarthria. CNS lesions seen on MRI have been described in reports of encephalopathy. CNS symptoms are generally reversible within days to weeks upon discontinuation of metronidazole. CNS lesions seen on MRI have also been described as reversible. Peripheral neuropathy, mainly of sensory type has been reported and is characterized by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported with metronidazole [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Symptoms may occur within hours of dose administration and generally resolve after metronidazole therapy is discontinued. The appearance of abnormal neurological signs and symptoms demands the prompt evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio of the continuation of therapy. 5.4 Fungal Superinfections Known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with LIKMEZ and requires treatment with an antifungal agent. 5.5 Blood Dyscrasias LIKMEZ is a nitroimidazole and should be used with care in patients with evidence of or history of blood dyscrasia. A mild leukopenia has been observed during metronidazole administration; however, no persistent hematologic abnormalities attributable to metronidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended before and after therapy [ see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.6 Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing LIKMEZ in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of thedevelopment of drug-resistant bacteria.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [ ] see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) Central and Peripheral Nervous System Effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Blood Dyscrasias [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 )] Common adverse reactions include nausea, headache, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, epigastric distress, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Saptalis Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-833-727-8254 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The following reactions have been reported during treatment with metronidazole: Central and Peripheral Nervous System: The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with metronidazole have been convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity.  Persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole. In addition, headache, syncope, dizziness, vertigo, incoordination, ataxia, confusion, dysarthria, irritability, depression, weakness, and insomnia have been reported. Gastrointestinal: The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract, particularly nausea, sometimes accompanied by headache, anorexia, and occasionally vomiting; diarrhea; epigastric distress; and abdominal cramping and constipation. Mouth: A sharp, unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue, glossitis, and stomatitis have occurred; these may be associated with a sudden overgrowth of Candida which may occur during therapy. Dermatologic: Erythematous rash and pruritus. Hematopoietic: Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia); reversible thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular: QT prolongation has been reported, particularly when metronidazole was administered with drugs with the potential for prolonging the QT interval. Flattening of the T‑wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Hypersensitivity: Urticaria, erythematous rash, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, flushing, nasal congestion, dryness of the mouth (or vagina or vulva), and fever. Renal: Dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, incontinence, and a sense of pelvic pressure. Instances of darkened urine have been reported by approximately one patient in 100,000. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified, it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance. Other: Proliferation of Candida in the vagina, dyspareunia, decrease of libido, proctitis, and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling “serum sickness.” Cases of pancreatitis, which generally abated on withdrawal of the drug, have been reported. Patients with Crohn’s disease are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers. There have been some reports in the medical literature of breast and colon cancer in Crohn’s disease patients who have been treated with metronidazole at high doses for extended periods of time. A cause-and-effect relationship has not been established. Crohn’s disease is not an approved indication for LIKMEZ. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of metronidazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The cases of severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure, including cases with fatal outcomes with very rapid onset after initiation of systemic use of metronidazole have been reported in patients with Cockayne syndrome (latency from drug start to signs of liver failure as short as 2 days) [ . see Contraindications (4.4) ] Central and Peripheral Nervous System: Tinnitus, hearing impairment, and hearing loss. Hypersensitivity: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) [ . see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]"
