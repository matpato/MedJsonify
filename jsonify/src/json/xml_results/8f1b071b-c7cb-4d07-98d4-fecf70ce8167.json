Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.1 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 \tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, REZUROCK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of belumosudil to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal mortality and malformations at maternal exposures (AUC) less than those in patients at the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with REZUROCK and for one week after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, are infections, asthenia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, edema, hemorrhage, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, headache, phosphate decreased, gamma glutamyl transferase increased, lymphocytes decreased, and hypertension. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Kadmon Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Chronic Graft versus Host Disease In two clinical trials (Study KD025-213 and Study KD025-208), 83 adult patients with chronic GVHD were treated with REZUROCK 200 mg once daily [see . The median duration of treatment was 9.2 months (range 0.5 to 44.7 months). Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Fatal adverse reaction was reported in one patient with severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and multi-organ failure. Permanent discontinuation of REZUROCK due to adverse reactions occurred in 18% of patients. The adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of REZUROCK in >3% of patients included nausea (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 29% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to dose interruption in ≥2% were infections (11%), diarrhea (4%), and asthenia, dyspnea, hemorrhage, hypotension, liver function test abnormal, nausea, pyrexia, edema, and renal failure with (2% each). The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were infections, asthenia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, edema, hemorrhage, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, headache, phosphate decreased, gamma glutamyl transferase increased, lymphocytes decreased, and hypertension.
