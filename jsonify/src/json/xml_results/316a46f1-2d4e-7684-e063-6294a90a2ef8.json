    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are a muscarinic antagonist indicated for the treatment of adults with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency.( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients: With urinary retention [see , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] With gastric retention [see , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] With uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [see , and Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate or the inactive ingredients in Solifenacin Succinate Tablets. Reported adverse reactions have included anaphylaxis and angioedema [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Urinary retention. ( 4 , 5.2 ) Gastric retention. ( 4 , 5.3 ) Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma.

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions : Promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction. ( 5.2 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. ( 5.3 ) Central Nervous System Effects: Somnolence has been reported with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. ( 5.4 ) Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use Solifenacin Succinate Tablets with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.5 ) QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation : Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are not recommended for use in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients taking medications known to prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema and Anaphylactic Reactions Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx have been reported with solifenacin succinate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Anaphylactic reactions have also been reported in patients treated with solifenacin succinate. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling and anaphylactic reactions may be life-threatening. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to solifenacin succinate [see . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue Solifenacin Succinate Tablets andprovide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway. Contraindications (4) ] 5.2 Urinary Retention The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may result in further decreased gastrointestinal motility. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see . The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients with conditions associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Contraindications (4) ] 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Solifenacin Succinate Tablets are associated with antimuscarinic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see A variety of CNS antimuscarinic adverse reactions have been reported, including headache, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Monitor patients for signs of antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how Solifenacin Succinate Tablets affect them. If a patient experiences antimuscarinic CNS adverse reactions, consider dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.5 Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Solifenacin Succinate Tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6 QT Prolongation in Patients at High Risk of QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of solifenacin succinate on the QT interval conducted in 76 healthy women [see , solifenacin succinate 30 mg (three times the largest maximum recommended dose in adultpatients) was associated with a mean increase in the Fridericia-corrected QT interval of 8 msec (90% CI, 4, 13). The QTprolonging effect appeared less with solifenacin succinate 10 mg than with solifenacin succinate 30 mg, and the effect ofsolifenacin succinate 30 mg did not appear as large as that of the positive control moxifloxacin at its therapeutic dose. Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] The use of Solifenacin Succinate Tablets is not recommended in patients at high risk of QT prolongation, including patients with a known history of QT prolongation and patients who are taking medications known to prolong the QT interval.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (> 4% in solifenacin succinate-treated patients and > placebo-treated patients) were dry mouth and constipation at both 5 mg and 10 mg doses; and urinary tract infection and blurred vision at the 10 mg dose. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AustarPharma LLC at 1-844-375-5410 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Solifenacin Succinate Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 1811 adult patients in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1-4) [see . Expected adverse reactions of antimuscarinic agents are dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision (accommodation abnormalities), urinary retention, and dry eyes. The incidence of dry mouth and constipation in patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets was higher in the 10 mg dose group compared to the 5 mg dose group. Clinical Studies (14) ] In the four 12-week double-blind clinical trials, severe fecal impaction, colonic obstruction, and intestinal obstruction were reported in one patient each, all in the Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 10 mg group. Angioneurotic edema was reported in one patient taking Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 mg. Compared to 12 weeks of treatment with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets, the incidence and severity of adverse reactions were similar in patients who remained on drug for up to 12 months in Study 5 [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] The most frequent adverse reaction leading to study discontinuation was dry mouth (1.5%). Table 1 lists the rates of identified adverse reactions, in the four randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with Solifenacin Succinate Tablets 5 or 10 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.
