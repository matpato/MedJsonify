    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Megestrol acetate oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, or an unexplained significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Limitations of Use Therapy with megestrol acetate oral suspension for weight loss should only be insti­tuted after treatable causes of weight loss are sought and addressed. These treatable causes include possible malignancies, systemic infections, gastrointestinal disorders affecting absorption, endocrine disease, renal disease or psychiatric diseases. Megestrol acetate oral suspension is not intended for prophylactic use to avoid weight loss. Megestrol acetate oral suspension is a progestin indicated for the treatment of anorexia, cachexia, or an unexplained significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1) .",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS History of hypersensitivity to megestrol acetate or any component of the formulation. Pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. History of hypersensitivity to megestrol acetate or any component of the formulation ( 4 ). Pregnancy ( 4 )( 8.1 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease (5.1) . Fetal Effects: May cause fetal harm. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant ( 5.2 ). Clinical cases of overt Cushing's Syndrome have been reported in association with the chronic use of megestrol acetate.  In addition, clinical cases of adrenal insufficiency have been observed in patients receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate in the stressed and non-stressed state (5.3) . New onset and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes have been reported (5.4) . 5.1 General Effects on HIV viral replication have not been determined. Use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease. 5.2 Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies, megestrol acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pregnant rats treated with low doses of megestrol acetate resulted in a reduction in fetal weight and number of live births, and feminization of male fetuses. There are no available human data to assess for any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking (receiving) this drug, advise the patient  of the poten­tial hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )]. Obtain a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with megestrol acetate oral suspension [see Dosage and Administration ( Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while taking megestrol acetate oral suspension 2.1 )]. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 )]. 5.3 Adrenal Insufficiency The glucocorticoid activity of megestrol acetate oral suspension has not been fully evaluated. Clinical cases of overt Cushing's Syndrome have been reported in association with the chronic use of megestrol acetate. In addition, clinical cases of adrenal insufficiency have been observed in patients receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate therapy in the stressed and non-stressed state. Furthermore, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation testing has revealed the frequent occurrence of asymptomatic pituitary-adrenal suppression in patients treated with chronic megestrol acetate therapy. Therefore, the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered in any patient receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate oral suspension therapy who presents with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of hypoadrenalism (e.g., hypotension, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or weakness) in either the stressed or non-stressed state. Laboratory evaluation for adrenal insufficiency and consideration of replacement or stress doses of a rapidly acting glucocorticoid are strongly recommended in such patients. Failure to recognize inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis may result in death. Finally, in patients who are receiving or being withdrawn from chronic megestrol acetate oral suspension therapy, consideration should be given to the use of empiric therapy with stress doses of a rapidly acting glucocorticoid during stress or serious intercurrent illness (e.g., surgery, infection). 5.4 Diabetes Clinical cases of new onset diabetes mellitus and exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus have been reported in association with the chronic use of megestrol acetate.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events occurring in > 5% of all patients receiving 800mg/20mL of megestrol acetate oral suspension in the two clinical efficacy trials were nausea, diarrhea, impotence, rash, flatulence, hypertension, and asthenia (6.2) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-518-2989 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Serious and Otherwise Important Adverse Reactions The following serious reactions and otherwise important adverse drug reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Thromboembolic Disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Diabetes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] 6.2 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of megestrol acetate oral suspension, 125 mg/mL was based on three studies of megestrol acetate oral suspension (40 mg/mL).  The adverse reaction profile of these 3 studies are presented below. Adverse events which occurred in at least 5% of patients in any arm of the two clinical efficacy trials and the open trial for megestrol acetate oral suspension are listed below by treatment group. All patients listed had at least one post baseline visit during the 12 study weeks.
