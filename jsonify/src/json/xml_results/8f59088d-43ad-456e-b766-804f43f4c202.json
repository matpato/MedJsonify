    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Maintenance of Normal Sinus Rhythm (Delay in AF/AFl Recurrence) Dofetilide capsules are indicated for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm (delay in time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter [AF/AFl]) in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter of greater than one week duration who have been converted to normal sinus rhythm. Because dofetilide capsules can cause life threatening ventricular arrhythmias, it should be reserved for patients in whom atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter is highly symptomatic. In general, antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter aims to prolong the time in normal sinus rhythm. Recurrence is expected in some patients (see ). CLINICAL STUDIES Conversion of Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Dofetilide capsules are indicated for the conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Dofetilide capsules have not been shown to be effective in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Dofetilide capsules are contraindicated in patients with congenital or acquired long QT syndromes. Dofetilide capsules should not be used in patients with a baseline QT interval or QTc >440 msec (500 msec in patients with ventricular conduction abnormalities). Dofetilide capsules are also contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance <20 mL/min). The concomitant use of verapamil or the cation transport system inhibitors cimetidine, trimethoprim (alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole), or ketoconazole with dofetilide capsules is contraindicated (see ), as each of these drugs cause a substantial increase in dofetilide plasma concentrations. In addition, other known inhibitors of the renal cation transport system such as prochlorperazine, dolutegravir and megestrol should not be used in patients on dofetilide capsules. WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug-Drug Interactions The concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide (alone or in combinations such as with triamterene) with dofetilide capsules is contraindicated (see ) because this has been shown to significantly increase dofetilide plasma concentrations and QT interval prolongation. PRECAUTIONS, Drug-Drug Interactions Dofetilide capsules are also contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Ventricular Arrhythmia Dofetilide capsules can cause serious ventricular arrhythmias, primarily Torsade de Pointes (TdP) type ventricular tachycardia, a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with QT interval prolongation. QT interval prolongation is directly related to dofetilide plasma concentration. Factors such as reduced creatinine clearance or certain dofetilide drug interactions will increase dofetilide plasma concentration. The risk of TdP can be reduced by controlling the plasma concentration through adjustment of the initial dofetilide dose according to creatinine clearance and by monitoring the ECG for excessive increases in the QT interval. Treatment with dofetilide must therefore be started only in patients placed for a minimum of three days in a facility that can provide electrocardiographic monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias. Calculation of the creatinine clearance for all patients must precede administration of the first dose of dofetilide. For detailed instructions regarding dose selection, see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . The risk of dofetilide induced ventricular arrhythmia was assessed in three ways in clinical studies: 1) by description of the QT interval and its relation to the dose and plasma concentration of dofetilide; 2) by observing the frequency of TdP in dofetilide capsules-treated patients according to dose; 3) by observing the overall mortality rate in patients with atrial fibrillation and in patients with structural heart disease. Relation of QT Interval to Dose The QT interval increases linearly with increasing dofetilide capsules dose (see Figures 1 and 2 in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and Dose-Response and Concentration Response for Increase in QT Interval ). Frequency of Torsade de Pointes In the supraventricular arrhythmia population (patients with AF and other supraventricular arrhythmias), the overall incidence of Torsade de Pointes was 0.8%. The frequency of TdP by dose is shown in Table 4. There were no cases of TdP on placebo. Table 4: Summary of Torsade de Pointes in Patients Randomized to Dofetilide by Dose; Patients with Supraventricular Arrhythmias Dofetilide Capsules Dose <250 mcg BID 250 mcg BID >250–500 mcg BID >500 mcg BID All Doses Number of Patients 217 388 703 38 1346 Torsade de Pointes 0 1 (0.3%) 6 (0.9%) 4 (10.5%) 11 (0.8%) As shown in Table 5, the rate of TdP was reduced when patients were dosed according to their renal function (see and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations, Renal Impairment ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Table 5: Incidence of Torsade de Pointes Before and After Introduction of Dosing According to Renal Function Population: Total Before After n/N % n/N % n/N % Supraventricular Arrhythmias 11/1346 (0.8%) 6/193 (3.1%) 5/1153 (0.4%) DIAMOND CHF 25/762 (3.3%) 7/148 (4.7%) 18/614 (2.9%) DIAMOND MI 7/749 (0.9%) 3/101 (3.0%) 4/648 (0.6%) DIAMOND AF 4/249 (1.6%) 0/43 (0%) 4/206 (1.9%) The majority of the episodes of TdP occurred within the first three days of dofetilide capsules therapy (10/11 events in the studies of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias; 19/25 and 4/7 events in DIAMOND CHF and DIAMOND MI, respectively; 2/4 events in the DIAMOND AF subpopulation). Mortality In a pooled survival analysis of patients in the supraventricular arrhythmia population (low prevalence of structural heart disease), deaths occurred in 0.9% (12/1346) of patients receiving dofetilide capsules and 0.4% (3/677) in the placebo group. Adjusted for duration of therapy, primary diagnosis, age, gender, and prevalence of structural heart disease, the point estimate of the hazard ratio for the pooled studies (dofetilide capsules/placebo) was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.3, 4.3). The DIAMOND CHF and MI trials examined mortality in patients with structural heart disease (ejection fraction ≤35%). In these large, double-blind studies, deaths occurred in 36% (541/1511) of dofetilide capsules patients and 37% (560/1517) of placebo patients. In an analysis of 506 DIAMOND patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter at baseline, one year mortality on dofetilide capsules was 31% vs. 32% on placebo (see ). CLINICAL STUDIES Because of the small number of events, an excess mortality due to dofetilide capsules cannot be ruled out with confidence in the pooled survival analysis of placebo-controlled trials in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias. However, it is reassuring that in two large placebo-controlled mortality studies in patients with significant heart disease (DIAMOND CHF/MI), there were no more deaths in dofetilide capsules-treated patients than in patients given placebo (see ). CLINICAL STUDIES Drug-Drug Interactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) Because there is a linear relationship between dofetilide plasma concentration and QTc, concomitant drugs that interfere with the metabolism or renal elimination of dofetilide may increase the risk of arrhythmia (Torsade de Pointes). Dofetilide is metabolized to a small degree by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 system and an inhibitor of this system could increase systemic dofetilide exposure. More important, dofetilide is eliminated by cationic renal secretion, and three inhibitors of this process have been shown to increase systemic dofetilide exposure. The magnitude of the effect on renal elimination by cimetidine, trimethoprim, and ketoconazole (all contraindicated concomitant uses with dofetilide) suggests that all renal cation transport inhibitors should be contraindicated. Hypokalemia and Potassium-Depleting Diuretics Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may occur with administration of potassium-depleting diuretics, increasing the potential for Torsade de Pointes. Potassium levels should be within the normal range prior to administration of dofetilide capsules and maintained in the normal range during administration of dofetilide capsules (see ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use with Drugs that Prolong QT Interval and Antiarrhythmic Agents The use of dofetilide capsules in conjunction with other drugs that prolong the QT interval has not been studied and is not recommended. Such drugs include phenothiazines, cisapride, bepridil, tricyclic antidepressants, certain oral macrolides, and certain fluoroquinolones. Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic agents should be withheld for at least three half-lives prior to dosing with dofetilide capsules. In clinical trials, dofetilide capsules were administered to patients previously treated with oral amiodarone only if serum amiodarone levels were below 0.3 mg/L or amiodarone had been withdrawn for at least three months.PRECAUTIONS Renal Impairment The overall systemic clearance of dofetilide is decreased and plasma concentration increased with decreasing creatinine clearance. The dose of dofetilide capsules must be adjusted based on creatinine clearance (see ). Patients undergoing dialysis were not included in clinical studies, and appropriate dosing recommendations for these patients are unknown. There is no information about the effectiveness of hemodialysis in removing dofetilide from plasma. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hepatic Impairment After adjustment for creatinine clearance, no additional dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied. Dofetilide capsules should be used with particular caution in these patients. Cardiac Conduction Disturbances Animal and human studies have not shown any adverse effects of dofetilide on conduction velocity. No effect on AV nodal conduction following dofetilide capsules treatment was noted in normal volunteers and in patients with 1 st degree heart block. Patients with sick sinus syndrome or with 2 nd or 3 rd degree heart block were not included in the Phase 3 clinical trials unless a functioning pacemaker was present. Dofetilide capsules have been used safely in conjunction with pacemakers (53 patients in DIAMOND studies, 136 in trials in patients with ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias). Information for Patients Please refer patient to the Medication Guide. Prior to initiation of dofetilide capsules therapy, the patient should be advised to read the Medication Guide and reread it each time therapy is renewed in case the patient's status has changed. The patient should be fully instructed on the need for compliance with the recommended dosing of dofetilide capsules and the potential for drug interactions, and the need for periodic monitoring of QTc and renal function to minimize the risk of serious abnormal rhythms. Medications and Supplements Assessment of patients' medication history should include all over-the-counter, prescription, and herbal/natural preparations with emphasis on preparations that may affect the pharmacokinetics of dofetilide capsules such as cimetidine (see ), trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ), prochlorperazine (see WARNINGS , CONTRAINDICATIONS ), megestrol (see WARNINGS , CONTRAINDICATIONS ), ketoconazole (see WARNINGS , CONTRAINDICATIONS ), dolutegravir (see WARNINGS , CONTRAINDICATIONS ), hydrochlorothiazide (alone or in combinations such as with triamterene) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ), other cardiovascular drugs (especially verapamil – see CONTRAINDICATIONS ), phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If a patient is taking dofetilide capsules and requires anti-ulcer therapy, omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) should be used as alternatives to cimetidine, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of dofetilide capsules. Patients should be instructed to notify their health care providers of any change in over-the-counter, prescription, or supplement use. If a patient is hospitalized or is prescribed a new medication for any condition, the patient must inform the health care provider of ongoing dofetilide capsules therapy. Patients should also check with their health care provider and/or pharmacist prior to taking a new over-the-counter preparation. WARNINGS Electrolyte Imbalance If patients experience symptoms that may be associated with altered electrolyte balance, such as excessive or prolonged diarrhea, sweating, or vomiting or loss of appetite or thirst, these conditions should immediately be reported to their health care provider. Dosing Schedule Patients should be instructed NOT to double the next dose if a dose is missed. The next dose should be taken at the usual time. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions None known. Drug-Drug Interactions Cimetidine (see ) Concomitant use of cimetidine is contraindicated. Cimetidine at 400 mg BID (the usual prescription dose) co-administered with dofetilide capsules (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide plasma levels by 58%. Cimetidine at doses of 100 mg BID (OTC dose) resulted in a 13% increase in dofetilide plasma levels (500 mcg single dose). No studies have been conducted at intermediate doses of cimetidine. If a patient requires dofetilide capsules and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole, ranitidine, or antacids (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides) be used as alternatives to cimetidine, as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of dofetilide capsules. WARNINGS , CONTRAINDICATIONS Verapamil (see ) Concomitant use of verapamil is contraindicated. Co-administration of dofetilide capsules with verapamil resulted in increases in dofetilide peak plasma levels of 42%, although overall exposure to dofetilide was not significantly increased. In an analysis of the supraventricular arrhythmia and DIAMOND patient populations, the concomitant administration of verapamil with dofetilide was associated with a higher occurrence of Torsade de Pointes. CONTRAINDICATIONS Ketoconazole (see ) Concomitant use of ketoconazole is contraindicated. Ketoconazole at 400 mg daily (the maximum approved prescription dose) co-administered with dofetilide capsules (500 mcg BID) for 7 days has been shown to increase dofetilide C WARNINGS , CONTRAINDICATIONS max by 53% in males and 97% in females, and AUC by 41% in males and 69% in females. Trimethoprim Alone or in Combination with Sulfamethoxazole (see ) Concomitant use of trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated. Trimethoprim 160 mg in combination with 800 mg sulfamethoxazole co-administered BID with dofetilide capsules (500 mcg BID) for 4 days has been shown to increase dofetilide AUC by 103% and C WARNINGS , CONTRAINDICATIONS max by 93%. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) Alone or in Combination with Triamterene (see ) Concomitant use of HCTZ alone or in combination with triamterene is contraindicated. HCTZ 50 mg QD or HCTZ/triamterene 50/100 mg QD was co-administered with dofetilide capsules (500 mcg BID) for 5 days (following 2 days of diuretic use at half dose). In patients receiving HCTZ alone, dofetilide AUC increased by 27% and C CONTRAINDICATIONS max by 21%. However, the pharmacodynamic effect increased by 197% (QTc increase over time) and by 95% (maximum QTc increase). In patients receiving HCTZ in combination with triamterene, dofetilide AUC increased by 30% and C max by 16%. However, the pharmacodynamic effect increased by 190% (QTc increase over time) and by 84% (maximum QTc increase). The pharmacodynamic effects can be explained by a combination of the increase in dofetilide exposure and the reductions in serum potassium. In the DIAMOND trials, 1252 patients were treated with dofetilide capsules and diuretics concomitantly, of whom 493 died compared to 508 deaths among the 1248 patients receiving placebo and diuretics. Of the 229 patients who had potassium depleting diuretics added to their concomitant medications in the DIAMOND trials, the patients on dofetilide capsules had a non-significantly reduced relative risk for death of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.376, 1.230). Potential Drug Interactions Dofetilide is eliminated in the kidney by cationic secretion. Inhibitors of renal cationic secretion are contraindicated with dofetilide capsules. In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e.g., triamterene, metformin, and amiloride) should be co-administered with care as they might increase dofetilide levels. Dofetilide is metabolized to a small extent by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme of the cytochrome P450 system. Inhibitors of the CYP3A4 isoenzyme could increase systemic dofetilide exposure. Inhibitors of this isoenzyme (e.g., macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungal agents, protease inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, amiodarone, cannabinoids, diltiazem, grapefruit juice, nefazadone, norfloxacin, quinine, zafirlukast) should be cautiously co-administered with dofetilide capsules as they can potentially increase dofetilide levels. Dofetilide is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 nor of other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2D6) and is not expected to increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Other Drug Interaction Information Digoxin Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that dofetilide capsules do not affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. In patients, the concomitant administration of digoxin with dofetilide was associated with a higher occurrence of Torsade de Pointes. It is not clear whether this represents an interaction with dofetilide capsules or the presence of more severe structural heart disease in patients on digoxin; structural heart disease is a known risk factor for arrhythmia. No increase in mortality was observed in patients taking digoxin as concomitant medication. Other Drugs In healthy volunteers, amlodipine, phenytoin, glyburide, ranitidine, omeprazole, hormone replacement therapy (a combination of conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone), antacid (aluminum and magnesium hydroxides), and theophylline did not affect the pharmacokinetics of dofetilide capsules. In addition, studies in healthy volunteers have shown that dofetilide capsules do not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin, or the pharmacokinetics of propranolol (40 mg twice daily), phenytoin, theophylline, or oral contraceptives. Population pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted on plasma concentration data from 1445 patients in clinical trials to examine the effects of concomitant medications on clearance or volume of distribution of dofetilide. Concomitant medications were grouped as ACE inhibitors, oral anticoagulants, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, cardiac glycosides, inducers of CYP3A4, substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4, substrates and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein, nitrates, sulphonylureas, loop diuretics, potassium sparing diuretics, thiazide diuretics, substrates and inhibitors of tubular organic cation transport, and QTc-prolonging drugs. Differences in clearance between patients on these medications (at any occasion in the study) and those off medications varied between -16% and +3%. The mean clearances of dofetilide were 16% and 15% lower in patients on thiazide diuretics and inhibitors of tubular organic cation transport, respectively. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dofetilide had no genotoxic effects, with or without metabolic activation, based on the bacterial mutation assay and tests of cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes. Rats and mice treated with dofetilide in the diet for two years showed no evidence of an increased incidence of tumors compared to controls. The highest dofetilide dose administered for 24 months was 10 mg/kg/day to rats and 20 mg/kg/day to mice. Mean dofetilide AUCs (0–24hr) at these doses were about 26 and 10 times, respectively, the maximum likely human AUC. There was no effect on mating or fertility when dofetilide was administered to male and female rats at doses as high as 1.0 mg/kg/day, a dose that would be expected to provide a mean dofetilide AUC (0–24hr) about 3 times the maximum likely human AUC. Increased incidences of testicular atrophy and epididymal oligospermia and a reduction in testicular weight were, however, observed in other studies in rats. Reduced testicular weight and increased incidence of testicular atrophy were also consistent findings in dogs and mice. The no effect doses for these findings in chronic administration studies in these 3 species (3, 0.1, and 6 mg/kg/day) were associated with mean dofetilide AUCs that were about 4, 1.3, and 3 times the maximum likely human AUC, respectively. Pregnancy Dofetilide has been shown to adversely affect in utero growth and survival of rats and mice when orally administered during organogenesis at doses of 2 or more mg/kg/day. Other than an increased incidence of non-ossified 5 th metacarpal, and the occurrence of hydroureter and hydronephroses at doses as low as 1 mg/kg/day in the rat, structural anomalies associated with drug treatment were not observed in either species at doses below 2 mg/kg/day. The clearest drug-effect associations were for sternebral and vertebral anomalies in both species; cleft palate, adactyly, levocardia, dilation of cerebral ventricles, hydroureter, hydronephroses, and unossified metacarpal in the rat; and increased incidence of unossified calcaneum in the mouse. The \"no observed adverse effect dose\" in both species was 0.5 mg/kg/day. The mean dofetilide AUCs (0– 24hr) at this dose in the rat and mouse are estimated to be about equal to the maximum likely human AUC and about half the likely human AUC, respectively. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, dofetilide should only be administered to pregnant women where the benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers There is no information on the presence of dofetilide in breast milk. Patients should be advised not to breast-feed an infant if they are taking dofetilide capsules. Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of dofetilide capsules, 46% were 65 to 89 years old. No overall differences in safety, effect on QTc, or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function with a reduced creatinine clearance, care must be taken in dose selection (see ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use in Women Female patients constituted 32% of the patients in the placebo-controlled trials of dofetilide capsules. As with other drugs that cause Torsade de Pointes, dofetilide capsules were associated with a greater risk of Torsade de Pointes in female patients than in male patients. During the dofetilide capsules clinical development program, the risk of Torsade de Pointes in females was approximately 3 times the risk in males. Unlike Torsade de Pointes, the incidence of other ventricular arrhythmias was similar in female patients receiving dofetilide capsules and patients receiving placebo. Although no study specifically investigated this risk, in post-hoc analyses, no increased mortality was observed in females on dofetilide capsules compared to females on placebo. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of dofetilide capsules in children (<18 years old) has not been established.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The dofetilide capsules clinical program involved approximately 8,600 patients in 130 clinical studies of normal volunteers and patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Dofetilide capsules were administered to 5,194 patients, including two large, placebo-controlled mortality trials (DIAMOND CHF and DIAMOND MI) in which 1,511 patients received dofetilide capsules for up to three years. In the following section, adverse reaction data for cardiac arrhythmias and non-cardiac adverse reactions are presented separately for patients included in the supraventricular arrhythmia development program and for patients included in the DIAMOND CHF and MI mortality trials (see , for a description of these trials). CLINICAL STUDIES, Safety in Patients with Structural Heart Disease, DIAMOND Studies In studies of patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, a total of 1,346 and 677 patients were exposed to dofetilide capsules and placebo for 551 and 207 patient years, respectively. A total of 8.7% of patients in the dofetilide groups were discontinued from clinical trials due to adverse events compared to 8.0% in the placebo groups. The most frequent reason for discontinuation (>1%) was ventricular tachycardia (2.0% on dofetilide vs. 1.3% on placebo). The most frequent adverse events were headache, chest pain, and dizziness. Serious Arrhythmias and Conduction Disturbances Torsade de Pointes is the only arrhythmia that showed a dose-response relationship to dofetilide capsules treatment. It did not occur in placebo treated patients. The incidence of Torsade de Pointes in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias was 0.8% (11/1346) (see ). The incidence of Torsade de Pointes in patients who were dosed according to the recommended dosing regimen (see WARNINGS ) was 0.8% (4/525). Table 6 shows the frequency by randomized dose of serious arrhythmias and conduction disturbances reported as adverse events in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias.

Table 8: Frequency of Adverse Events Occurring at >2% on Dofetilide Capsules, and Numerically More Frequently on Dofetilide Capsules than Placebo in Patients with Supraventricular Arrhythmias Dofetilide Capsules Placebo Adverse Event % % headache 11 9 chest pain 10 7 dizziness 8 6 respiratory tract infection 7 5 dyspnea 6 5 nausea 5 4 flu syndrome 4 2 insomnia 4 3 accidental injury 3 1 back pain 3 2 procedure (medical/surgical/health service) 3 2 diarrhea 3 2 rash 3 2 abdominal pain 3 2 Adverse events reported at a rate >2% but no more frequently on dofetilide capsules than on placebo were: angina pectoris, anxiety, arthralgia, asthenia, atrial fibrillation, complications (application, injection, incision, insertion, or device), hypertension, pain, palpitation, peripheral edema, supraventricular tachycardia, sweating, urinary tract infection, ventricular tachycardia. The following adverse events have been reported with a frequency of ≤2% and numerically more frequently with dofetilide capsules than placebo in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias: angioedema, bradycardia, cerebral ischemia, cerebrovascular accident, edema, facial paralysis, flaccid paralysis, heart arrest, increased cough, liver damage, migraine, myocardial infarct, paralysis, paresthesia, sudden death, and syncope. The incidences of clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities in patients with supraventricular arrhythmias were similar for patients on dofetilide capsules and those on placebo. No clinically relevant effects were noted in serum alkaline phosphatase, serum GGT, LDH, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, total protein, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum electrolytes (calcium, chloride, glucose, magnesium, potassium, sodium), or creatine kinase. Similarly, no clinically relevant effects were observed in hematologic parameters. In the DIAMOND population, adverse events other than those related to the post-infarction and heart failure patient population were generally similar to those seen in the supraventricular arrhythmia groups."
