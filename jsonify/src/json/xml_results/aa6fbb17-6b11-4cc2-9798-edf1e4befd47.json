    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Second primary malignancies: In patients treated with Docetaxel Injection-containing regimens, monitor for delayed AML, MDS, NHL, and renal cancer. ( 5.7 ) • Cutaneous reactions: Reactions including erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation may occur. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported. Severe skin toxicity may require dose adjustment or permanent treatment discontinuation. ( 5.8 ) • Neurologic reactions: Reactions including paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain may occur. Severe neurosensory symptoms require dose adjustment or discontinuation if persistent. ( 5.9 ) • Eye disorders: Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported and requires treatment discontinuation. ( 5.10 ) • Asthenia: Severe asthenia may occur and may require treatment discontinuation. ( 5.11 ) • Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.12 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) • Alcohol content: The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system. This may include impairment of a patient’s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion. ( 5.13 ) • Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported. Patients at risk should be well hydrated and closely monitored during treatment. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel administered at 100 mg/m 2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2.0% (19/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, both previously treated and untreated, with normal baseline liver function and in 11.5% (7/61) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function (AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN together with AP >2.5 times ULN). Among patients dosed at 60 mg/m 2 , mortality related to treatment occurred in 0.6% (3/481) of patients with normal liver function, and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function. Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle. Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths. Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel administered at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment-related mortality (14% and 5% in two randomized, controlled studies). There were 2.8% treatment-related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg/m 2 dose in the randomized trials. Among patients who experienced treatment-related mortality at the 75 mg/m 2 dose level, 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Studies (14) 5.2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increased risk for the development of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, severe thrombocytopenia, severe stomatitis, severe skin toxicity, and toxic death. Avoid Docetaxel Injection in patients with bilirubin > upper limit of normal (ULN), or to patients with AST and/or ALT >1.5 × ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 × ULN [ see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) For patients with isolated elevations of transaminase >1.5 × ULN, consider Docetaxel Injection dose modifications [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.7) Measure bilirubin, AST or ALT, and alkaline phosphatase prior to each cycle of Docetaxel Injection therapy. 5.3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving Docetaxel Injection. Do not retreat patients with subsequent cycles of Docetaxel Injection until neutrophils recover to a level >1500 cells/mm 3 [ see ]. Avoid retreating patients until platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm Contraindications (4) 3 . A 25% reduction in the dose of Docetaxel Injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3 ) lasting 7 days or more, febrile neutropenia, or a grade 4 infection in a Docetaxel Injection cycle [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.7) Neutropenia (<2000 neutrophils/mm 3 ) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg/m 2 to 100 mg/m 2 of docetaxel and grade 4 neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3 ) occurs in 85% of patients given 100 mg/m 2 and 75% of patients given 60 mg/m 2 . Frequent monitoring of blood counts is, therefore, essential so that dose can be adjusted. Docetaxel Injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils <1500 cells/mm 3 . Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12% of patients given 100 mg/m 2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg/m 2 . Hematologic responses, febrile reactions and infections, and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [ see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14) Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment (bilirubin >1.7 times ULN) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil (TCF), febrile neutropenia and/or neutropenic infection occurred in 12% of patients receiving G-CSF compared to 28% who did not. Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Adverse Reactions (6) 5.4 Enterocolitis and Neutropenic Colitis Enterocolitis and neutropenic colitis (typhlitis) have occurred in patients treated with Docetaxel Injection alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, despite the coadministration of G-CSF. Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia, particularly at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications. Enterocolitis and neutropenic enterocolitis may develop at any time, and could lead to death as early as the first day of symptom onset. Monitor patients closely from onset of any symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity. Inform patients to contact their healthcare provider with new, or worsening symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Monitor patients closely for hypersensitivity reactions, especially during the first and second infusions. Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash/erythema, hypotension and/or bronchospasm, or fatal anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids. Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the Docetaxel Injection infusion and aggressive therapy. Do not rechallenge patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions with Docetaxel Injection [ see ]. Contraindications (4) Patients who have previously experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel that may include severe or fatal reactions such as anaphylaxis. Monitor patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel closely during initiation of docetaxel therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a Docetaxel Injection infusion. If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur, interruption of therapy is not required. All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of Docetaxel Injection [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.6) 5.6 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each Docetaxel Injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [ see ]. Patients with pre-existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. Dosage and Administration (2.6) When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, moderate fluid retention occurred in 27.2% and severe fluid retention in 6.5%. The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg/m 2 . Nine of 92 patients (9.8%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention: 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention. The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg/m 2 . Fluid retention was completely, but sometimes slowly, reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel to resolution (range: 0 to 42+ weeks). Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). 5.7 Second Primary Malignancies Second primary malignancies, notably acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), and renal cancer, have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel-containing regimens. These adverse reactions may occur several months or years after docetaxel-containing therapy. Treatment-related AML or MDS has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide, including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. In the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. In TAC-treated patients, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow-up. Monitor patients for second primary malignancies [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.8 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed. In case of severe skin toxicity, an adjustment in dosage is recommended [ see ]. The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1.6% (15/965) for metastatic breast cancer patients. Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids, there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel due to skin toxicity. Dosage and Administration (2.7) Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with docetaxel treatment. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and monitored closely. Permanent treatment discontinuation should be considered in patients who experience SCARs. 5.9 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms (e.g.,paresthesia, dysesthesia, pain) were observed in 5.5% (53/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients, and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6.1%. When these symptoms occur, dosage must be adjusted. If symptoms persist, treatment should be discontinued [ see ]. Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow-up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset (range: 0 to 106 weeks). Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4.4% (42/965). Dosage and Administration (2.7) 5.10 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema (CME) has been reported in patients treated with Docetaxel Injection. Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. If CME is diagnosed, Docetaxel injection treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated. Alternative non-taxane cancer treatment should be considered. 5.11 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14.9% (144/965) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1.8%. Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease. 5.12 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, Docetaxel Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see ]. Available data from case reports in the literature and pharmacovigilance with docetaxel use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform the drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, administration of docetaxel to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including intrauterine mortality, at doses as low as 0.02 and 0.003 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area, respectively. Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Docetaxel Injection. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 months after the last dose of Docetaxel Injection. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of Docetaxel Injection [ see ]. Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) 5.13 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content. The alcohol content in a dose of Docetaxel Injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized. Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in Docetaxel Injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion. Each administration of Docetaxel Injection at 100 mg/m 2 delivers 1.8 g/m 2 of ethanol. For a patient with a BSA of 2.0 m 2 , this would deliver 3.6 grams of ethanol [ see ]. Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol. Description (11) 5.14 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel [ see ]. Patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g., with renal impairment, hyperuricemia, bulky tumor) should be closely monitored prior to initiating Docetaxel Injection and periodically during treatment. Correction of dehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment. Adverse Reactions (6.2)",

Incidence varies depending on the indication. Adverse reactions are described according to indication. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening. The relationship between changes in performance status, response to therapy, and treatment-related side effects has not been established. Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, mucositis, alopecia, skin reactions, and myalgia.

These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel. At least 95% of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support. The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types (see Table 3). Table 3: Summary of Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving Docetaxel at 100 mg/m 2 Adverse Reaction All Tumor Types Normal LFTs Normal Baseline LFTs: Transaminases ≤1.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN or isolated elevations of transaminases or alkaline phosphatase up to 5 times ULN n=2045 % All Tumor Types Elevated LFTs Elevated Baseline LFTs: AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN n=61 % Breast Cancer Normal LFTs n=965 % Hematologic Neutropenia <2000 cells/mm 3 96 96 99 <500 cells/mm 3 75 88 86 Leukopenia <4000 cells/mm 3 96 98 99 <1000 cells/mm 3 32 47 44 Thrombocytopenia <100,000 cells/mm 3 8 25 9 Anemia <11 g/dL 90 92 94 <8 g/dL 9 31 8 Febrile Neutropenia Febrile Neutropenia: ANC grade 4 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization 11 26 12 Septic Death 2 5 1 Non-Septic Death 1 7 1 Infections Any 22 33 22 Severe 6 16 6 Fever in Absence of Infection Any 31 41 35 Severe 2 8 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Regardless of Premedication Any 21 20 18 Severe 4 10 3 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 15 33 15 Severe 2 0 2 Fluid Retention Regardless of Premedication Any 47 39 60 Severe 7 8 9 With 3-day Premedication n=92 n=3 n=92 Any 64 67 64 Severe 7 33 7 Neurosensory Any 49 34 58 Severe 4 0 6 Cutaneous Any 48 54 47 Severe 5 10 5 Nail Changes Any 31 23 41 Severe 3 5 4 Gastrointestinal Nausea 39 38 42 Vomiting 22 23 23 Diarrhea 39 33 43 Severe 5 5 6 Stomatitis Any 42 49 52 Severe 6 13 7 Alopecia 76 62 74 Asthenia Any 62 53 66 Severe 13 25 15 Myalgia Any 19 16 21 Severe 2 2 2 Arthralgia 9 7 8 Infusion Site Reactions 4 3 4 Hematologic Reactions Reversible marrow suppression was the major dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel [ see ]. The median time to nadir was 7 days, while the median duration of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm Warnings and Precautions (5.3) 3 ) was 7 days. Among 2045 patients with solid tumors and normal baseline LFTs, severe neutropenia occurred in 75.4% and lasted for more than 7 days in 2.9% of cycles. Febrile neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3 with fever >38°C with intravenous antibiotics and/or hospitalization) occurred in 11% of patients with solid tumors, in 12.3% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 9.8% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe infectious episodes occurred in 6.1% of patients with solid tumors, in 6.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 5.4% of 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 cells/mm 3 ) associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [ see ]. Minor events, including flushing, rash with or without pruritus, chest tightness, back pain, dyspnea, drug fever, or chills, have been reported and resolved after discontinuing the infusion and instituting appropriate therapy. Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.5) Fluid Retention Fluid retention can occur with the use of docetaxel [ see ]. Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Warnings and Precautions (5.6) Cutaneous Reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [ see ]. Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions, mainly on the feet and/or hands, but also on the arms, face, or thorax, usually associated with pruritus, have been observed. Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel infusion, recovered before the next infusion, and were not disabling. Warnings and Precautions (5.8) Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo- or hyperpigmentation, and occasionally by onycholysis (in 0.8% of patients with solid tumors) and pain. Neurologic Reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [ see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.9) Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate. Severe reactions occurred in 3% to 5% of patients with solid tumors and to a similar extent among metastatic breast cancer patients. The incidence of severe reactions was 1% or less for the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Severe stomatitis occurred in 5.5% of patients with solid tumors, in 7.4% of patients with metastatic breast cancer, and in 1.1% of the 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3-day corticosteroids. Cardiovascular Reactions Hypotension occurred in 2.8% of patients with solid tumors; 1.2% required treatment. Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure, sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, dysrhythmia, unstable angina, pulmonary edema, and hypertension have occurred. Seven of 86 (8.1%) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel 100 mg/m 2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥10% associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal. Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation, inflammation, redness or dryness of the skin, phlebitis, extravasation, or swelling of the vein. Hepatic Reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline, bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8.9% of patients. Increases in AST or ALT >1.5 times the ULN, or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN, were observed in 18.9% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. While on docetaxel, increases in AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN occurred in 4.3% of patients with normal LFTs at baseline. Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established. Hematologic and Other Toxicity: Relation to Dose and Baseline Liver Chemistry Abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests (LFTs). In the following tables, adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations: 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel at 100 mg/m 2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs (defined as AST and/or ALT >1.5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times ULN); and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel at 60 mg/m 2 who had normal LFTs (see Tables 4 and 5).

Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was reported in 5.3% of patients treated with 60 mg/m 2 versus 6.9% and 16.5% for patients treated at 75 mg/m 2 and 100 mg/m 2 , respectively. Deaths within 30 days of last treatment occurred in 4.0% of patients treated with 60 mg/m 2 compared to 5.3% and 1.6% for patients treated at 75 mg/m 2 and 100 mg/m 2 , respectively. The following adverse reactions were associated with increasing docetaxel doses: fluid retention (26%, 38%, and 46% at 60 mg/m 2 , 75 mg/m 2 , and 100 mg/m 2 , respectively), thrombocytopenia (7%, 11% and 12%, respectively), neutropenia (92%, 94%, and 97%, respectively), febrile neutropenia (5%, 7%, and 14%, respectively), treatment-related grade 3/4 infection (2%, 3%, and 7%, respectively) and anemia (87%, 94%, and 97%, respectively). Combination Therapy with Docetaxel in the Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer The following table presents treatment-emergent adverse reactions observed in 744 patients, who were treated with docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (see Table 6).

Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1% of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0.1% of cycles in the FAC arm. Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions, compared to 1.1% treated with FAC; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC-treated patients. Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs. Fever and Infection During the treatment period, fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46.5% of TAC-treated patients and in 17.1% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1.3% and 0% of TAC- and FAC-treated patients, respectively. Infection was seen in 39.4% of TAC-treated patients compared to 36.3% of FAC-treated patients. Grade 3/4 infection was seen in 3.9% and 2.2% of TAC-treated and FAC-treated patients, respectively. There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm during the treatment period. Gastrointestinal Reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above, 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis/enteritis/large intestine perforation versus one patient in the FAC arm. Five of the 7 TAC-treated patients required treatment discontinuation; no deaths due to these events occurred during the treatment period. Cardiovascular Reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm versus the FAC arm during the treatment period: arrhythmias, all grades (6.2% vs. 4.9%), and hypotension, all grades (1.9% vs. 0.8%). Twenty-six (26) patients (3.5%) in the TAC arm and 17 patients (2.3%) in the FAC arm developed CHF during the study period. All except one patient in each arm were diagnosed with CHF during the follow-up period. Two (2) patients in TAC arm and 4 patients in FAC arm died due to CHF. The risk of CHF was higher in the TAC arm in the first year, and then was similar in both treatment arms. Adverse Reactions during the Follow-Up Period (Median Follow-Up Time of 8 Years) In study TAX316, the most common adverse reactions that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up period in TAC and FAC patients are described below (median follow-up time of 8 years). Nervous System Disorders: In study TAX316, peripheral sensory neuropathy started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up period in 84 patients (11.3%) in TAC arm and 15 patients (2%) in FAC arm. At the end of the follow-up period (median follow-up time of 8 years), peripheral sensory neuropathy was observed to be ongoing in 10 patients (1.3%) in TAC arm, and in 2 patients (0.3%) in FAC arm. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: In study TAX316, alopecia persisting into the follow-up period after the end of chemotherapy was reported in 687 of 744 TAC patients (92.3%) and 645 of 736 FAC patients (87.6%). At the end of the follow-up period (actual median follow-up time of 8 years), alopecia was observed to be ongoing in 29 TAC patients (3.9%) and 16 FAC patients (2.2%). Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: In study TAX316, amenorrhea that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up period after the end of chemotherapy was reported in 202 of 744 TAC patients (27.2%) and 125 of 736 FAC patients (17.0%). Amenorrhea was observed to be ongoing at the end of the follow-up period (median follow-up time of 8 years) in 121 of 744 TAC patients (16.3%) and 86 FAC patients (11.7%). General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: In study TAX316, peripheral edema that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up period after the end of chemotherapy was observed in 119 of 744 TAC patients (16.0%) and 23 of 736 FAC patients (3.1%). At the end of the follow-up period (actual median follow-up time of 8 years), peripheral edema was ongoing in 19 TAC patients (2.6%) and 4 FAC patients (0.5%). In study TAX316, lymphedema that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up period after the end of chemotherapy was reported in 11 of 744 TAC patients (1.5%) and 1 of 736 FAC patients (0.1%). At the end of the follow-up period (actual median follow-up time of 8 years), lymphedema was observed to be ongoing in 6 TAC patients (0.8%) and 1 FAC patient (0.1%). In study TAX316, asthenia that started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow-up period after the end of chemotherapy was reported in 236 of 744 TAC patients (31.7%) and 180 of 736 FAC patients (24.5%). At the end of the follow-up period (actual median follow-up time of 8 years), asthenia was observed to be ongoing in 29 TAC patients (3.9%) and 16 FAC patients (2.2%). Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)/Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS): AML occurred in the adjuvant breast cancer trial (TAX316). The cumulative risk of developing treatment-related AML at median follow-up time of 8 years in TAX316 was 0.4% for TAC-treated patients and 0.1% for FAC-treated patients. One TAC patient (0.1%) and 1 FAC patient (0.1%) died due to AML during the follow-up period (median follow-up time of 8 years). Myelodysplastic syndrome occurred in 2 of 744 (0.3%) patients who received TAC and in 1 of 736 (0.1%) patients who received FAC. AML occurs at a higher frequency when these agents are given in combination with radiation therapy.

Because these reactions are reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a whole: diffuse pain, chest pain, radiation recall phenomenon, injection site recall reaction (recurrence of skin reaction at a site of previous extravasation following administration of docetaxel at a different site) at the site of previous extravasation. Cardiovascular: atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, ECG abnormalities, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, syncope, tachycardia, myocardial infarction. Ventricular arrhythmia, including ventricular tachycardia, in patients treated with docetaxel in combination regimens including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil and/or cyclophosphamide may be associated with fatal outcome. Cutaneous: cutaneous lupus erythematosus, bullous eruptions such as erythema multiforme and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, scleroderma-like changes (usually preceded by peripheral lymphedema), severe palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and permanent alopecia. Gastrointestinal: enterocolitis, including colitis, ischemic colitis, and neutropenic enterocolitis, which may be fatal. Abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, duodenal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction, ileus, and dehydration as a consequence of gastrointestinal events. Hearing: ototoxicity, hearing disorders and/or hearing loss, including during use with other ototoxic drugs. Hematologic: bleeding episodes, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), often in association with sepsis or multiorgan failure. Hepatic: hepatitis, sometimes fatal, primarily in patients with pre-existing liver disorders. Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic shock with fatal outcome in patients who received premedication. Severe hypersensitivity reactions with fatal outcome with docetaxel in patients who previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: electrolyte imbalance, including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia. Tumor lysis syndrome, sometimes fatal.
