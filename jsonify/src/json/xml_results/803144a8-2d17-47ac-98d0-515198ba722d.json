    "indications": "1\tINDICATIONS AND USAGE TOSYMRA is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. TOSYMRA is a serotonin (5-HT 1B/1D ) receptor agonist (triptan) indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established ( 1 ) Not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine ( 1 ) Not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established. If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with TOSYMRA, reconsider the diagnosis before TOSYMRA is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. TOSYMRA is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine. TOSYMRA is not indicated for the treatment of cluster headache.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5\tWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue TOSYMRA if occurs ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally, not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue TOSYMRA if occurs ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemia and reactions, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue TOSYMRA if occurs ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue TOSYMRA if occurs ( 5.7 ) Increase in blood pressure: Hypertensive crisis can occur ( 5.8 ) Hypersensitivity reactions: Angioedema and anaphylaxis can occur ( 5.9 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold ( 5.10 ) Local irritation: Burning and abnormal taste can occur ( 5.11 ) 5.1\tMyocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of TOSYMRA is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists, including TOSYMRA, may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving TOSYMRA. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, TOSYMRA is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of TOSYMRA in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following administration of TOSYMRA. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of TOSYMRA. 5.2\tArrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue TOSYMRA if these disturbances occur. TOSYMRA is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3\tChest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of TOSYMRA is contraindicated in patients shown to have CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4\tCerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue TOSYMRA if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. TOSYMRA is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5\tOther Vasospasm Reactions TOSYMRA may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional TOSYMRA. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6\tMedication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7\tSerotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with TOSYMRA, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue TOSYMRA if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Drug Interactions (7.4) ] 5.8\tIncrease in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with TOSYMRA. TOSYMRA is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9\tHypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. TOSYMRA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10\tSeizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. TOSYMRA should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. 5.11\tLocal Irritation Local irritative symptoms were reported in approximately 46% of patients treated with TOSYMRA in an open-label trial which allowed repeated use of TOSYMRA over the course of 6 months. Of these, the most common local irritative symptoms were application site reaction (36%), dysgeusia (21%), and throat irritation (5%). Approximately 0.5% of the cases were reported as severe.",
    "adverseReactions": "6\tADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Myocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Cerebrovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Other Vasospasm Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Medication Overuse Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Increase in Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Local Irritation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Most common adverse reactions (≥5% and > placebo) with sumatriptan injection were tingling, dizziness/vertigo, warm/hot sensation, burning sensation, feeling of heaviness, pressure sensation, flushing, feeling of tightness, and numbness ( 6.1 ) Additional common adverse reactions with TOSYMRA include application site reactions, dysgeusia, and throat irritation.

Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials with Sumatriptan Injection Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with migraine (Studies 2 and 3) following either a single 6 mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1. Table 1:\tAdverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials in Patients with Migraine (Studies 2 and 3) Adverse Reaction Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg Subcutaneous (n = 547) % Placebo (n = 370) % Atypical sensations 42 9 Tingling 14 3 Warm/hot sensation 11 4 Burning sensation 7 <1 Feeling of heaviness 7 1 Pressure sensation 7 2 Feeling of tightness 5 <1 Numbness 5 2 Feeling strange 2 <1 Tight feeling in head 2 <1 Cardiovascular Flushing 7 2 Chest discomfort 5 1 Tightness in chest 3 <1 Pressure in chest 2 <1 Ear, nose, and throat Throat discomfort 3 <1 Discomfort: nasal cavity/sinuses 2 <1 Miscellaneous Jaw discomfort 2 0 Musculoskeletal Weakness 5 <1 Neck pain/stiffness 5 <1 Myalgia 2 <1 Neurological Dizziness/vertigo 12 4 Drowsiness/sedation 3 2 Headache 2 <1 Skin Sweating 2 1 The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Adverse Reactions in Studies with TOSYMRA In an open-label study that was designed to evaluate the local tolerability of TOSYMRA, repeated use of TOSYMRA was allowed over the course of 6 months. In this study, local irritative symptoms were reported in approximately 46% of patients treated with TOSYMRA, the most common of which were application site reactions (e.g., burning sensations in the nose), dysgeusia, and throat irritation [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] 6.2\tPost-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular : Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological : Dystonia, tremor."
