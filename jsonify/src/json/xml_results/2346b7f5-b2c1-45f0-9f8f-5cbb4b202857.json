    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE OSENI is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. OSENI is a combination of alogliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione agonist of peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma, indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: OSENI is not recommended for use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use OSENI is not recommended for use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS OSENI is contraindicated in patients with: Established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure at the time of OSENI initiation [see . Boxed Warning ] A history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to alogliptin, pioglitazone, or any of the excipients in OSENI. Reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Adverse reactions (6.2) ] In patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure at the time of OSENI initiation. ( 4 ) In patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to alogliptin, pioglitazone, or any of the excipients in OSENI. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Consider the risks and benefits of OSENI prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.1 ) Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue OSENI. ( 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In such cases, promptly discontinue OSENI. ( 5.3 ) Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt OSENI and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart OSENI if liver injury is confirmed and no alternative etiology can be found. Use with caution in patients with liver disease. ( 5.4 ) Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. ( 5.5 ) Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. ( 5.6 ) Urinary bladder tumors: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. ( 5.7 ) Hypoglycemia: Consider a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue  to reduce risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with OSENI. ( 5.8 ) Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. ( 5.9 ) Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue if appropriate. ( 5.10 ) Bullous pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue OSENI. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Alogliptin In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and recent acute coronary syndrome, 106 (3.9%) of patients treated with alogliptin and 89 (3.3%) of patients treated with placebo were hospitalized for congestive heart failure. Pioglitazone Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure [see . Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Consider the risks and benefits of OSENI prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment. Observe these patients for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Advise patients about the symptoms of congestive heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If congestive heart failure develops while taking OSENI, consider discontinuation of OSENI or dosage reduction of pioglitazone in OSENI . (6.1) ] 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, acute pancreatitis was reported in 6 (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 2 (<0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes  mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in 10 (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in 7 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using OSENI . After initiation of OSENI, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, OSENI should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with alogliptin [see These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue OSENI, assess for other potential causes for the event and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema with another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with OSENI. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone or alogliptin, although some of the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] In glycemic control trials of alogliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 1.3% of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 1.7% of patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 1.8% of patients treated with placebo. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (ALT, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating OSENI therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, OSENI should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have clinically significant liver enzyme elevations (serum ALT greater than three times the ULN) and if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, OSENI should be interrupted, and an investigation done to establish the probable cause. OSENI should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. 5.5 Edema In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening of edema have been received. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. OSENI should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, OSENI should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with OSENI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see , Boxed Warning . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 5.6 Fractures In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5,238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N=2,605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2,633) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%). The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.7 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see . In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2,605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2,633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and 2 (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo [Hazard Ratio (HR) =1.00; (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.59, 1.72)]. Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective 10 year observational cohort study conducted in the United States (U.S.) found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone [HR = 1.06 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.26)]. A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer [HR = 1.63; (95% CI: 1.22, 2.19)]. Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10-year observational study in the U.S., but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, OSENI should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with OSENI should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.8 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas, are known to cause hypoglycemia. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with OSENI [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] 5.9 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of their thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.10 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.11 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving OSENI. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, OSENI should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

Alogliptin and Pioglitazone Over 1,500 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have received alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone in four large, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials [see . The mean exposure to alogliptin and pioglitazone was 29 weeks with more than 100 subjects treated for more than one year. The studies consisted of two placebo-controlled studies of 16 to 26 weeks in duration and two active-controlled studies of 26 weeks and 52 weeks in duration. In the alogliptin and pioglitazone arm, the mean duration of diabetes was approximately six years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m Clinical Studies (14) ] 2 (54% of patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ), and the mean age was 54 years (16% of patients ≥65 years of age). In a pooled analysis of these four controlled clinical studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 65% in patients treated with alogliptin and pioglitazone compared to 57% treated with placebo. Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 2.5% with alogliptin and pioglitazone compared to 2.0% with placebo, 3.7% with pioglitazone or 1.3% with alogliptin. Adverse reactions reported in ≥4% of patients treated with alogliptin and pioglitazone and more frequently than in patients who received alogliptin, pioglitazone or placebo are summarized in Table 2 . Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥4% of Patients Treated with Alogliptin and Pioglitazone and More Frequently than in Patients Receiving Either Alogliptin, Pioglitazone or Placebo Number of Patients (%) Alogliptin and pioglitazone Alogliptin and pioglitazone – includes data pooled for patients receiving alogliptin 25 mg and 12.5 mg combined with pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg Alogliptin Alogliptin – includes data pooled for patients receiving alogliptin 25 mg and 12.5 mg Pioglitazone Pioglitazone – includes data pooled for patients receiving pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg Placebo N=1533 N=446 N=949 N=153 Nasopharyngitis 75 (4.9) 21 (4.7) 37 (3.9) 6 (3.9) Back Pain 64 (4.2) 9 (2.0) 32 (3.4) 5 (3.3) Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 63 (4.1) 19 (4.3) 26 (2.7) 5 (3.3) Alogliptin Add-On Therapy to a Thiazolidinedione In a 26 week, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, patients inadequately controlled on a thiazolidinedione alone or in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea were treated with add-on alogliptin therapy or placebo; the adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients and more frequently than in patients who received placebo was influenza (alogliptin, 5.5%; placebo, 4.1%). Hypoglycemia In a 26 week, placebo-controlled factorial study with alogliptin in combination with pioglitazone on background therapy with metformin, the incidence of subjects reporting hypoglycemia was 0.8%, 0% and 3.8% for alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg, respectively; 2.3% for alogliptin 25 mg; 4.7%, 0.8% and 0.8% for pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg or 45 mg, respectively; and 0.8% for placebo. In a 26 week, active-controlled, double-blind study with alogliptin alone, pioglitazone alone or alogliptin coadministered with pioglitazone in patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 3% on alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg, 0.6% on alogliptin 25 mg and 1.8% on pioglitazone 30 mg. In a 52 week, active-controlled, double-blind study of alogliptin as add-on therapy to the combination of pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin compared to the titration of pioglitazone 30 mg to 45 mg and metformin, the incidence of subjects reporting hypoglycemia was 4.5% in the alogliptin 25 mg with pioglitazone 30 mg and metformin group versus 1.5% in the pioglitazone 45 mg and metformin group. Alogliptin A total of 14,778 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participated in 14 randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials of whom 9,052  subjects were treated with alogliptin, 3,469 subjects were treated with placebo and 2,257 were treated with an active comparator. The racial distribution of patients exposed to trial medication was 71% White, 17% Asian, 6% Black or African American, 2% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and 5% Multiracial or other racial groups. The ethnic distribution was 30% Hispanic or Latino and 70% was not Hispanic or Latino. The mean duration of diabetes was seven years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m 2 (49% of patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ) and the mean age was 58 years (26% of patients ≥65 years of age). The mean exposure to alogliptin was 49 weeks with 3,348 subjects treated for more than one year. In a pooled analysis of these 14 controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 73% in patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg compared to 75% with placebo and 70% with active comparator. Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 6.8% with alogliptin 25 mg compared to 8.4% with placebo or 6.2% with active comparator. Adverse reactions reported in ≥4% of adult  patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and more frequently than in patients who received placebo are summarized in Table 3 . Table 3. Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥4% Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treated with Alogliptin 25 mg and More Frequently Than in Patients Given Placebo in Pooled Trials Number of Patients (%) Alogliptin 25 mg Placebo Active Comparator N=6447 N=3469 N=2257 Nasopharyngitis 309 (5) 152 (4) 113 (5) Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 287 (5) 121 (4) 113 (5) Headache 278 (4) 101 (3) 121 (5) Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemic events were documented based upon a blood glucose value and/or clinical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In the monotherapy trial, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 1.5% in patients treated with alogliptin compared to 1.6% with placebo. The use of alogliptin as add-on therapy to glyburide or insulin did not increase the incidence of hypoglycemia compared to placebo. In a monotherapy trial comparing alogliptin to a sulfonylurea in elderly patients, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 5.4% with alogliptin compared to 26% with glipizide. In the EXAMINE trial, the incidence of investigator reported hypoglycemia was 6.7% in patients receiving alogliptin and 6.5% in patients receiving placebo. Serious adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported in 0.8% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 0.6% of patients treated with placebo. Renal Impairment In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 3.4% of patients treated with alogliptin and 1.3% of patients treated with placebo had renal function adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were renal impairment (0.5% for alogliptin and 0.1% for active comparators or placebo), decreased creatinine clearance (1.6% for alogliptin and 0.5% for active comparators or placebo) and increased blood creatinine (0.5% for alogliptin and 0.3% for active comparators or placebo) [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] In the EXAMINE trial of high CV risk type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, 23% of patients treated with alogliptin and 21% of patients treated with placebo had an investigator reported renal impairment adverse reaction. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were renal impairment (7.7% for alogliptin and 6.7% for placebo), decreased glomerular filtration rate (4.9% for alogliptin and 4.3% for placebo) and decreased renal clearance (2.2% for alogliptin and 1.8% for placebo). Laboratory measures of renal function were also assessed. Estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 25% or more in 21.1% of patients treated with alogliptin and 18.7% of patients treated with placebo. Worsening of chronic kidney disease stage was seen in 16.8% of patients treated with alogliptin and in 15.5% of patients treated with placebo. Pioglitazone Over 8,500 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2,605 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6,000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4,500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3,000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. Common Adverse Reactions: 16 to 26-Week Monotherapy Trials A summary of the incidence and type of common adverse reactions reported in three pooled 16 to 26 week placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of pioglitazone is provided in Table 4 . Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of >5% and more commonly in patients treated with pioglitazone than in patients who received placebo. None of these adverse reactions were related to pioglitazone dose. Table 4.

None of the reactions were fatal. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NYHA class II or early class III congestive heart failure were randomized to receive 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with either pioglitazone at daily doses of 30 mg to 45 mg (N=262) or glyburide at daily doses of 10 mg to 15 mg (N=256). A summary of the incidence of adverse reactions related to congestive heart failure reported in this study is provided in Table 5 . Table 5.

Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes mellitus of 9.5 years and mean A1C of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio = 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p=0.10). Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 7 . Table 7.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Edema Edema induced from taking pioglitazone is reversible when pioglitazone is discontinued. The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure. Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of pioglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date. One randomized, double-blind, three-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 (0.3%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 (0.9%) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with finger stick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial (15.7% versus 13.4%) and in the 24 week add-on to insulin trial (47.8% versus 43.5%). Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg (0.9%) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia (defined as causing considerable interference with patient’s usual activities) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea (N=2) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin (N=12). Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see During the three-year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2,605 (0.54%) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2,633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on pioglitazone and 2 (0.08%) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo (HR =1.00; 95% CI: 0.59-1.72) Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Laboratory Abnormalities Pioglitazone Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first four to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine (0.2%) patients treated with pioglitazone (values of 2,150 to 11,400 IU/L) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of alogliptin or pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Alogliptin Gastrointestinal Disorders: acute pancreatitis, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, ileus Hepatobiliary Disorders: fulminant hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis Investigations: hepatic enzyme elevations Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: severe and disabling arthralgia, rhabdomyolysis Renal and Urinary Disorders: tubulointerstitial nephritis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: angioedema, rash, urticaria and severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bullous pemphigoid Pioglitazone Cardiac Disorders: rapid increases in weight, edema, congestive heart failure both with and without previously known heart disease or concomitant insulin administration Eye Disorders: New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual  acuity Hepatobiliary Disorders: Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure"
