    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE OPSYNVI is a combination of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), and tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, indicated for chronic treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) in adult patients of WHO functional class (FC) II–III. ( 1.1 ) Individually, macitentan reduces the risk of clinical worsening events and hospitalization, and tadalafil improves exercise ability. ( 1.1 , 14 ) 1.1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension OPSYNVI is the combination of macitentan and tadalafil indicated for the chronic treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I and WHO Functional Class (FC) II–III). Individually, macitentan reduces the risk of clinical worsening events and hospitalization, and tadalafil improves exercise ability [see . Clinical Studies (14.1) ]",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy ( 4.1 ) Hypersensitivity ( 4.2 ) Concomitant Organic Nitrates ( 4.3 ) Concomitant Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators ( 4.4 ) 4.1 Pregnancy OPSYNVI may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. OPSYNVI is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. Macitentan was consistently shown to have teratogenic effects when administered to animals. If OPSYNVI is used during pregnancy, advise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 4.2 Hypersensitivity OPSYNVI is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to macitentan, tadalafil, or any component of the product. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported with tadalafil [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 4.3 Concomitant Organic Nitrates OPSYNVI is contraindicated in patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, either regularly or intermittently. Do not use nitrates within 48 hours of the last dose of OPSYNVI. Tadalafil potentiates the hypotensive effect of nitrates. This potentiation is thought to result from the combined effects of nitrates and tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 4.4 Concomitant Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators Coadministration of GC stimulators such as riociguat with OPSYNVI is contraindicated. Tadalafil may potentiate the hypotensive effects of GC stimulators.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: ERAs cause hepatotoxicity and liver failure. Obtain baseline liver enzymes and monitor as clinically indicated. ( 5.2 ) Hypotension: Vasodilatory effects may cause hypotension in susceptible patients. ( 5.3 ) Hemoglobin decrease. ( 5.4 ) Worsening Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease: If pulmonary edema is confirmed, discontinue treatment. ( 5.5 ) Visual Loss: Sudden loss of vision could be a sign of non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) and may be permanent. ( 5.6 ) Hearing Impairment: Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported in patients taking tadalafil. ( 5.7 ) Fluid Retention: Fluid retention may require intervention. ( 5.8 ) Combination with Other PDE5 Inhibitors: Avoid use with other PDE5 inhibitors. ( 5.9 ) Decreased Sperm Count: Decreases in sperm count have been observed in patients taking ERAs. ( 5.10 ) Prolonged Erection: Advise patients to seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts greater than 4 hours. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal reproduction studies, OPSYNVI may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant patient and is contraindicated during pregnancy. The available human data for ERAs do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects related to the use of OPSYNVI. Advise patients who can become pregnant of the potential risk to a fetus. Obtain a pregnancy test prior to initiation of therapy with OPSYNVI. Advise patients who can become pregnant to use effective contraceptive methods prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment, and for one month after discontinuation of treatment with OPSYNVI. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue use as soon as possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4.1) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity ERAs have caused elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure. The incidence of elevated aminotransferases in the double-blind and combined double-blind (DB)/open-label (OL) arms of the study of OPSYNVI in PAH are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Elevated Aminotransferases in the A DUE Study OPSYNVI DB (N=107) OPSYNVI DB/OL (N=185) ≥3 × ULN 1.0% 3.4% ≥8 × ULN 1.0% 1.1% The overall incidence of treatment discontinuations for hepatic adverse events in the double-blind and combined double-blind/open-label arms study of OPSYNVI in PAH data were 0.9% and 2.2% respectively. The incidence of elevated aminotransferases in the study of OPSUMIT (macitentan) in PAH is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Incidence of Elevated Aminotransferases in the SERAPHIN Study OPSUMIT 10 mg (N=242) Placebo (N=249) >3 × ULN 3.4% 4.5% >8 × ULN 2.1% 0.4% In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT, discontinuations for hepatic adverse events were 3.3% in the OPSUMIT 10 mg group vs. 1.6% for placebo. Obtain liver enzyme tests prior to initiation of OPSYNVI and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated. Advise patients to report symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, fever, or itching). If clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur, or if elevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin >2 × ULN, or by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity, discontinue OPSYNVI. Consider re-initiation of OPSYNVI when hepatic enzyme levels normalize in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Do not initiate OPSYNVI in patients with elevated aminotransferases (> 3 × upper limit of normal [ULN]) at baseline. Patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class C) have not been studied, and, therefore, avoid use of OPSYNVI. 5.3 Hypotension OPSYNVI tablets have vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. Prior to prescribing OPSYNVI tablets, carefully consider whether patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with pre-existing hypotension, with autonomic dysfunction, with left ventricular outflow obstruction, may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5.4 Hemoglobin Decrease Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have occurred following administration of other ERAs and were observed in clinical studies with OPSYNVI and OPSUMIT. These decreases occurred early and stabilized thereafter. In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, OPSUMIT 10 mg caused a mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to up to 18 months of about 1.0 g/dL compared to no change in the placebo group. A decrease in hemoglobin to below 10.0 g/dL was reported in 8.7% of the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and in 3.4% of the placebo group. Similar results were observed in the trial with OPSYNVI. Decreases in hemoglobin seldom require transfusion. Initiation of OPSYNVI is not recommended in patients with severe anemia. Measure hemoglobin prior to initiation of treatment and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.5 Worsening Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD) Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Since there are no clinical data on administration of OPSYNVI tablets to patients with veno-occlusive disease, administration of OPSYNVI tablets to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur when OPSYNVI tablets are administered, the possibility of associated PVOD should be considered. If confirmed, discontinue OPSYNVI. 5.6 Visual Loss Non–arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, has been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including: low cup to disc ratio (\"crowded disc\"), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5–11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged greater than or equal to 50 in the general population. Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of \"crowded\" optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use of OPSYNVI in these patients is not recommended. 5.7 Hearing Impairment Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in patients taking tadalafil. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors. 5.8 Fluid Retention Peripheral edema and fluid retention are known clinical consequences of PAH and known effects of ERAs and heart failure has been reported in patients taking OPSYNVI. In the active-controlled and combined double-blind/open-label arms of the study of OPSYNVI in PAH, the incidence of peripheral edema/fluid retention was 20.6% in the active-controlled and 17.3% in the double-blind/open-label arm [see . In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, the incidence of edema was 21.9% in the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and 20.5% in the placebo group. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Patients with underlying left ventricular dysfunction may be at particular risk for developing significant fluid retention after initiation of ERA treatment. In a small study of OPSUMIT in patients with pulmonary hypertension because of left ventricular dysfunction, more patients in the OPSUMIT group developed significant fluid retention and had more hospitalizations because of worsening heart failure compared to those randomized to placebo. Postmarketing cases of edema and fluid retention occurring within weeks of starting OPSUMIT, some requiring intervention with a diuretic or hospitalization for decompensated heart failure, have been reported . Monitor for signs of fluid retention after OPSYNVI initiation. If clinically significant fluid retention develops, evaluate the patient to determine the cause, such as OPSYNVI or underlying heart failure, and the possible need to discontinue OPSYNVI. 5.9 Combination with Other PDE5 Inhibitors Tadalafil is also indicated for erectile dysfunction. The safety and efficacy of taking tadalafil tablets together with another PDE5 inhibitors or other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Instruct patients taking OPSYNVI tablets not to take other PDE5 inhibitors. 5.10 Decreased Sperm Count Macitentan, like other ERAs, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis. Counsel men about potential effects on fertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.11 Prolonged Erection There have been reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for PDE5 inhibitors like tadalafil. Patients with conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease) are at an increased risk. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.2) ] Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Decrease in Hemoglobin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Visual Loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] Hearing loss [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Fluid Retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Prolonged Erection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Most common adverse reactions (≥10%) are edema/fluid retention, anemia, and headache/migraine. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen at 1-800-526-7736 (1-800-JANSSEN) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The overall safety profile of OPSYNVI is based on data from a double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 clinical study (A DUE) and an open-label extension study, in patients with PAH [see . In the double-blind portion of the study, a total of 107 patients were treated with OPSYNVI 10 mg/40 mg, 35 patients were treated with 10 mg macitentan monotherapy, and 44 patients were treated with 40 mg tadalafil monotherapy. The duration of exposure to OPSYNVI during the double-blind portion was 16 weeks. Clinical Studies (14) ] The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 10% of the OPSYNVI-treated patients) from the double-blind study data were edema/fluid retention (21%), anemia (19%), and headache/migraine (18%). The incidence of treatment discontinuations due to adverse events among patients receiving OPSYNVI in the double-blind phase of the study was 8%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were anemia and hemoglobin decreased (2% grouped) and peripheral edema and peripheral swelling (2% grouped). Table 3 presents adverse reactions seen in patients treated for 16 weeks during the double-blind portion of A DUE. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring in 3% or More of Patients Treated with OPSYNVI During the 16-week Double-blind Study Portion of A DUE Adverse Reaction OPSYNVI N=107 % Macitentan Monotherapy N=35 % Tadalafil Monotherapy N=44 % Edema/fluid retention 21 14 16 Anemia 19 3 2 Headache 18 17 14 Abdominal pain 7 3 14 Hypotension 7 0 0 Myalgia 6 0 5 Nasopharyngitis 6 3 0 Nausea 6 0 7 Increased uterine bleeding 5 0 0 Back pain 5 3 9 Flushing 4 6 0 Vomiting 4 0 5 Palpitations 4 3 5 Pain in extremity 3 0 7 Epistaxis 3 0 0 One-hundred eighty-five patients received OPSYNVI in the double-blind or open-label phase of the study. The median exposure to OPSYNVI during the combined double-blind/open-label extension was 59.9 weeks with a mean exposure of 63.2 weeks. Adverse reactions from the combined double-blind/open-label study data were similar to those observed in the double-blind study. The following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical trials with the individual components of OPSYNVI but were not observed in 3% or more of subjects treated with OPSYNVI in the A DUE clinical trial: Macitentan: bronchitis, pharyngitis, transaminases increased, influenza, urinary tract infection. Tadalafil: lower respiratory tract infection, prolonged erections, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vision blurred, tinnitus, swelling face, chest pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tadalafil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Macitentan: liver injury, symptomatic hypotension, hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, pruritus, and rash). Tadalafil: Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, and tachycardia; Nervous system events including, seizure, transient amnesia; Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis; visual field defect, NAION, retinal vascular occlusion; sudden hearing loss, priapism."
