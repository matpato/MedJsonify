    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PYLERA is a combination of metronidazole, a nitroimidazole antimicrobial, tetracycline,- a tetracycline class antimicrobial and bismuth subcitrate potassium, indicated for use, in combination with omeprazole, for the treatment of patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or history of within the past 5 years) to eradicate H. pylori. ( 1.1 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of PYLERA and other antibacterial drugs, PYLERA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.2 ) 1.1\tEradication of Helicobacter pylori in Patients with Active Duodenal Ulcer or History of Duodenal Ulcer Disease PYLERA in combination with omeprazole are indicated for the treatment of patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or history of within the past 5 years) to eradicate H. pylori .  The eradication of Helicobacter pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. 1.2\tUsage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of PYLERA and other antibacterial drugs, PYLERA should be used to treat only indicated infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.  When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.  In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Disulfiram usage within the last two weeks. ( 4.1 , 7.1 ) Alcoholic beverage consumption for at least three days during or after therapy. ( 4.2 , 7.2 ) Patients with Cockayne syndrome. ( 4.3 , 6.3 ) Severe renal impairment. ( 4.4 ) Women who are pregnant. ( 4.5 , 8.1 ) Known hypersensitivity to product components. ( 4.6 ) 4.1 Disulfiram PYLERA is contraindicated in patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks. Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients who are using metronidazole, a component of PYLERA, and disulfiram concurrently [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] 4.2 Alcohol Alcoholic beverages or other products containing propylene glycol should not be consumed during and for at least 3 days after therapy with PYLERA. A disulfiram-like reaction (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing) may occur due to the interaction between alcohol or propylene glycol and metronidazole, a component of PYLERA [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 4.3 Cockayne Syndrome PYLERA is contraindicated in patients with Cockayne syndrome. Severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure with fatal outcomes have been reported after initiation of metronidazole in patients with Cockayne syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ]. 4.4 Severe Renal Impairment PYLERA is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.  The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) [see . In patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum concentrations of tetracyclines may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] 4.5 Pregnancy PYLERA is contraindicated during pregnancy [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 4.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions PYLERA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g. urticaria, erythematous rash, flushing, and fever) to bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives, or tetracycline [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) ].",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fetal Toxicity: Advise pregnant women of the risk throughout pregnancy for retardation of skeletal development seen in animal studies and permanent discoloration of teeth with tetracycline if used during the second or third trimester. ( 5.2 , 8.1 ) Maternal Toxicity: Risk of hepatotoxicity in pregnant women with high doses of intravenous tetracycline also resulting in stillborn or premature birth. ( 5.3 , 8.1 ) Tooth Enamel discoloration and hypoplasia: permanent discoloration may develop with use during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years). ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with metronidazole. If symptoms or signs of SCARs develop, discontinue PYLERA immediately and institute appropriate therapy. ( 5.5 ) Central and Peripheral Nervous System Effects: encephalopathy, convulsive seizures, aseptic meningitis and peripheral neuropathy with metronidazole, intracranial hypertension with tetracycline and neurotoxicity with bismuth-containing products. Monitor patients with CNS conditions closely and discontinue promptly if abnormal neurologic signs develop. ( 5.6 ) Photosensitivity: avoid exposure to sun and sun lamps. ( 5.8 ) Blood Dyscrasias: Use with caution in patients with a history of blood dyscrasias. ( 5.10 ) Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 5.11 ) 5.1\tPotential for Carcinogenicity Metronidazole, a component of PYLERA, has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats. Tumors affecting the liver, lungs, mammary and lymphatic tissues have been detected in several studies of metronidazole in rats and mice, but not hamsters [see .  It is unknown whether metronidazole is associated with carcinogenicity in humans. Nonclinical Toxicology (13) ] 5.2\tFetal Toxicity Tetracycline can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on animal data, use of drugs of the tetracycline class during the second and third trimester of pregnancy can cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray brown) and possibly inhibit bone development [see . Administration of oral tetracycline to pregnant rats at various doses resulted in yellow fluorescence in teeth and bones in the newborn animals. If PYLERA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking PYLERA, advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] [see . Contraindications (4.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 5.3\tMaternal Toxicity Tetracycline, a component of PYLERA, administered during pregnancy at high doses (> 2 g IV) was associated with rare but serious cases of maternal hepatotoxicity. This syndrome may result in stillborn or premature birth due to maternal pathology [see . Contraindications (4.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 5.4\tTooth Enamel Discoloration and Hypoplasia The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown).  This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug, but has been observed following repeated short-term courses.  Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. PYLERA, therefore, should not be used in this age group unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.5\tSevere Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Metronidazole : Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of metronidazole. Symptoms can be serious and potentially life threatening. If symptoms or signs of SCARs develop, discontinue PYLERA capsules immediately and institute appropriate therapy. Tetracycline : Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with tetracycline and have been associated with worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalize bullous fixed drug eruption [see . If severe skin reactions occur, Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] discontinue PYLERA immediately, and institute appropriate therapy. 5.6\tCentral and Peripheral Nervous System Effects Metronidazole : Convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis and peripheral neuropathy (including optic neuropathy) have been reported. Encephalopathy has been reported in association with cerebellar toxicity characterized by ataxia, dizziness, and dysarthria.  CNS lesions seen on MRI have been described in reports of encephalopathy.  CNS symptoms are generally reversible within days to weeks upon discontinuation of metronidazole. CNS lesions seen on MRI have also been described as reversible. Peripheral neuropathy, mainly of sensory type has been reported and is characterized by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. Aseptic meningitis symptoms may occur within hours of dose administration and generally resolve after metronidazole therapy is discontinued. Tetracycline : Intracranial hypertension (IH), including pseudotumor cerebri, has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause IH. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation, patients should be monitored until they stabilize. Bismuth-containing products: Cases of neurotoxicity associated with excessive doses of various bismuth-containing products have been reported. Effects have been reversible with discontinuation of bismuth therapy. The appearance of abnormal neurologic signs and symptoms demands the prompt evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio of the continuation of PYLERA therapy [see . Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] 5.7\tDevelopment of Potential for Microbial Overgrowth Known or previously unrecognized candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with metronidazole and requires treatment with an antifungal agent. As with other antibacterial drugs, use of tetracycline hydrochloride may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi.  If superinfection occurs, discontinue PYLERA and institute appropriate therapy. 5.8\tPhotosensitivity Photosensitivity, manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction, has been observed in patients taking tetracycline [see .  Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs.  Instruct patients taking PYLERA to avoid exposure to the sun or sun lamps.  Discontinue treatment at the first evidence of skin erythema. Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] 5.9\tDarkening of the Tongue and/or Black Stool Bismuth subcitrate potassium may cause temporary and harmless darkening of the tongue and/or black stools, generally reversible within several days after treatment is stopped [see .  Stool darkening should not be confused with melena. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.10\tUse in Patients with Blood Dyscrasias Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole, and should be used with care in patients with evidence of or history of blood dyscrasia. A mild leukopenia has been observed during its administration; however, no persistent hematologic abnormalities attributable to metronidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended before and after therapy [see . Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] 5.11\tIncreased Drug Plasma Concentrations in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment metabolize metronidazole slowly, with resultant accumulation of metronidazole in the plasma. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events. PYLERA is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see . Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.12\tLaboratory Test Interactions Bismuth absorbs x-rays and may interfere with x-ray diagnostic procedures of the gastrointestinal tract. Bismuth subcitrate potassium may cause a temporary and harmless darkening of the stool.  However, this change does not interfere with standard tests for occult blood. Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and hexokinase glucose.  Values of zero may be observed.  All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide (NAD+ <=> NADH). Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole (322 nm) at pH 7. 5.13\tDevelopment of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing PYLERA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.14\tDrug Interactions Oral Contraceptives Concurrent use of PYLERA with oral contraceptive may make oral contraceptives less effective due to an interaction with the tetracycline component of PYLERA. Breakthrough bleeding has been reported. Advise women of child-bearing potential to use a different or additional form of contraception while taking PYLERA [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . Anticoagulants PYLERA may alter the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and other oral coumarin anticoagulants. Metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, and other oral coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. Tetracycline has been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity. Closely monitor prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests if PYLERA is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding [see . Drug Interactions (7.4) ] Lithium In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term use of PYLERA may cause elevation of serum lithium concentrations and signs of lithium toxicity due to the interaction between metronidazole and lithium. Monitor serum lithium and serum creatinine concentrations daily for several days after beginning treatment with PYLERA to detect any increase that may precede clinical symptoms of lithium toxicity [see . Drug Interactions (7.5) ] Busulfan Metronidazole has been reported to increase plasma concentrations of busulfan, which can result in an increased risk for serious busulfan toxicity. Do not administer PYLERA concomitantly with busulfan unless the benefit outweighs the risk. If no therapeutic alternatives to PYLERA are available, and concomitant administration with busulfan is medically needed, monitor for busulfan toxicity and busulfan plasma concentrations and adjust the busulfan dose accordingly [see . Drug Interactions (7.7) ] Drugs that Prolong the QT interval QT prolongation has been reported with metronidazole, a component of PYLERA, particularly when administered with drugs with the potential for prolonging the QT interval.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥5%): abnormal feces, diarrhea, nausea, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact H2-Pharma, LLC at 1-833-520-8580 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of PYLERA plus omeprazole (OBMT) to eradicate Helicobacter pylori was assessed in an open-label, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial conducted in North America. The duration of treatment was 10 days with 147 patients exposed to PYLERA plus omeprazole (OBMT) and 152 exposed to control, consisting of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (OAC). The age of the population in the study ranged from 18 to 75 years, with 59% male patients and 59% Caucasian patients. Adverse drug reactions were reported in 58% of patients in the OBMT group and 59% of patients in the OAC group. There were no adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of the study during the clinical trial. Adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥ 5% in OBMT group include abnormal feces, diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Adverse drug reactions with an incidence of ≥ 5% in OAC group include diarrhea, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, nausea and headache.
