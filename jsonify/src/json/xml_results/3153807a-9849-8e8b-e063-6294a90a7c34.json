    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate Injection, after radiolabeling with Technetium Tc 99m, is indicated for Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate Injection. Technetium Tc 99m pentetate is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for: Brain imaging in adults ( 1.1 ). Renal visualization, assessment of renal perfusion, and estimation of glomerular filtration rate in adult and pediatric patients ( 1.2 ). Lung ventilation imaging and evaluation of pulmonary embolism when paired with perfusion imaging in adult and pediatric patients ( 1.3 ). 1.1 Brain Imaging Brain imaging in adults by intravenous administration. 1.2 Renal Scintigraphy Renal visualization, assessment of renal perfusion, and estimation of glomerular filtration rate in adult and pediatric patients by intravenous administration. 1.3 Lung Ventilation Imaging Lung ventilation imaging and evaluation of pulmonary embolism when paired with perfusion imaging in adult and pediatric patients when administered by nebulizer for inhalation.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or to any component of the product [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any component of this product ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-approval diagnostic use of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate injection. Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions ( 5.1 ). Image interpretation risks in lung ventilation studies: If proximal airway deposition is observed, consider additional diagnostic options ( 5.2 ). Radiation exposure risk: Technetium Tc 99m pentetate contributes to a patient’s overall long-term radiation exposure ( 2.1 , 2.3 , 5.3 ). Bronchospasm in lung ventilation studies: Inhalation of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate solution may result in acute bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with heightened bronchoreactivity ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-approval diagnostic use of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate injection. Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions and have access to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and personnel. 5.2 Image Interpretation Risks in Lung Ventilation Studies In patients with obstructive pulmonary disease there may be deposition of particles in the proximal airways influencing image quality and interfering with diagnostic interpretation, therefore to ensure diagnostic quality, careful use of the nebulizer to assure optimal particle delivery is essential. If interfering particle deposition occurs, consider additional diagnostic options. 5.3 Radiation Exposure Risk Technetium Tc 99m contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Use the lowest dose of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate necessary for imaging. Encourage patients to drink fluids and void as frequently as possible after intravenous administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 ) ] . Radiation risks associated with the use of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate are greater in pediatric patients than in adults due to greater radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy. 5.4 Bronchospasm in Lung Ventilation Studies As with other inhaled medications, inhalation of Technetium Tc 99m pentetate solution may result in acute bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with heightened bronchoreactivity, such as patients with asthma or other lung or allergic disorders. Monitor all patients for bronchoconstriction.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified post-approval. Because these reactions are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their exact frequency or establish a causal relationship to Technetium Tc 99m pentetate exposure. Adverse reactions are presented in decreasing order of reported frequency: Immune system disorders: allergic reaction, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash, itching, hives, erythema. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: throat irritation, wheezing. Vascular disorders: hypotension, hypertension. Nervous system disorders: headache, fainting, dizziness. General disorders and administration site conditions: chills. Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, vomiting. Cardiac disorders: cyanosis, tachycardia. Most common adverse reactions reported with Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate Injection include allergic reactions, rash, itching ( 6 ).
