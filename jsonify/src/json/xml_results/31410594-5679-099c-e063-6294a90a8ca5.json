    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Irbesartan tablet is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: • Treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.1 ) • Treatment of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, an elevated serum creatinine, and proteinuria. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Hypertension Irbesartan tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Irbesartan tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Irbesartan tablets are indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, an elevated serum creatinine, and proteinuria (>300 mg/day). In this population, irbesartan reduces the rate of progression of nephropathy as measured by the occurrence of doubling of serum creatinine or end-stage renal disease (need for dialysis or renal transplantation) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )].",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Irbesartan tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. Do not co-administrate aliskiren with irbesartan tablets in patients with diabetes. • Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. ( 4 ) • Co-administration with aliskiren in patients with diabetes. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration. ( 5.2 ) • Monitor renal function and serum potassium. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Irbesartan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue irbesartan tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics),  symptomatic hypotension may occur after initialization of treatment with irbesartan. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of irbesartan or use a lower starting dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.3 Impaired Renal Function Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure or death on irbesartan. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on irbesartan [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: •   Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-depleted Patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] •   Impaired Renal Function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients: The most common adverse reactions which were more frequent than placebo were hyperkalemia dizziness, orthostatic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. Hypertension Irbesartan has been evaluated for safety in more than 4300 patients with hypertension and about 5000 subjects overall. This experience includes 1303 patients treated for over 6 months and 407 patients for 1 year or more. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 1% of patients treated with irbesartan (n=1965) and at a higher incidence versus placebo (n=641), excluding those too general to be informative and those not reasonably associated with the use of drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population, include: diarrhea (3% vs 2%), dyspepsia/heartburn (2% vs 1%), and fatigue (4% vs 3%). Irbesartan use was not associated with an increased incidence of dry cough, as is typically associated with ACE inhibitor use. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of cough in irbesartan-treated patients was 2.8% versus 2.7% in patients receiving placebo. Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Hyperkalemia: In the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) (proteinuria ≥900 mg/day, and serum creatinine ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/dL), the percent of patients with potassium>6.0 mEq/L was 18.6% in the irbesartan group versus 6.0% in the placebo group. Discontinuations due to hyperkalemia in the irbesartan group were 2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group. In IDNT, the adverse reactions were similar to those seen in patients with hypertension with the exception of an increased incidence of orthostatic symptoms which occurred more frequently in the irbesartan versus placebo group: dizziness (10.2% vs 6.0%), orthostatic dizziness (5.4% vs 2.7%) and orthostatic hypotension (5.4% vs 3.2%). 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of irbesartan. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Urticaria; angioedema (involving swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue); anaphylactic reaction including anaphylactic shock; increased liver function tests; jaundice; hepatitis; hyperkalemia; anemia; thrombocytopenia; increased cpk; tinnitus ; and hypoglycemia in diabetic patients."
