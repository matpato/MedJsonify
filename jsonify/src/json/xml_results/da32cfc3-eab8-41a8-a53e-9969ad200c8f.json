    "contraindications": "4  CONTRAINDICATIONS VYVGART HYTRULO is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to efgartigimod alfa products, to hyaluronidase, or to any of the excipients of VYVGART HYTRULO.  Reactions have included anaphylaxis and hypotension leading to syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. VYVGART HYTRULO is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to efgartigimod alfa products, to hyaluronidase, or to any of the excipients of VYVGART HYTRULO. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections: Delay administration of VYVGART HYTRULO to patients with an active infection. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection in patients treated with VYVGART HYTRULO. If serious infection occurs, administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding VYVGART HYTRULO until the infection has resolved. ( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylaxis, hypotension leading to syncope,  angioedema, dyspnea, rash, and urticaria have occurred in patients treated with VYVGART HYTRULO or intravenous efgartigimod alfa-fcab product. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the healthcare professional should institute appropriate measures if needed or the patient should seek medical attention. ( 4 , 5.2 ) Infusion/injection-Related Reactions: If a severe infusion/injection-related reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy; consider the risks and benefits of readministering.  If a mild to moderate infusion/injection-related reaction occurs, may rechallenge with close clinical observation, slower infusion/injection rates, and pre-medications. ( 5.3 ) 5.1  Infections VYVGART HYTRULO may increase the risk of infection. The most common infections observed in Study 1 were urinary tract infection (10% of efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients) and respiratory tract infections (33% of efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients compared to 29% of placebo-treated patients) [see . A higher frequency of patients who received efgartigimod alfa-fcab compared to placebo were observed to have below normal levels for white blood cell counts (12% versus 5%, respectively), lymphocyte counts (28% versus 19%, respectively), and neutrophil counts (13% versus 6%, respectively).  The majority of infections and hematologic abnormalities were mild to moderate in severity. Delay VYVGART HYTRULO administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. During treatment with VYVGART HYTRULO, monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of infections. If serious infection occurs, administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding VYVGART HYTRULO until the infection has resolved. Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] Immunization Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART HYTRULO. The safety of immunization with live vaccines and the immune response to vaccination during treatment with VYVGART HYTRULO are unknown. Because VYVGART HYTRULO causes a reduction in IgG levels, vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART HYTRULO. 5.2  Hypersensitivity Reactions In clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, angioedema, and dyspnea were observed in patients treated with VYVGART HYTRULO or intravenous efgartigimod alfa-fcab. Urticaria was also observed in patients treated with VYVGART HYTRULO. Hypersensitivity reactions were mild or moderate, occurred within one hour to three weeks of administration. Anaphylaxis and hypotension leading to syncope have been reported in postmarketing experience with intravenous efgartigimod alfa-fcab.  Anaphylaxis and hypotension occurred during or within an hour of administration and led to infusion discontinuation and in some cases to permanent treatment discontinuation. Monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions for at least 30 minutes after administration [see . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the healthcare professional should institute appropriate measures if needed or the patient should seek medical attention. VYVGART HYTRULO is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity to efgartigimod alfa products, to hyaluronidase, or to any of the excipients of VYVGART HYTRULO Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.3\tInfusion/Injection-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions have been reported with intravenous efgartigimod alfa-fcab in postmarketing experience. The most frequent symptoms and signs were hypertension, chills, shivering, and thoracic, abdominal, and back pain. Infusion-related reactions occurred during or within an hour of administration and led to infusion discontinuation. If a severe infusion/injection-related reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy.  Consider the risks and benefits of readministering VYVGART HYTRULO following a severe infusion/injection-related reaction. If a mild to moderate infusion/injection-related reaction occurs, patients may be rechallenged with close clinical observation, slower infusion/injection rates, and pre-medications.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Infusion/Injection-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) in patients with gMG treated with efgartigimod alfa-fcab were respiratory tract infections, headache, and urinary tract infection. Injection site reactions were common (≥ 15%) in patients with gMG and CIDP who were treated with VYVGART HYTRULO  ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact argenx at 1-833-argx411 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1  Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Experience in Patients with gMG The safety of efgartigimod alfa in patients with gMG was established in a double blinded placebo-controlled study with efgartigimod alfa-fcab administered intravenously (Study 1) and its open-label extension, and in an active-controlled study of VYVGART HYTRULO administered subcutaneously (Study 2) and its open-label extension [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Adverse Reactions with Efgartigimod Alfa-fcab Intravenous in Patients with gMG In clinical studies, the safety of efgartigimod alfa-fcab administered intravenously has been evaluated in 246 patients with gMG who received at least one dose of efgartigimod alfa-fcab, including 57 patients exposed to at least 7 treatment cycles and 8 patients exposed to at least 10 treatment cycles. In a placebo-controlled study (Study 1) in patients with gMG, 84 patients received efgartigimod alfa-fcab 10 mg/kg [see . Of these 84 patients, approximately 75% were female, 82% were White, 11% were Asian, and 8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean age at study entry was 46 years (range 19 to 78). Clinical Studies (14) ] The minimum time to initiate a subsequent cycle, specified by study protocol, was 50 days from the start of the previous treatment cycle. On average, efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients received 2 cycles in Study 1. The mean and median times to the second treatment cycle were 94 days and 72 days from the initial infusion of the first treatment cycle, respectively, for efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients. Adverse reactions reported in at least 5% of patients treated with efgartigimod alfa-fcab and more frequently than placebo are summarized in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients) were respiratory tract infection, headache, and urinary tract infection. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in at least 5% of Patients with gMG Treated with Efgartigimod Alfa-fcab Intravenously (EFG IV) and More Frequently than in Placebo-Treated Patients in Study 1 (Safety Population) Adverse reaction EFG IV (N=84) % Placebo (N=83) % Respiratory tract infection 33 29 Headache Headache includes migraine and procedural headache. 32 29 Urinary tract infection 10 5 Paraesthesia Paresthesia includes oral hypoesthesia, hypoesthesia, and hyperesthesia. 7 5 Myalgia 6 1 Adverse Reactions with VYVGART HYTRULO in Patients with gMG In an active-controlled study in patients with gMG (Study 2), 110 patients were randomized and received one cycle of once weekly administrations for 4 weeks (4 administrations total), of either VYVGART HYTRULO subcutaneously (n=55) or efgartigimod alfa-fcab intravenously (n=55) at recommended doses [see . The open-label extension of Study 2 included some patients who switched from efgartigimod alfa-fcab IV to VYVGART HYTRULO. Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of VYVGART HYTRULO-treated patients) were injection site reactions and headache. In Study 2, injection site reactions occurred in 38% of patients receiving VYVGART HYTRULO. These were injection site rash, erythema, pruritus, bruising, pain, and urticaria. In Study 2 and its open-label extension (n = 168), all injection site reactions were mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. The majority occurred within 24 hours after administration and resolved spontaneously. Most injection site reactions occurred during the first treatment cycle, and the incidence decreased with each subsequent cycle. Clinical Experience in Patients with CIDP Adverse Reactions with VYVGART HYTRULO in Patients with CIDP In a placebo-controlled study in patients with CIDP (Study 3, stage B), 221 patients were randomized to receive once-weekly administration of either VYVGART HYTRULO 1,008 mg /11, 200 units subcutaneously (n=111) or placebo (n=110) [see The mean duration of treatment with VYVGART HYTRULO in stage B was 25 weeks. The overall safety profile observed in patients with CIDP treated with VYVGART HYTRULO was consistent with the known safety profile of VYVGART HYTRULO and of efgartigimod alfa-fcab administered intravenously. Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. In Study 3, injection site reactions occurred in 15% of patients treated with VYVGART HYTRULO compared to 6% of patients who received placebo. The most common of these injection site reactions were injection site bruising and injection site erythema. All injection site reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Most injection site reactions occurred during the first 3 months of treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of efgartigimod alfa products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and hypotension, and infusion/injection-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3) ]."
