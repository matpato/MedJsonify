    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS EZALLOR SPRINKLE is contraindicated in patients with: Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin or any excipients in EZALLOR SPRINKLE. Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema, have been reported with EZALLOR SPRINKLE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis. (4) Hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin or any excipients in EZALLOR SPRINKLE. (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage. Asian patients may be at higher risk for myopathy. Discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE  in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. (5.1) Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE if IMNM is suspected. (5.2) Hepatic Dysfunction : Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE. (5.3) 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis EZALLOR SPRINKLE may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including EZALLOR SPRINKLE. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage. Asian patients on EZALLOR SPRINKLE may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8)]. The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking EZALLOR SPRINKLE 40 mg daily compared with lower EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosages. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of EZALLOR SPRINKLE with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if EZALLOR SPRINKLE is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the EZALLOR SPRINKLE dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of EZALLOR SPRINKLE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1.1% of patients taking EZALLOR SPRINKLE versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with EZALLOR Sprinkle. There have been rare postmarketing reports  of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including EZALLOR SPRINKLE. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Consider liver enzyme testing before EZALLOR SPRINKLE initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. EZALLOR SPRINKLE is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications (4) ]. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue EZALLOR SPRINKLE. 5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the rosuvastatin clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin or comparator statins, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, consider a dose reduction for patients on EZALLOR SPRINKLE therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing. 5.5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including EZALLOR SPRINKLE. Based on clinical trial data with EZALLOR SPRINKLE, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Proteinuria and Hematuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Most frequent adverse reactions (rate ≥ 2%) are headache, nausea, myalgia, asthenia, and constipation.

Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2. These studies had a treatment duration of up to 12 weeks. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 2% of Patients Treated with Rosuvastatin and > Placebo in Placebo-Controlled Trials Adverse Reactions Placebo N=382 % Rosuvastatin 5 mg N=291 % Rosuvastatin 10 mg N=283 % Rosuvastatin 20 mg N=64 % Rosuvastatin 40 mg N=106 % Total Rosuvastatin 5 mg to 40 mg N=744 % Headache 5 5.5 4.9 3.1 8.5 5.5 Nausea 3.1 3.8 3.5 6.3 0 3.4 Myalgia 1.3 3.1 2.1 6.3 1.9 2.8 Asthenia 2.6 2.4 3.2 4.7 0.9 2.7 Constipation 2.4 2.1 2.1 4.7 2.8 2.4 Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies were abdominal pain, dizziness, hypersensitivity (including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema) and pancreatitis. The following laboratory abnormalities have also been reported: dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria; elevated creatine phosphokinase, transaminases, glucose, glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin; and thyroid function abnormalities. In the METEOR study, patients were treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg (n=700) or placebo (n=281) with a mean treatment duration of 1.7 years. Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 3.

In JUPITER, there was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c >6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 4.

Four of 130 (3%) patients treated with rosuvastatin (2 treated with 10 mg and 2 treated with 20 mg) had increased CK greater than 10 x ULN, compared to 0 of 46 patients on placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of rosuvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood Disorders : thrombocytopenia Hepatobiliary Disorders : hepatitis, jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Musculoskeletal Disorders : arthralgia, rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use Nervous System Disorders : peripheral neuropathy, rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, and confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Psychiatric Disorders : depression, sleep disorders (including insomnia and nightmares) Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : gynecomastia Respiratory Disorders : interstitial lung disease Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), lichenoid drug eruption"
