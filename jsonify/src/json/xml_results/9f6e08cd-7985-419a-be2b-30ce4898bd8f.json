    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection is indicated to raise blood pressure in adult patients with severe, acute hypotension. Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection is a catecholamine indicated for restoration of blood pressure in adult patients with acute hypotensive states. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None. • None.  ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Tissue Ischemia : Infuse Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection into a large vein. To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in with extravasation, infiltrate the area with an adrenergic blocking agent in saline. ( 5.1 ) • Hypotension After Abrupt Discontinuation: Gradually taper a norepinephrine infusion to prevent hypotension. ( 5.2 ) • Cardiac Arrhythmias: Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection may cause arrhythmias. Monitor cardiac function in patients with underlying heart disease. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Tissue Ischemia Administration of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection to patients who are hypotensive from hypovolemia can result in severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and reduced urine output, tissue hypoxia, lactic acidosis, and reduced systemic blood flow despite “normal” blood pressure. Address hypovolemia prior to initiating Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection [see Avoid Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection in patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis, as this may increase ischemia and extend the area of infarction. Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Gangrene of the extremities has occurred in patients with occlusive or thrombotic vascular disease or who received prolonged or high dose infusions. Monitor for changes to the skin of the extremities in susceptible patients. Extravasation of Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. To reduce the risk of extravasation, infuse into a large vein, check the infusion site frequently for free flow, and monitor for signs of extravasation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Emergency Treatment of Extravasation To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has occurred, infiltrate the ischemic area as soon as possible, using a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle with 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate in 10 to 15 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection in adults. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.2 Hypotension after Abrupt Discontinuation Sudden cessation of the infusion rate may result in marked hypotension. When discontinuing the infusion, gradually reduce the Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Norepinephrine Bitartrate in Dextrose Injection elevates intracellular calcium concentrations and may cause arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of hypoxia or hypercarbia. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring of patients with arrhythmias.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections: • Tissue Ischemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Cardiac Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions are hypertension and bradycardia. The following adverse reactions can occur: Nervous system disorders: Anxiety, headache Respiratory disorders: Respiratory difficulty, pulmonary edema General disorders and administration site conditions : Extravasation, injection site necrosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Serious adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 , & 5.3 )]. Most common adverse reactions are hypertension, bradycardia, ischemic injury, anxiety, headache, respiratory difficulty, pulmonary edema, and extravasation necrosis at injection site.
