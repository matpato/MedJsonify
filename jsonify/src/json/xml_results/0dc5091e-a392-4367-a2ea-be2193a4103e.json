    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE NURTEC ODT is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist indicated for the: • acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults ( 1.1 ) • preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Acute Treatment of Migraine NURTEC ODT is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults . 1.2 Preventive Treatment of Episodic Migraine NURTEC ODT is indicated for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS NURTEC ODT is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to rimegepant, NURTEC ODT, or any of its components. Delayed serious hypersensitivity has occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to rimegepant, NURTEC ODT, or to any of its components. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity Reactions: If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue NURTEC ODT and initiate appropriate therapy. Severe hypersensitivity reactions have included dyspnea and rash, and can occur days after administration. ( 5.1 ) • Hypertension: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension may occur. ( 5.2 ) • Raynaud’s Phenomenon: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud’s phenomenon may occur. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including dyspnea and rash, have occurred with NURTEC ODT in clinical studies. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur days after administration, and delayed serious hypersensitivity has occurred. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue NURTEC ODT and initiate appropriate therapy [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.2 Hypertension Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of CGRP antagonists, including NURTEC ODT, in the postmarketing setting. Some of the patients who developed new-onset hypertension had risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment, but was most frequently reported within 7 days of therapy initiation. NURTEC ODT was discontinued in many of the reported cases. Monitor patients treated with NURTEC ODT for new-onset hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of NURTEC ODT is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology or blood pressure is inadequately controlled. 5.3 Raynaud’s Phenomenon Development of Raynaud’s phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud’s phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including NURTEC ODT. In reported cases with small molecule CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 1.5 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms. NURTEC ODT should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud’s phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: • Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Raynaud’s Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Acute treatment of migraine: the adverse reaction reported in ≥ 1% of patients treated with NURTEC ODT is nausea. ( 6.1 ) Preventive treatment of episodic migraine: adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% for rimegepant and ≥ 1% higher than placebo are nausea and abdominal pain/dyspepsia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Acute Treatment of Migraine The safety of NURTEC ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in adults has been evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study 1) in 682 patients with migraine who received one 75 mg dose of NURTEC ODT [see . Approximately 85% were female, 74% were White, 21% were Black, and 17% were Hispanic or Latino. The mean age at study entry was 40 years (range 18-75 years of age). Clinical Studies (14) ] Long-term safety was assessed in an open-label extension study using a different oral dosage form of rimegepant. That study evaluated 1,798 patients, dosing intermittently for up to one year, including 1,131 patients who were exposed to rimegepant 75 mg for at least 6 months, and 863 who were exposed for at least one year, all of whom treated an average of at least two migraine attacks per month. The most common adverse reaction in Study 1 was nausea (2% in patients who received NURTEC ODT compared to 0.4% of patients who received placebo). Hypersensitivity, including dyspnea and severe rash, occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with NURTEC ODT [see . Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Preventive Treatment of Episodic Migraine The safety of NURTEC ODT for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults has been established in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an open-label extension (Study 2) using a different oral dosage form of rimegepant [see . In the 12-week, double-blind treatment period, 370 patients with migraine received one 75 mg dose of rimegepant every other day Clinical Studies (14) ] . Approximately 81% were female, 80% were White, 17% were Black, and 28% were Hispanic or Latino. The mean age at study entry was 41 years (range 18-74 years of age). Long-term safety was assessed in an open-label extension study that included 603 patients who were treated for up to one year. Overall, 527 patients were exposed to rimegepant 75 mg for at least 6 months, and 311 were exposed for at least one year. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 2% of rimegepant-treated patients and at a frequency of at least 1% higher than placebo) in Study 2 were nausea (2.7% in patients who received rimegepant compared with 0.8% of patients who received placebo) and abdominal pain/dyspepsia (2.4% in patients who received rimegepant compared with 0.8% of patients who received placebo). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of NURTEC ODT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
