    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Xgeva is a RANK ligand (RANKL) inhibitor indicated for: Prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. ( 1.1 ) Treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity. ( 1.2 , 14.3 ) Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 \t\t      \tMultiple Myeloma and Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors Xgeva is indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma and in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. 1.2 \t\t      \tGiant Cell Tumor of Bone Xgeva is indicated for the treatment of adults and skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone that is unresectable or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity [see Clinical Trials ( 14.2 )] . 1.3 \t\t      \tHypercalcemia of Malignancy Xgeva is indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy refractory to bisphosphonate therapy.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypocalcemia ( 4.1 ) Known clinically significant hypersensitivity to Xgeva ( 4.2 ) 4.1 \t\t      \tHypocalcemia Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Xgeva [s ee Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . 4.2 \t\t      \tHypersensitivity Xgeva is contraindicated in patients with known clinically significant hypersensitivity to Xgeva [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] .",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Same Active Ingredient: Patients receiving Xgeva should not take Prolia ® . ( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis may occur.  Discontinue permanently if a clinically significant reaction occurs. ( 5.2 ) Hypocalcemia: Xgeva can cause severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, and fatal cases have been reported.  Correct hypocalcemia prior to initiating Xgeva.  Monitor calcium levels during therapy, especially in the first weeks of initiating therapy, and adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D. ( 5.3 ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients receiving Xgeva.  Perform an oral examination prior to starting Xgeva.  Monitor for symptoms.  Avoid invasive dental procedures during treatment with Xgeva. ( 5.4 ) Atypical femoral fracture: Evaluate patients with thigh or groin pain to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing Skeletons: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, and manage as clinically appropriate. ( 5.6 , 8.4 ) Multiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Treatment Discontinuation:  When Xgeva treatment is discontinued, evaluate the individual patient’s risk for vertebral fractures. ( 5.7 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm.  Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 \t\t      \tDrug Products with Same Active Ingredient Xgeva includes the same active ingredient (denosumab) found in Prolia. Patients receiving Xgeva should not take Prolia. 5.2 \t\t      \tHypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis has been reported with use of Xgeva. Reactions may include hypotension, dyspnea, upper airway edema, lip swelling, rash, pruritus, and urticaria. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue Xgeva therapy permanently [s ee Contraindi cation s ( 4.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . 5.3 \t\t      \tHypocalcemia Xgeva can cause severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, and fatal cases have been reported.  Correct pre-existing hypocalcemia prior to Xgeva treatment.  Monitor calcium levels, throughout Xgeva therapy, especially in the first weeks of initiating therapy, and administer calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D as necessary.  Concomitant use of calcimimetics and other drugs that can lower calcium levels may worsen hypocalcemia risk and serum calcium should be closely monitored.  Advise patients to contact a healthcare provider for symptoms of hypocalcemia [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. An increased risk of hypocalcemia has been observed in clinical trials of patients with increasing renal dysfunction, most commonly with severe dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min and/or on dialysis), and with inadequate/no calcium supplementation.  Monitor calcium levels and calcium and vitamin D intake [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.4 \t\t      \tOsteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients receiving Xgeva, manifesting as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration, or gingival erosion.  Persistent pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery may also be manifestations of ONJ.  In clinical trials in patients with cancer, the incidence of ONJ was higher with longer duration of exposure [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Seventy-nine percent of patients with ONJ had a history of tooth extraction, poor oral hygiene, or use of a dental appliance as a predisposing factor.  Other risk factors for the development of ONJ include immunosuppressive therapy, treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors, systemic corticosteroids, diabetes, and gingival infections.  Similarly, for Xgeva patients with multiple myeloma that developed ONJ, 58% had a history of invasive dental procedures as a predisposing factor. Perform an oral examination and appropriate preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of Xgeva and periodically during Xgeva therapy. Advise patients regarding oral hygiene practices. Avoid invasive dental procedures during treatment with Xgeva.  Consider temporary discontinuation of Xgeva therapy if an invasive dental procedure must be performed.  There are no data available to suggest the optimal duration of treatment interruption. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Xgeva should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon.  In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Clinical judgment of the treating healthcare provider should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual risk/benefit assessment. 5.5 \t\t      \tAtypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fracture Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with Xgeva [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] .  These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area.  They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.  A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture. During Xgeva treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain.  Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture.  Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb.  Interruption of Xgeva therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 \t\t      \tHypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing Skeletons Clinically significant hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization and complicated by acute renal injury has been reported in Xgeva-treated patients with giant cell tumor of bone and patients with growing skeletons.  Hypercalcemia has been reported within the first year after treatment discontinuation.  After treatment is discontinued, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, assess serum calcium periodically, reevaluate the patient’s calcium and vitamin D supplementation requirements and  manage patients as clinically appropriate [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.7 \t\t      \tMultiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Treatment Discontinuation Multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) have been reported following discontinuation of treatment with denosumab.  Patients at higher risk for MVF include those with risk factors for or a history of osteoporosis or prior fractures. When Xgeva treatment is discontinued, evaluate the individual patient’s risk for vertebral fractures [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.8 \t\t      \tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Xgeva can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of denosumab to cynomolgus monkeys throughout pregnancy at a dose 25-fold higher than the recommended human dose of Xgeva based on body weight resulted in increased fetal loss, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality, along with evidence of absent peripheral lymph nodes, abnormal bone growth and decreased neonatal growth. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Xgeva.  Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Xgeva during pregnancy or within 5 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm.  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 5 months after the last dose of Xgeva [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ] .",

Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors The safety of Xgeva was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trials [see Clinical Trials ( 14.1 )] in which a total of 2841 patients with bone metastasis from prostate cancer, breast cancer, or other solid tumors, or lytic bony lesions from multiple myeloma received at least one dose of Xgeva. In Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, patients were randomized to receive either 120 mg of Xgeva every 4 weeks as a subcutaneous injection or 4 mg (dose adjusted for reduced renal function) of zoledronic acid every 4 weeks by intravenous (IV) infusion.  Entry criteria included serum calcium (corrected) from 8 to 11.5 mg/dL (2 to 2.9 mmol/L) and creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or greater.  Patients who had received IV bisphosphonates were excluded, as were patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure.  During the study, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4 weeks.  Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. The median duration of exposure to Xgeva was 12 months (range: 0.1-41) and median duration on-study was 13 months (range: 0.1-41). Of patients who received Xgeva, 46% were female. Eighty-five percent were White, 5% Hispanic/Latino, 6% Asian, and 3% Black. The median age was 63 years (range: 18-93).  Seventy-five percent of patients who received Xgeva received concomitant chemotherapy. The most common adverse reactions in patients (incidence greater than or equal to 25%) were fatigue/asthenia, hypophosphatemia, and nausea (see Table 1).  The most common serious adverse reaction was dyspnea.  The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Xgeva were osteonecrosis and hypocalcemia.

Of patients who experienced severe hypocalcemia, 33% experienced 2 or more episodes of severe hypocalcemia and 16% experienced 3 or more episodes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. ▪ Severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 mg/dL or less than 0.6 mmol/L) occurred in 15.4% of patients treated with Xgeva and 7.4% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In the primary treatment phases of Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, ONJ was confirmed in 1.8% of patients in the Xgeva group (median exposure of 12.0 months; range: 0.1-40.5) and 1.3% of patients in the zoledronic acid group.  The trials in patients with breast (Study 20050136) or prostate (Study 20050103) cancer included an Xgeva open-label extension treatment phase where patients were offered Xgeva 120 mg once every 4 weeks (median overall exposure of 14.9 months; range: 0.1-67.2).  The patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.7% in the second year, and 4.6% per year thereafter.  The median time to ONJ was 20.6 months (range: 4-53) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with an extension treatment phase evaluating Xgeva for the prevention of bone metastases in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which Xgeva is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7 years, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.0% in the second year, and 7.1% per year thereafter. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fracture In the clinical trial program, atypical femoral fracture has been reported in patients treated with Xgeva and the risk increased with longer duration of treatment. Events have occurred during treatment and after treatment was discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Multiple Myeloma The safety of Xgeva was evaluated in an international, randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled trial of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with treatment through disease progression [see Clinical Trials ( 14.2 )] .  In this trial, patients received 120 mg Xgeva every 4 weeks as a subcutaneous injection (n = 850) or 4 mg (dose adjusted for renal function) of zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks by IV infusion (n = 852).  Entry criteria included serum calcium (corrected) from 8 to 11.5 mg/dL (2 to 2.9 mmol/L) and creatinine clearance 30 mL/min or greater.  Patients who had received IV bisphosphonates were excluded, as were patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure.  During the study, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4 weeks.  Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. The median duration of exposure to Xgeva was 16 months (range: 1-50) and median duration on-study was 17 months (range: 0-49).  Of patients who received Xgeva, 46% were female, 83% percent were White, 13% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 4% Hispanic/Latino.  The median age of the patients randomized to Xgeva was 63 years (range: 29-91) and all patients who received Xgeva received concomitant anti-myeloma chemotherapy. The adverse reaction profile of Xgeva in patients with multiple myeloma, Study 20090482, was similar to that observed in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103.  The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were diarrhea (34%), nausea (32%), anemia (22%), back pain (21%), thrombocytopenia (19%), peripheral edema (17%), hypocalcemia (16%), upper respiratory tract infection (15%), rash (14%), and headache (11%).  The most common serious adverse reaction (incidence ≥ 5%) was pneumonia (8%).  The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of Xgeva (≥ 1.0%) was osteonecrosis of the jaw. Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia Severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 7 mg/dL or less than 1.75 mmol/L) and severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 mg/dL or less than 0.6 mmol/L) occurred in 2% and 21% patients treated with Xgeva, respectively. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In the primary treatment phase of Study 20090482, ONJ was confirmed in 4.1% of patients in the Xgeva group (median exposure of 16 months; range: 1-50) and 2.8% of patients in the zoledronic acid group (median 15 months, range: 1-45 months).  At the completion of the double-blind treatment phase of Study 20090482, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ in the Xgeva group (median exposure of 19.4 months; range 1-52) was 2.0% during the first year of treatment, 5.0% in the second year, and 4.5% per year thereafter.  The median time to ONJ was 18.7 months (range: 1-44) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Giant Cell Tumor of Bone The safety of Xgeva was evaluated in two single-arm trials (Study 20062004 and Study 20040215) [see Clinical Trials ( 14.3 )] in which a total of 548 adult or skeletally mature adolescent patients with giant cell tumor of bone received at least 1 dose of Xgeva. Patients received 120 mg Xgeva subcutaneously every 4 weeks with additional 120 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy.  Patients receiving concurrent bisphosphonate therapy were excluded from enrollment in both studies.  Patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure were excluded from enrollment in Study 20040215.  During the trial, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4 weeks.  Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. Of the 548 patients who received Xgeva, 467 patients were treated with Xgeva for ≥ 1 year, 323 patients for ≥ 2 years, and 255 patients for ≥ 3 years.  The median number of doses received was 33 (range: 4-138 doses) and the median number of months on-study was 60 (range: 0-140 months). Fifty-seven percent of the enrolled patients were women and 82% were White.  The median age was 33 years (range: 13-83 years); a total of 19 patients were skeletally mature adolescents (12 to <17 years of age). The common adverse reaction profile of Xgeva in patients with giant cell tumor of bone was generally similar to that reported in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103.  The most common adverse reactions in patients (incidence ≥ 10%) were arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremity, fatigue, headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, musculoskeletal pain, toothache, vomiting, hypophosphatemia, constipation, diarrhea, and cough.  The most frequent serious adverse reactions were osteonecrosis of the jaw (3.6%), bone giant cell tumor (1.5%), anemia (1.1%), pneumonia (0.9%), and back pain (0.9%).  The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Xgeva was osteonecrosis of the jaw (incidence of 3.6%).  The adverse reaction profile appeared similar in skeletally mature adolescents and adults. Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia Moderate to severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 8 mg/dL or less than 2 mmol/L) occurred in 5% of patients treated with Xgeva. Severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 to 1 mg/dL or less than 0.6 to 0.3 mmol/L) occurred in 20% of patients treated with Xgeva. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In Study 20062004 and Study 20040215, ONJ was confirmed in 6.6% of patients who received Xgeva . [see Warnings and Prec autions ( 5.4 )] . Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fracture Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with Xgeva and was observed in 0.9% of patients in the pooled safety population [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation In the pooled safety population, 0.7% of patients experienced serious adverse events of hypercalcemia > 30 days following treatment discontinuation that was recurrent in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Xgeva was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial (Study 20070315) in which 33 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (with or without bone metastases) refractory to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy were enrolled [see Clinical Trials ( 14.4 )] . The adverse reaction profile of Xgeva in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy was similar to that reported in Studies 20050136, 20050244, 20050103, 20062004, and 20040215.  Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 20% of patients were nausea (30%), dyspnea (27%), decreased appetite (24%), headache (24%), peripheral edema (24%), vomiting (24%), anemia (21%), constipation (21%), and diarrhea (21%). The following adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater severity related to study therapy were reported on-study: fatigue (3%) and infection (6%). Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities included hypomagnesemia (3%), hypokalemia (3%), and hypophosphatemia (76%) of patients.  No deaths on-study were related to Xgeva therapy. 6.2 \t\t      \tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Xgeva.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypocalcemia: Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, including fatal cases [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypercalcemia:  Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia following treatment discontinuation can occur [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Musculoskeletal pain, including severe musculoskeletal pain.  Positive re-challenge has been reported. Lichenoid drug eruptions (e.g., lichen planus-like reactions). Alopecia. 6.3 \t\t      \tImmunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.  The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.  Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.  For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to denosumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies to other studies or to other products may be misleading. Using an electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay, less than 1% (7/2758) of patients with osseous metastases treated with denosumab doses ranging from 30-180 mg every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks for up to 3 years tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab.  None of the 37 patients with giant cell tumor of bone in Study 20040215 tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab. Three of the 506 patients with giant cell tumor of bone in Study 20062004 tested positive for transient binding antibodies following treatment with denosumab.  In multiple myeloma patients in Study 20090482, 1 out of 199 patients with a post-baseline result, tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab. No patient with positive binding antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies as assessed using a chemiluminescent cell-based in vitro biological assay.  There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, toxicity profile, or clinical response to denosumab associated with binding antibody development."
