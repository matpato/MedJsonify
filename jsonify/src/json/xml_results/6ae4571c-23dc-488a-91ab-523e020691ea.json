    "indications": "1     INDICATIONS AND USAGE BAXDELA is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial indicated for the treatment of adults with the following infections caused by designated susceptible bacteria: Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) ( 1.1 ) Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) ( 1.2 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BAXDELA and other antibacterial drugs, BAXDELA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.3 ) 1.1     Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections BAXDELA is indicated in adults for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant [MRSA] and methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Streptococcus agalactiae , Streptococcus anginosus Group (including Streptococcus anginosus , Streptococcus intermedius , and Streptococcus constellatus ), Streptococcus pyogenes , Enterococcus faecalis , Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 1.2     Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia BAXDELA is indicated in adults for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] isolates only), Klebsiella pneumoniae , Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae , Chlamydia pneumoniae , Legionella pneumophila, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 1.3     Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BAXDELA and other antibacterial drugs, BAXDELA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "4     CONTRAINDICATIONS BAXDELA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to delafloxacin or any of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial drugs, or any of the components of BAXDELA [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Known hypersensitivity to BAXDELA or other fluoroquinolones. ( 4 , 5.6 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5     WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: May occur after first or subsequent doses of BAXDELA. Discontinue BAXDELA at the first sign of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. ( 5.6 ) Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.7 ) 5.1     Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy and Central Nervous System Effects Fluoroquinolones have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions could occur within hours to weeks after starting a fluoroquinolone. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 and 5.4) ] Discontinue BAXDELA immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including BAXDELA, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones. 5.2     Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages. This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting a fluoroquinolone, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally. This risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over age 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and, in patients with kidney, heart, and lung transplant. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue BAXDELA immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Advise patients, at the first sign of tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation, to stop taking BAXDELA, to avoid exercise and use of the affected area, and to promptly contact their healthcare provider about changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid BAXDELA in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture . 5.3     Peripheral Neuropathy Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including BAXDELA. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of fluoroquinolones and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Discontinue BAXDELA immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation and/or motor strength in order to minimize the development of an irreversible condition. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including BAXDELA in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.4     Central Nervous System Effects Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Fluoroquinolones, including BAXDELA, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychosis; hallucinations, or paranoia; depression, or suicidal thoughts or acts; delirium, disorientation, confusion, or disturbances in attention; anxiety, agitation, or nervousness; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving BAXDELA, discontinue BAXDELA immediately and institute appropriate measures. Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions Fluoroquinolones have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. As with all fluoroquinolones, use BAXDELA when the benefits of treatment exceed the risks in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (e.g., severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold . If these reactions occur in patients receiving BAXDELA, discontinue BAXDELA immediately and institute appropriate measures. 5.5     Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis. Post-marketing serious adverse reactions, including death and requirement for ventilator support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis. Avoid BAXDELA in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [see . Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.6     Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients receiving BAXDELA . These reactions may occur after first or subsequent doses of BAXDELA [see Discontinue BAXDELA at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.7 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported in users of nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including BAXDELA, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.8     Risk of Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection Epidemiologic studies report an increased risk of aortic aneurysm and dissection within two months following use of fluoroquinolones, particularly in elderly patients. The cause for the increased risk has not been identified. In patients with a known aortic aneurysm or patients who are at greater risk for aortic aneurysms, reserve BAXDELA for use only when there are no alternative antibacterial treatments available. 5.9     Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing BAXDELA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.10     Blood Glucose Disturbances Fluoroquinolones have been associated with disturbances of blood glucose, including symptomatic hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, usually in diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (e.g., glyburide) or with insulin. In these patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death have been reported with other fluoroquinolones. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs in a patient being treated with BAXDELA, discontinue BAXDELA and initiate appropriate therapy immediately [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6     ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious and otherwise important adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling: Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Peripheral Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Central Nervous System Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Blood Glucose Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2%) are nausea, diarrhea, headache, transaminase elevations, and vomiting.

Overview of the Safety Evaluation of BAXDELA BAXDELA was evaluated in three Phase 3 multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind clinical trials. These trials included two trials in ABSSSI patients (Trial 1 and Trial 2) and one trial in CABP (Trial 3). A total of 1170 patients were treated with BAXDELA across all Phase 3 trials (741 patients in the two ABSSSI trials and 429 patients in the CABP trial). Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) BAXDELA was evaluated in two multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, non-inferiority trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) in adults with ABSSSI. In Trial 1 patients received BAXDELA 300 mg by intravenous infusion every 12 hours and in Trial 2 the patients received BAXDELA 300 mg by intravenous infusion every 12 hours for 6 doses then were switched to BAXDELA 450 mg tablets every 12 hours. The total treatment duration was 5 to 14 days. Adverse reactions were evaluated for 741 patients treated with BAXDELA and 751 patients treated with comparator antibacterial drugs. The median age of patients treated with BAXDELA was 49 years, ranging between 18 and 94 years old; 15% were age 65 years and older. Patients treated with BAXDELA were predominantly male (62%) and Caucasian (86%). The BAXDELA treated population included 44% obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ), 11% with diabetes, and 16% with baseline renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance less than 90 mL/min). Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation Serious adverse reactions occurred in 3/741 (0.4%) of patients treated with BAXDELA and in 6/751 (0.8%) of patients treated with the comparator. BAXDELA was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 7/741 (0.9%) patients and the comparator was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 21/751 (2.8%) patients. The most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation in the BAXDELA arm included urticaria (2/741; 0.3%) and hypersensitivity (2/741; 0.3%); whereas, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to study discontinuation in the comparator arm included urticaria (5/751; 0.7%), rash (4/751; 0.5%), hypersensitivity and infusion site extravasation (2/751; 0.3%). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with BAXDELA were nausea (8%), diarrhea (8%), headache (3%), transaminase elevations (3%), and vomiting (2%). Table 4 lists selected adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of patients receiving BAXDELA in the pooled adult Phase 3 clinical trials. Table 4     Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 2% of Patients Receiving BAXDELA in the Pooled Adult Phase 3 ABSSSI Clinical Trials Adverse Reactions BAXDELA N = 741 (%) Vancomycin/aztreonam N = 751 (%) Nausea 8% 6% Diarrhea 8% 3% Headache The data are not an adequate basis for comparison of rates between the study drug and the active control. 3% 6% Transaminase Elevations Pooled reports include hypertransaminasaemia, increased transaminases, and increased ALT and AST. 3% 4% Vomiting 2% 2% Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia BAXDELA was evaluated in one multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind trial in adults with CABP (Trial 3). Patients received BAXDELA 300 mg over 60 minutes every 12 hours for a minimum of 6 doses with an option to switch to oral BAXDELA tablet 450 mg every 12 hours for the remaining doses (total of 10 to 20 doses of intravenous infusion and oral combined). Adverse reactions were evaluated for 429 patients treated with BAXDELA and 427 patients treated with moxifloxacin. The median age of patients treated with BAXDELA was 63 years, ranging between 18 and 89 years; 47.1% were 65 years of age and older and 19.6% were 75 years of age and older. Patients treated with BAXDELA were predominantly male (58.3%) and white (92.3%). The BAXDELA-treated population included patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30) (24.0%), COPD/asthma (14.2%), cardiac disease (24.2%), diabetes (16.3%), and baseline renal impairment including 36.4% with moderate renal impairment (CrCl less than 30-59 mL/min), and 4.0% with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 29 mL/min). Overall, approximately 12.4% of patients were in PORT Risk Class II, 60.1% were in PORT Risk Class III, 26.6% were in PORT Risk Class IV, and 0.9% were in PORT Risk Class V. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation Serious adverse reactions occurred in 2/429 (0.5%) of patients treated with BAXDELA and in 1/427 (0.2%) of patients treated with moxifloxacin. Discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9/429 (2.1%) patients treated with BAXDELA and in 4/427 (0.9%) treated with moxifloxacin. The most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to study drug discontinuation in the BAXDELA arm were transaminase elevations (2/429; 0.5%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to study drug discontinuation in the comparator arm were infusion site reactions (1/427; 0.2%). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with BAXDELA were diarrhea (5%) and transaminase elevations (5%). Table 5 lists selected adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of patients receiving BAXDELA in the adult Phase 3 CABP clinical trial.
