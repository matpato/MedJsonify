    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Reduced serum vitamin A levels and recommended supplementation: Supplement with the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Refer to an ophthalmologist if ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency occur. ( 5.1 ) 5.1  Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation AMVUTTRA treatment leads to a decrease in serum vitamin A levels [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A is advised for patients taking AMVUTTRA. Higher doses than the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with AMVUTTRA, as serum vitamin A levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body. Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g., night blindness).",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Reduced Serum Vitamin A Levels and Recommended Supplementation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) were pain in extremity, arthralgia, dyspnea, and vitamin A decreased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alnylam Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-256-9526 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1  Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of AMVUTTRA cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Two Phase 3 randomized, multi-center studies evaluated the safety of AMVUTTRA in 448 transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR) patients, including 122 patients with hATTR-PN (HELIOS-A) and 326 patients with ATTR-CM (HELIOS-B) [see . In both studies, patients were instructed to take the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A Clinical Studies (14) ] [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Polyneuropathy of Hereditary Transthyretin-mediated Amyloidosis In HELIOS-A, 118 patients received at least 18 months of treatment. The mean duration of treatment was 18.8 months (range: 1.7 to 19.4 months). The median patient age at baseline was 60 years and 65% of the patients were male. Seventy percent of AMVUTTRA-treated patients were Caucasian, 17% were Asian, 3% were Black, and 9% were reported as Other. Forty-four percent of patients had the Val30Met mutation in the transthyretin gene; the remaining patients had one of 21 other mutations. At baseline, 70% of patients were in Stage 1 of the disease and 30% were in Stage 2. The most common adverse reactions (at least 5%) were pain in extremity, arthralgia, dyspnea, and vitamin A decreased (see . Table 1 ) Seventy-four percent of patients treated with AMVUTTRA had normal vitamin A levels at baseline, and 98% of those with a normal baseline developed low vitamin A levels. In some cases, the decreased vitamin A level was reported as an adverse reaction (see . Table 1 ) Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 5% of Patients Treated with AMVUTTRA in HELIOS-A Adverse Reaction AMVUTTRA N=122 % Pain in extremity 15 Arthralgia Comprised of several similar terms 11 Dyspnea 7 Vitamin A decreased Percentage only reflects those reported as an adverse reaction 7 In HELIOS-A, two serious adverse reactions of atrioventricular (AV) heart block (1.6%) occurred in patients treated with AMVUTTRA, including one case of complete AV block. Injection site reactions were reported in 5 (4%) patients treated with AMVUTTRA. Reported symptoms included bruising, erythema, pain, pruritus, and warmth. Injection site reactions were mild and transient. Cardiomyopathy of Wild-type or Hereditary Transthyretin-mediated Amyloidosis In HELIOS-B, safety was evaluated in 654 patients with ATTR-CM, which included 257 patients treated with AMVUTTRA for ≥30 months, and 77 patients treated with AMVUTTRA for ≥36 months [see . No new safety issues were identified. Eighty-two percent of patients treated with AMVUTTRA had normal vitamin A levels at baseline, and 80% of those with a normal baseline developed low vitamin A levels. Clinical Studies (14) ]"
