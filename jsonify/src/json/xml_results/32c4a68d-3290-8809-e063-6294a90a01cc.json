    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE QLOSI is indicated for the treatment of presbyopia in adults. QLOSI is a cholinergic agonist indicated for the treatment of presbyopia in adults. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS QLOSI is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or to any of the excipients. Hypersensitivity ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Blurred Vision : Advise patients to not drive or operate machinery if vision is not clear (e.g., blurred vision). Exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous occupations in poor illumination. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Retinal Detachment : Rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported with miotics. Examination of the retina is advised in all patients prior to initiation of therapy. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care with sudden onset of flashes of lights, floaters, or vision loss. ( 5.2 ) Iritis : Caution is advised in patients with iritis. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Blurred Vision Miotics, including QLOSI, may cause accommodative spasm. Advise patients to not drive or operate machinery if vision is not clear (e.g., blurred vision). In addition, patients may experience temporary dim or dark vision with miotics, including QLOSI. Advise patients to exercise caution in night driving and other hazardous activities in poor illumination. 5.2 Risk of Retinal Detachment Rare cases of retinal detachment have been reported with miotics when used in susceptible individuals and those with pre-existing retinal disease. Examination of the retina is advised in all patients prior to the initiation of therapy. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care with sudden onset of flashes of lights, floaters, or vision loss. 5.3 Iritis QLOSI is not recommended to be used when iritis is present because adhesions (synechiae) may form between the iris and the lens. 5.4 Contact Lens Wear Contact lens wearers should be advised to remove their lenses prior to the instillation of QLOSI and to wait 10 minutes after dosing before reinserting their contact lenses. 5.5 Potential for Eye Injury or Contamination To prevent eye injury or contamination, avoid touching the tip of the single-patient-use vial to the eye or to any other surface.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (5% to 8%) are instillation site pain and headaches. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Orasis Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-866-ORASIS1 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. QLOSI was evaluated in 309 patients with presbyopia in two randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled studies (NEAR-1 and NEAR-2) of 15 days duration. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events in 5-8% of patients were instillation site pain, and headache. Ocular adverse reaction reported in 2-5% of patients was blurred vision. The majority of the adverse events were mild, transient and self-resolving."
