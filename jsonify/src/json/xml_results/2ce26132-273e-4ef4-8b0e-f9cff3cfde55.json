    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions : Immune-mediated adverse reactions (IMAR) can occur in any organ system or tissue, the following: immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated pneumonitis, and immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, and can occur at any time during treatment or after discontinuation. Monitor for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of IMAR. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone level and thyroid function including at baseline and before each dose. In general, withhold YERVOY for severe (grade 3) and permanently discontinue for life-threatening (grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reactions. See Full Prescribing Information for additional dosage modifications. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) • Infusion-Related Reactions : Discontinue for severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) • Complications of allogeneic HSCT : Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with YERVOY. (5.3) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions YERVOY is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks T-cell inhibitory signals induced by the CTLA-4 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response with the potential for induction of immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not be inclusive of all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting YERVOY. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and before each dose. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue YERVOY depending on severity [see In general, if YERVOY requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Immune-Mediated Colitis YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a Single Agent Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 12% (62/511) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent, including Grade 3-5 (7%) and Grade 2 (5%). Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY in 4.3% and withholding of at least one dose of YERVOY in 0.2% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 74% (46/62) of patients with immune-mediated colitis. Five patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Colitis resolved in 76% of the 62 patients. One patient was withheld one or more doses of YERVOY for colitis, and no patient received additional treatment after symptom improvement. YERVOY 1 mg/kg with 3 mg/kg Nivolumab Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 9% (60/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC, including Grade 3 (4.4%), and Grade 2 (3.7%). Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.2% and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 2.7% of patients. In patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic corticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated colitis. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in 100% (60/60) of patients with immune-mediated colitis. Approximately 23% of patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Colitis resolved in 95% of the 60 patients. Of the 18 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for colitis, 16 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 10 had recurrence of colitis. YERVOY 3 mg/kg with 1 mg/kg Nivolumab Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 25% (115/456) of patients with melanoma or HCC receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 4 (0.4%), Grade 3 (14%), and Grade 2 (8%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY with nivolumab in 14% and withholding of treatment in 4.4% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (115/115) of patients with colitis. Approximately 23% of patients required addition of infliximab to high-dose corticosteroids. Colitis resolved in 93% of 115 patients. Of the 20 patients in whom YERVOY with nivolumab was withheld for colitis, 16 reinitiated treatment after symptom improvement, and 9 had recurrence of colitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a Single Agent Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 4.1% (21/511) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent, including Grade 3-5 (1.6%) and Grade 2 (2.5%).

Systemic corticosteroids were required in 29% (6/21) of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis. No patients required the coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 86% of the 21 patients. YERVOY 3 mg/kg with Vemurafenib The safety and effectiveness of YERVOY in combination with vemurafenib have not been established [see . In a dose-finding trial, Grade 3 increases in transaminases with or without concomitant increases in total bilirubin occurred in 6 of 10 patients who received concurrent YERVOY (3 mg/kg) and vemurafenib (960 mg or 720 mg twice daily). Indications and Usage (1) ] YERVOY 1 mg/kg with 3 mg/kg Nivolumab Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 7% (48/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC, including Grade 4 (1.2%), Grade 3 (4.9%), and Grade 2 (0.4%). Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.6% and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 2.6% of patients. In patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic corticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated hepatitis. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in 100% (48/48) of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis. Approximately 19% of patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 88% of the 48 patients.  Of the 17 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for hepatitis, 14 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 10 had recurrence of hepatitis. YERVOY 3 mg/kg with 1 mg/kg Nivolumab Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 15% (70/456) of patients with melanoma or HCC receiving YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including Grade 4 (2.4%), Grade 3 (11%), and Grade 2 (1.8%) adverse reactions. Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY with nivolumab in 8% and withholding of treatment in 3.5% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (70/70) of patients with hepatitis. Approximately 9% of patients with immune-mediated hepatitis required addition of mycophenolic acid to high-dose corticosteroids. Hepatitis resolved in 91% of the 70 patients. Of the 16 patients in whom YERVOY with nivolumab was withheld for hepatitis, 14 reinitiated treatment after symptom improvement, and 8 had recurrence of hepatitis. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions YERVOY can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis, including bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms). Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-bullous/exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue YERVOY depending on severity [see .

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Across clinical trials of YERVOY administered as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified, as shown below: Nervous System: Autoimmune neuropathy (2%), meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, motor dysfunction Cardiovascular: Angiopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, temporal arteritis, vasculitis Ocular: Blepharitis, episcleritis, iritis, orbital myositis, scleritis, uveitis. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving YERVOY and may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Duodenitis, gastritis, pancreatitis (1.3%) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Arthritis, myositis, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis Other (hematologic/immune): Aplastic anemia, conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), hypersensitivity vasculitis, meningitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and solid organ transplant rejection. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Severe infusion-related reactions can occur with YERVOY. Discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion reactions [see . Infusion-related reactions occurred in 0.6% (3/511) of patients who received single-agent YERVOY 3 mg/kg for the unresectable or metastatic treatment of melanoma. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 5% (33/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or CRC. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of HCC. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant after YERVOY Fatal or serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can occur in patients who receive YERVOY either before or after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between CTLA-4 receptor blocking antibody and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of GVHD and intervene promptly [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with YERVOY after allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight) and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner. The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , . 8.3 )] 5.5 Risks Associated When Administered in Combination with Nivolumab YERVOY is indicated for use in combination with nivolumab for patients with advanced RCC, MSI-H or dMMR mCRC, HCC, and NSCLC. Refer to the nivolumab Full Prescribing Information for additional risk information that applies to the combination use treatment.",

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-800-721-5072 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent (or in combination with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine) in 511 patients in Study MDX010-20; YERVOY 1 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 3 mg/kg in 1,362 patients in CHECKMATE-214, CHECKMATE-142, CHECKMATE-227, and CHECKMATE-743; YERVOY 3 mg/kg administered with nivolumab 1 mg/kg in 456 patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-067, CHECKMATE-040, and another randomized trial; and to YERVOY 1 mg/kg, administered in combination with nivolumab and platinum-doublet chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA. Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety of YERVOY was evaluated in 643 previously treated patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma in Study MDX010-20 [see . Study MDX010-20 excluded patients with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. Patients received YERVOY 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion for 4 doses as a single agent (n=131), YERVOY with an investigational gp100 peptide vaccine (n=380), or gp100 peptide vaccine as a single agent (n=132). Patients in the trial received a median of 4 doses (range: 1 to 4 doses). Clinical Studies (14.1) ] The trial population characteristics were: median age 57 years (range: 19 to 90), 59% male, 94% White, and baseline ECOG performance status 0 (56%). YERVOY was discontinued for adverse reactions in 10% of patients. Table 4 presents adverse reactions from Study MDX010-20.

Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Patients were randomized to receive: • YERVOY 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 90 minutes with nivolumab 1 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab as a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (YERVOY and nivolumab arm; n=313), or • Nivolumab 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (nivolumab arm; n=313), or • YERVOY 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses (YERVOY arm; n=311). The median duration of exposure to nivolumab was 2.8 months (range: 1 day to 36.4 months) for the YERVOY and nivolumab arm. In the YERVOY and nivolumab arm, 39% were exposed to nivolumab for ≥6 months and 30% exposed for >1 year. Serious adverse reactions (74%), adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation (47%) or to dosing delays (58%), and Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (72%) occurred in patients treated with YERVOY and nivolumab. The most frequent (≥10%) serious adverse reactions in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm were diarrhea (13%), colitis (10%), and pyrexia (10%). The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of both drugs in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm were colitis (10%), diarrhea (8%), increased ALT (4.8%), increased AST (4.5%), and pneumonitis (1.9%). The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in the YERVOY and nivolumab arm were fatigue, diarrhea, rash, nausea, pyrexia, pruritus, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, decreased appetite, cough, headache, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, and increased transaminases.
