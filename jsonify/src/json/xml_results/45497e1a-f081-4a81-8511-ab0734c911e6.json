    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-Related Reactions (IRR)/Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic Reactions : Administer BIZENGRI in a setting with emergency resuscitation equipment and staff who are trained to monitor for IRRs and to administer emergency medications. Monitor for signs and symptoms of IRR. Interrupt infusion in patients with ≤ Grade 3 IRRs and administer symptomatic treatment as needed. Resume infusion at a reduced rate after resolution of symptoms. Immediately stop the infusion and permanently discontinue BIZENGRI for Grade 4 or life-threatening IRR or hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis. ( 5.1 ) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis : Monitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue BIZENGRI in patients with ≥ Grade 2 ILD/pneumonitis. ( 5.2 ) Left Ventricular Dysfunction : Assess LVEF before initiating BIZENGRI and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage through treatment interruption or discontinuation. Permanently discontinue BIZENGRI in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Infusion-Related Reactions/Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic Reactions BIZENGRI can cause serious and life-threatening infusion-related reactions (IRRs), hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Signs and symptoms of IRR may include chills, nausea, fever, and cough. In the eNRGy study, 13% of patients experienced IRRs, all were Grade 1 or 2; 91% occurred during the first infusion.  The median time to onset was 63 minutes (range: 13 minutes to 240 minutes) from the start of infusion. Administer BIZENGRI in a setting with emergency resuscitation equipment and staff who are trained to monitor for IRRs and to administer emergency medications. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during infusion and for at least 1 hour following completion of first BIZENGRI infusion and as clinically indicated. Prior to the first BIZENGRI infusion, premedicate with a corticosteroid, an H1 antihistamine and acetaminophen to reduce the risk of IRRs [see Dosage and Administration ( Corticosteroid premedication can be used as necessary for subsequent BIZENGRI infusions. 2.4 )]. Interrupt BIZENGRI infusion in patients with ≤ Grade 3 IRRs and administer symptomatic treatment as needed. Resume infusion at a reduced rate after resolution of symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( Immediately stop the infusion and permanently discontinue BIZENGRI for Grade 4 or life-threatening IRR or hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions. 2.5 )]. 5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis BIZENGRI can cause serious and life-threatening interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. In the eNRGy study [see Adverse Reactions ( ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 2 (1.1%) patients treated with BIZENGRI. Grade 2 ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2) resulting in permanent discontinuation of BIZENGRI occurred in 1 (0.6%) patient. 6.1 )], Monitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold BIZENGRI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and administer corticosteroids as clinically indicated. Permanently discontinue BIZENGRI if ILD/pneumonitis ≥ Grade 2 is confirmed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 5.3 Left Ventricular Dysfunction BIZENGRI can cause left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease occurred with anti-HER2 therapies, including BIZENGRI. Treatment with BIZENGRI has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF less than 50% prior to initiation of treatment. In the eNRGy study [see Adverse Reactions ( Grade 2 LVEF decrease [Grade 2 LVEF decrease (40%-50%; 10 - 19% drop from baseline)] occurred in 2% of evaluable patients. Cardiac failure without LVEF decrease occurred in 1.7% of patients including 1 (0.6%) fatal event. 6.1 )], Before initiating BIZENGRI, evaluate LVEF and monitor at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. For LVEF of less than 45% or less than 50% with absolute decrease from baseline of 10% or greater is confirmed, permanently discontinue BIZENGRI. Permanently discontinue BIZENGRI in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, BIZENGRI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In literature reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of HER2 and/or HER3 results in impaired embryo-fetal development, including effects on cardiac, vascular and neuronal development, and embryolethality. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of BIZENGRI. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BIZENGRI and for 2 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.3 )]",

The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to BIZENGRI as a single agent at 750 mg administered intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in 175 patients with NRG1 gene fusion positive tumors in the eNRGy study. Of these, there were 99 patients with NSCLC, 39 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 37 patients with other solid tumors [see Clinical Studies ( . Among the 175 patients who received BIZENGRI, the median duration of exposure to BIZENGRI was 5.3 months (range: 0.1 to 36), including 45% of patients exposed for at least 6 months and 15% of patients exposed for at least 1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥ 10%) adverse reactions were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, nausea, infusion-related reactions (IRR), dyspnea, rash, constipation, vomiting, abdominal pain, and edema. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (≥ 2%) were increased GGT, decreased hemoglobin, decreased sodium, decreased platelets, increased AST, increased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, decreased magnesium, decreased phosphate, increased aPTT and increased bilirubin. 14.1 , 14.2 )] NRG1 Gene Fusion Positive Unresectable or Metastatic NSCLC eNRGy Study The safety of BIZENGRI was evaluated in the eNRGy study in 99 patients with unresectable or metastatic NSCLC with NRG1 gene fusions [see Clinical Studies ( Patients received BIZENGRI as a single agent at 750 mg intravenously every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
