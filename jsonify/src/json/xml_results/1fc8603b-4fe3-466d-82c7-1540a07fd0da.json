    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) : MDS/AML occurred in patients exposed to TALZENNA, and some cases were fatal. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity and discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. ( 5.1 ) • Myelosuppression : TALZENNA may affect hematopoiesis and can cause anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. ( 5.2 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : TALZENNA can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\tMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) , including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported in patients who received TALZENNA. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in 0.4 % (3 out of 788 ) of solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA as a single agent in clinical studies. In TALAPRO-2, MDS/AML occurred in 2 out of 511 (0.4%) patients treated with TALZENNA and enzalutamide and in 0 out of 517 (0%) patients treated with placebo and enzalutamide The durations of TALZENNA treatment in these five patients prior to developing MDS/AML [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] were 0.3, 1, 2, 3, and 5 years , respectively. Most of these patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy. Do not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy. Monitor blood counts monthly during treatment with TALZENNA . For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt TALZENNA and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If counts do not recover within 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue TALZENNA. 5.2\tMyelosuppression Myelosuppression consisting of anemia, neutropenia , and/or thrombocytopenia, have been reported in patients treated with TALZENNA [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 21%, and 15% of patients receiving TALZENNA as a single agent . Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 0.7%, 0.3%, and 0.3% of patients. In TALAPRO-2, Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 45%, 18%, and 8% of patients receiving TALZENNA and enzalutamide. Overall, 39% of patients (199/511) required a red blood cell transfusion, including 22% (111/511) who required multiple transfusions. Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 7%, 3%, and 0.4% of patients. Withhold TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous therapy. Monitor blood counts monthly during treatment with TALZENNA. If hematological toxicities do not resolve within 28 days, discontinue TALZENNA and refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics . [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] 5.3\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal data, TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproduction study, administration of talazoparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused fetal malformations and structural skeletal variations, and embryo-fetal death at exposures that were 0.24 times the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 1 mg daily. Apprise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of TALZENNA [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months following the last dose of TALZENNA [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]",
