    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PONVORY is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. PONVORY is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS PONVORY is contraindicated in patients who: In the last 6 months, have experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III or IV heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Have presence of Mobitz type II second-degree, third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial block, unless patient has a functioning pacemaker [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] In the last 6 months, experienced myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization, or Class III/IV heart failure ( 4 ) Presence of Mobitz type II second-degree, third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial block, unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections : PONVORY may increase the risk of infections. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) before initiating treatment. Monitor for infection during treatment and for 1–2 weeks after discontinuation. Do not start PONVORY in patients with active infection. ( 5.1 ) Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays : PONVORY may result in a transient decrease in heart rate; titration is required for treatment initiation. Check an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for preexisting cardiac conduction abnormalities before starting PONVORY. Consider cardiology consultation for conduction abnormalities or concomitant use with other drugs that decrease heart rate. ( 5.2 , 7.2 , 7.3 ) Respiratory Effects : May cause a decline in pulmonary function. Assess pulmonary function (e.g., spirometry) if clinically indicated. ( 5.3 ) Liver Injury : Discontinue if significant liver injury is confirmed. Obtain liver function tests before initiating PONVORY. ( 5.4 ) Increased Blood Pressure (BP) : Monitor BP during treatment. ( 5.5 ) Cutaneous Malignancies: Periodic skin examination is recommended. ( 5.6 ) Fetal Risk : Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 1 week after stopping PONVORY. ( 5.7 ) Macular Edema : An ophthalmic evaluation is recommended before starting treatment and if there is any change in vision while taking PONVORY. Diabetes mellitus and uveitis increase the risk. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Infections Risk of Infections PONVORY causes a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 30–40% of baseline values because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues [see . PONVORY may therefore increase the susceptibility to infections. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have been reported in association with other sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] In Study 1 [see , the overall rate of infections was comparable between the PONVORY-treated patients and those receiving teriflunomide 14 mg (54.2% vs 52.1%, respectively). PONVORY increased the risk of upper respiratory tract infections. Serious or severe infections occurred in 1.6% of PONVORY-treated patients compared to 0.9% of patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. Clinical Studies (14) ] Before initiating treatment with PONVORY, results from a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior therapy) complete blood count including lymphocyte count should be reviewed. Initiation of treatment with PONVORY should be delayed in patients with active infection until resolution. Lymphocyte counts returned to the normal range in 90% of patients within 1 week of stopping therapy in modeling studies [see . In Study 1, peripheral lymphocyte counts returned to normal range within 2 weeks after discontinuation of PONVORY, which was the first timepoint evaluated. Because residual pharmacodynamic effects, such as lowering effects on peripheral lymphocyte count, may persist for 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuation of PONVORY, vigilance for infection should be continued for 1 to 2 weeks after PONVORY is discontinued Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ]. In Study 1, the proportion of patients who experienced lymphocyte counts less than 0.2×10 9 /L was 3.2%. Effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be employed in patients with symptoms of infection while on therapy. Consider interruption of treatment with PONVORY if a patient develops a serious infection. Herpes Viral Infections Cases of herpes viral infection have been reported in the development program of PONVORY; herpes simplex encephalitis and varicella zoster meningitis have been reported with other S1P receptor modulators. In Study 1, the rate of herpetic infections was 4.8% for both PONVORY-treated patients and those receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of varicella (chickenpox) or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating PONVORY (see . Vaccinations ) Cryptococcal Infections Cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis (CM) and disseminated cryptococcal infections have been reported with other S1P receptor modulators. Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or signs of CM. Patients with symptoms or signs consistent with a cryptococcal infection should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and treatment. PONVORY treatment should be suspended until a cryptococcal infection has been excluded. If CM is diagnosed, appropriate treatment should be initiated. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators and other multiple sclerosis (MS) therapies and has been associated with some risk factors (e.g., immunocompromised patients, polytherapy with immunosuppressants). Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that may be suggestive of PML. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, treatment with PONVORY should be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is confirmed, treatment with PONVORY should be discontinued. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators who developed PML and subsequently discontinued treatment. IRIS presents as a clinical decline in the patient's condition that may be rapid, can lead to serious neurological complications or death, and is often associated with characteristic changes on MRI. The time to onset of IRIS in patients with PML was generally within a few months after S1P receptor modulator discontinuation. Monitoring for development of IRIS and appropriate treatment of the associated inflammation should be undertaken. Prior and Concomitant Treatment with Anti-neoplastic, Immune-Modulating, or Immunosuppressive Therapies Anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating, or immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids) should be coadministered with caution because of the risk of additive immune system effects [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Vaccinations Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating PONVORY treatment. A full course of vaccination for antibody-negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with PONVORY, following which initiation of treatment with PONVORY should be postponed for 4 weeks to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur. No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations in patients taking PONVORY. Vaccinations may be less effective if administered during PONVORY treatment. If live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, administer at least 1 month prior to initiation of PONVORY. Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during and for 1 to 2 weeks after treatment with PONVORY. 5.2 Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays Since initiation of PONVORY treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular (AV) conduction delays, an up-titration scheme must be used to reach the maintenance dosage of PONVORY (20 mg) [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] Study 1 did not include patients who had: A resting heart rate (HR) less than 50 beats per minute (bpm) on baseline electrocardiogram Myocardial infarction or unstable ischemic heart disease in the last 6 months Cardiac failure (New York Heart Association class III–IV) or presence of any severe cardiac disease Cardiac conduction or rhythm disorders (including sino-atrial heart block, symptomatic bradycardia, atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac arrest) either in history or observed at screening Mobitz Type II second degree AV block or higher-grade AV block observed at screening QTcF interval greater than 470 ms (females) and greater than 450 ms (males) observed at screening History of syncope associated with cardiac disorders Uncontrolled systemic arterial hypertension Reduction in Heart Rate Initiation of PONVORY may result in a transient decrease in HR. In Study 1, bradycardia at treatment initiation and sinus bradycardia on ECG (defined as HR less than 50 bpm) occurred in 5.8% of PONVORY-treated patients compared to 1.6% of patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. After the first titration dose of PONVORY, the decrease in heart rate typically begins within an hour and reaches its nadir within 2–4 hours. The heart rate typically recovers to baseline levels 4–5 hours after administration. The mean decrease in heart rate on Day 1 of dosing was 6 bpm. With up-titration after Day 1, the post-dose decrease in heart rate is less pronounced. Bradycardia resolved in all patients in Study 1 without intervention and did not require discontinuation of PONVORY treatment. On Day 1, 3 patients treated with PONVORY had asymptomatic post-dose HR below or equal to 40 bpm; all 3 patients had baseline HRs below 55 bpm. Atrioventricular Conduction Delays Initiation of PONVORY treatment has been associated with transient atrioventricular conduction delays that follow a similar temporal pattern as the observed decrease in heart rate during dose titration. In Study 1, the AV conduction delays manifested as first-degree AV block (prolonged PR interval on ECG), which occurred in 3.4% of PONVORY-treated patients and in 1.2% of patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. The conduction abnormalities typically were transient, asymptomatic, resolved within 24 hours, resolved without intervention, and did not require discontinuation of PONVORY treatment. In Study 1, second- and third-degree AV blocks were not reported in patients treated with PONVORY. If treatment with PONVORY is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought for individuals: With significant QT prolongation (QTc greater than 500 msec) With atrial flutter/fibrillation or arrhythmia treated with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] With unstable ischemic heart disease, cardiac decompensated failure occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation, history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease (TIA, stroke occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation), or uncontrolled hypertension With a history of Mobitz Type II second degree AV block or higher-grade AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block [see Contraindications (4) ] Treatment Initiation Recommendations Obtain an ECG in all patients to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In all patients, a dose titration is recommended for initiation of PONVORY treatment to help reduce cardiac effects [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] In patients with sinus bradycardia, first-or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure with onset more than 6 months prior to initiation, first-dose monitoring is recommended [see . Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3) ] PONVORY is not recommended in patients with a history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease (e.g., TIA, stroke occurring more than 6 months prior to treatment initiation), uncontrolled hypertension, or severe untreated sleep apnea, since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in these patients. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy. Use of PONVORY in patients with a history of recurrent syncope or symptomatic bradycardia should be based on an overall benefit-risk assessment. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring. Experience with PONVORY is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that decrease heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers - diltiazem and verapamil, and other drugs that may decrease heart rate such as digoxin). Concomitant use of these drugs during PONVORY initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring. For patients receiving a stable dose of a beta-blocker, the resting heart rate should be considered before introducing PONVORY treatment. If the resting heart rate is greater than 55 bpm under chronic beta-blocker treatment, PONVORY can be introduced. If resting heart rate is less than or equal to 55 bpm, beta-blocker treatment should be interrupted until the baseline heart rate is greater than 55 bpm. Treatment with PONVORY can then be initiated and treatment with a beta-blocker can be reinitiated after PONVORY has been up-titrated to the target maintenance dosage [see . Drug Interactions (7.3) ] For patients taking other drugs that decrease heart rate, treatment with PONVORY should generally not be initiated without consultation from a cardiologist because of the potential additive effect on heart rate [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] Missed Dose During Treatment Initiation or Maintenance Treatment If 4 or more consecutive daily doses are missed during treatment initiation or maintenance treatment, reinitiate Day 1 of the dose titration (new starter pack) and follow first-dose monitoring recommendations [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] 5.3 Respiratory Effects Dose-dependent reductions in forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV 1 ) and reductions in diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DL CO ) were observed in PONVORY-treated patients mostly occurring in the first month after treatment initiation. In Study 1, the reduction from baseline in percent predicted FEV 1 at 2 years was 8.3% in PONVORY-treated patients compared to 4.4% in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. In Study 1, 7 patients discontinued PONVORY because of pulmonary adverse events. There is insufficient information to determine the reversibility of the decrease in FEV 1 or FVC after treatment discontinuation. PONVORY should be used with caution in patients with severe respiratory disease (i.e., pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function should be performed during therapy with PONVORY if clinically indicated. 5.4 Liver Injury Elevations of transaminases may occur in PONVORY-treated patients. Obtain transaminase and bilirubin levels, if not recently available (i.e., within last 6 months) before initiation of PONVORY. In Study 1, elevations of ALT to 5-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater occurred in 4.6% of patients treated with PONVORY compared to 2.5% of patients who received teriflunomide 14 mg. Elevation of ALT to 3-fold the ULN or greater occurred in 17.3% of patients treated with PONVORY and 8.3% of patients treated with teriflunomide 14 mg. The median time to an elevation of 3-fold the ULN was 3 months. The majority (89%) of patients with ALT increases 3-fold or greater the ULN continued treatment with PONVORY with values returning to less than three times the ULN within approximately 2–4 weeks. In Study 1, the discontinuation rate because of elevations in hepatic enzymes was 2.3% of patients treated with PONVORY and 1.9% of patients who received teriflunomide 14 mg. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, rash with eosinophilia, or jaundice and/or dark urine during treatment, should have hepatic enzymes checked. PONVORY should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). PONVORY is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B and C, respectively) [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.5 Increased Blood Pressure In Study 1, PONVORY-treated patients had an average increase of 2.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 2.8 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure compared to 2.8 mm Hg and 3.1 mm Hg in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg, respectively. An increase in blood pressure with PONVORY was first detected after approximately 1 month of treatment initiation and persisted with continued treatment. Hypertensive events were reported as an adverse reaction in 10.1% of PONVORY-treated patients and in 9.0% of patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. One patient treated with PONVORY experienced a hypertensive crisis but had evidence of longstanding hypertensive heart disease. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment with PONVORY and managed appropriately. 5.6 Cutaneous Malignancies Cases of basal cell carcinoma and other skin malignancies have been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators, including PONVORY. In Study 1, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma was 0.4% in PONVORY-treated patients compared to 0.2% in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. Cases of other cutaneous malignancies, including melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma, have also been reported in patients treated with PONVORY and in patients treated with other S1P modulators. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer. Providers and patients are advised to monitor for suspicious skin lesions. If a suspicious skin lesion is observed, it should be promptly evaluated. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. Concomitant phototherapy with UV-B radiation or PUVA-photochemotherapy is not recommended in patients taking PONVORY. 5.7 Fetal Risk Based on animal studies, PONVORY may cause fetal harm [see . Because it takes approximately 1 week to eliminate PONVORY from the body, women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception to avoid pregnancy during and for 1 week after stopping PONVORY treatment. Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] 5.8 Macular Edema S1P receptor modulators, including PONVORY, have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. In Study 1, macular edema was reported in 1.1% of PONVORY-treated patients compared to none of the patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. An ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, is recommended in all patients before starting treatment and again at any time if a patient reports any change in vision while on PONVORY therapy. Continuation of PONVORY therapy in patients with macular edema has not been evaluated. A decision on whether PONVORY should be discontinued should take into account the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient. Macular Edema in Patients with a History of Uveitis or Diabetes Mellitus Patients with a history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular edema during therapy with S1P receptor modulators, including PONVORY. Therefore, these patients should have regular follow-up examinations of the fundus, including the macula, during treatment with PONVORY. 5.9 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported in patients receiving a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Such events have not been reported for PONVORY-treated patients in the development program. However, should a PONVORY-treated patient develop any unexpected neurological or psychiatric symptoms/signs (e.g., cognitive deficits, behavioral changes, cortical visual disturbances, or any other neurological cortical symptoms/signs), any symptom/sign suggestive of an increase of intracranial pressure, or accelerated neurological deterioration, the physician should promptly schedule a complete physical and neurological examination and should consider an MRI. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, PONVORY should be discontinued. 5.10 Unintended Additive Immunosuppressive Effects From Prior Treatment With Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Therapies When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered in order to avoid unintended additive effects on the immune system while at the same time minimizing risk of disease reactivation, when initiating PONVORY. Initiating treatment with PONVORY after treatment with alemtuzumab is not recommended. 5.11 Severe Increase in Disability After Stopping PONVORY Severe exacerbation of disease, including disease rebound, has been rarely reported after discontinuation of a S1P receptor modulator. The possibility of severe exacerbation of disease should be considered after stopping PONVORY treatment. Patients should be observed for a severe increase in disability upon PONVORY discontinuation and appropriate treatment should be instituted, as required. After stopping PONVORY in the setting of PML, monitor for development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS) [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 5.12 Immune System Effects After Stopping PONVORY After stopping PONVORY therapy, ponesimod remains in the blood for up to 1 week. Starting other therapies during this interval will result in concomitant exposure to ponesimod. Lymphocyte counts returned to the normal range in 90% of patients within 1 week of stopping PONVORY therapy in modeling studies [see . However, residual pharmacodynamics effects, such as lowering effects on peripheral lymphocyte count, may persist for 1 to 2 weeks after the last dose. Use of immunosuppressants within this period may lead to an additive effect on the immune system, and therefore caution should be applied 1 to 2 weeks after the last dose of PONVORY Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Bradyarrhythmia and Atrioventricular Conduction Delays [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Respiratory Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Increased Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cutaneous Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Fetal Risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Macular Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Unintended Additive Immunosuppressive Effects From Prior Treatment With Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Severe Increase in Disability After Stopping PONVORY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Immune System Effects After Stopping PONVORY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 10%) are upper respiratory tract infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, and hypertension.

A total of 1438 MS patients have received PONVORY at doses of at least 2 mg daily. These patients were included in Study 1 (2-year active-controlled versus teriflunomide 14 mg) [see and in a Phase 2 (6-month placebo-controlled) study in patients with MS and the uncontrolled extension studies. Clinical Studies (14) ] In Study 1, 82% of PONVORY-treated patients completed 2 years of study treatment, compared to 82.2% of patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 8.7% of PONVORY-treated patients, compared to 6% of patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. The most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 10%) in PONVORY-treated patients in Study 1 were upper respiratory tract infection, hepatic transaminase elevation, and hypertension. Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of PONVORY-treated patients and at a higher rate than in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in Study 1 Occurring in at Least 2% of PONVORY-Treated Patients and at a Higher Rate Than in Patients Receiving Teriflunomide 14 mg Adverse Reaction PONVORY Teriflunomide 14 mg N=565 (%) N=566 (%) Upper respiratory infection Includes the following terms: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, respiratory tract infection viral, viral upper respiratory tract infection, tracheitis, and laryngitis. 37 34 Hepatic transaminase elevation Includes the following terms: alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased, and transaminases increased. 23 12 Hypertension Includes the following terms: hypertension, hypertensive crisis, blood pressure increased, blood pressure systolic increased, and blood pressure diastolic increased. 10 9 Urinary tract infection 6 5 Dyspnea 5 1 Dizziness 5 3 Cough 4 2 Pain in extremity 4 3 Somnolence 3 2 Pyrexia 2 1 C-reactive protein increased 2 1 Hypercholesterolemia 2 1 Vertigo 2 1 In Study 1, the following adverse reactions occurred in less than 2% of PONVORY-treated patients, but at a rate at least 1% higher than in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg: viral infection, herpes zoster, hyperkalemia, lymphopenia [see , and macular edema Warnings and Precautions (5.1) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Adverse reactions in patients treated with PONVORY in an additional 6-month placebo-controlled study were generally similar to those in Study 1. The following additional adverse reactions occurred in at least 2% of PONVORY 20 mg-treated patients and at a higher rate than in patients receiving placebo (but did not meet the reporting rate criteria for inclusion in Study 1): rhinitis, fatigue, chest discomfort, peripheral edema, joint swelling, blood cholesterol increased, migraine, insomnia, depression, dyspepsia, dry mouth, bradycardia, back pain, and sinusitis. Additionally, in uncontrolled extension trials, the adverse reaction of pneumonia was reported. Seizures In Study 1, cases of seizures were reported in 1.4% of PONVORY-treated patients, compared to 0.2% in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg. It is not known whether these events were related to the effects of MS, to PONVORY, or to a combination of both. Respiratory Effects In Study 1, dose-dependent reductions in forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV 1 ) were observed in patients treated with PONVORY [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Malignancies In Study 1, two cases of basal cell carcinoma (0.4%) were reported in PONVORY-treated patients, compared to one case of basal cell carcinoma (0.2%) in patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg, and a case of malignant melanoma was reported in a PONVORY-treated patient. An increased risk of cutaneous malignancies has been reported in association with other S1P receptor modulators, including PONVORY [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]"
