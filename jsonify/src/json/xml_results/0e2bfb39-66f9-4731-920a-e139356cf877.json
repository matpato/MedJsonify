    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE UPLIZNA is a CD19-directed cytolytic antibody indicated for: The treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. ( 1.1 ) The treatment of Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) in adult patients. ( 1.2 ) 1.1\tNeuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) UPLIZNA is indicated for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adult patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. 1.2\tImmunoglobulin G4-Related Disease (IgG4-RD) UPLIZNA is indicated for the treatment of Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) in adult patients.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS UPLIZNA is contraindicated in patients with: A history of a life-threatening infusion reaction to UPLIZNA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Active hepatitis B infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Active or untreated latent tuberculosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Previous life-threatening reaction to infusion of UPLIZNA ( 4 ) Active hepatitis B infection ( 4 ) Active or untreated latent tuberculosis ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion reactions: Administer premedications prior to infusion. ( 2.2 ) Management recommendations for infusion reactions depend on the type and severity of the reaction. Permanently discontinue UPLIZNA if a life-threatening or disabling infusion reaction occurs. ( 5.1 ) Infections: Delay UPLIZNA administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and after discontinuation, until B-cell repletion. ( 5.2 ) Immunoglobulin levels: Monitor the level of immunoglobulins at the beginning, during, and after discontinuation of treatment with UPLIZNA until B-cell repletion. Consider discontinuing UPLIZNA if a patient develops a serious opportunistic infection or recurrent infections if immunoglobulin levels indicate immune compromise. ( 5.3 ) Fetal Risk: May cause fetal harm based on animal data. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for 6 months after stopping UPLIZNA. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) 5.1\tInfusion Reactions UPLIZNA can cause infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis. Symptoms can include headache, nausea, somnolence, dyspnea, fever, myalgia, rash, or palpitations. During the randomized clinical trial period, infusion reactions were observed with the first course of UPLIZNA in 9.3% of NMOSD patients. Infusion reactions of UPLIZNA were observed in 7.4% of IgG4-RD patients during the randomized controlled period. Infusion reactions were most common with the first infusion but were also observed during subsequent infusions. Reducing the Risk of Infusion Reactions and Managing Infusion Reactions Administer pre-medication with a corticosteroid, an antihistamine, and an antipyretic [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Management recommendations for infusion reactions depend on the type and severity of the reaction . For life-threatening infusion reactions, immediately and permanently stop UPLIZNA and administer appropriate supportive treatment. For less severe infusion reactions, management may involve temporarily stopping the infusion, reducing the infusion rate, and/or administering symptomatic treatment. 5.2\tInfections An increased risk of infections has been observed with other B-cell depleting therapies. The most common infections reported by UPLIZNA-treated patients in the randomized and open-label clinical trial periods for NMOSD included urinary tract infection (20%), nasopharyngitis (13%), upper respiratory tract infection (8%), and influenza (7%). In the IgG4-RD randomized controlled and open-label periods, the most common infections reported by UPLIZNA-treated patients were upper respiratory tract infection (11%), nasopharyngitis (10%), urinary tract infection (9%), and influenza (6%). Delay UPLIZNA administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. Possible Increased Risk of Immunosuppressant Effects with Other Immunosuppressants UPLIZNA has not been studied in combination with other immunosuppressants. If combining UPLIZNA with another immunosuppressive therapy, consider the potential for increased immunosuppressive effects. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation Risk of HBV reactivation has been observed with other B-cell depleting antibodies. There have been no cases of HBV reactivation in patients treated with UPLIZNA, but patients with chronic HBV infection were excluded from clinical trials. Perform HBV screening in all patients before initiation of treatment with UPLIZNA. Do not administer UPLIZNA to patients with active hepatitis. For patients who are chronic carriers of HBV [HBsAg+], consult liver disease experts before starting and during treatment. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Although no confirmed cases of PML were identified in UPLIZNA clinical trials, JC virus infection resulting in PML has been observed in patients treated with other B-cell depleting antibodies and other therapies that affect immune competence. In UPLIZNA clinical trials one subject died following the development of new brain lesions for which a definitive diagnosis could not be established, though the differential diagnosis included an atypical NMOSD relapse, PML, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold UPLIZNA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. Tuberculosis Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to initiating UPLIZNA. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of UPLIZNA in patients with a history of latent active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consult infectious disease experts regarding whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate before starting treatment. Vaccinations Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines at least 4 weeks prior to initiation of UPLIZNA. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines following UPLIZNA therapy has not been studied, and vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell repletion. Vaccination of Infants Born to Mothers Treated with UPLIZNA During Pregnancy In infants of mothers exposed to UPLIZNA during pregnancy, do not administer live or live-attenuated vaccines before confirming recovery of B-cell counts in the infant. Depletion of B-cells in these exposed infants may increase the risks from live or live-attenuated vaccines. Non-live vaccines, as indicated, may be administered prior to recovery from B-cell and immunoglobulin level depletion, but consultation with a qualified specialist should be considered to assess whether a protective immune response was mounted [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.3\tReduction in Immunoglobulins There may be a progressive and prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia or decline in the levels of total and individual immunoglobulins such as immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) with continued UPLIZNA treatment [see Monitor the levels of quantitative serum immunoglobulins during treatment with UPLIZNA, especially in patients with opportunistic or recurrent infections, and until B-cell repletion after discontinuation of therapy. Consider discontinuing UPLIZNA therapy if a patient with low immunoglobulin G or M develops a serious opportunistic infection or recurrent infections, or if prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia requires treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.4\tFetal Risk Based on animal data, UPLIZNA can cause fetal harm due to B-cell lymphopenia and reduce antibody response in offspring exposed to UPLIZNA even after B-cell repletion. Transient peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in infants born to mothers exposed to other B-cell depleting antibodies during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving UPLIZNA and for at least 6 months after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Infusion Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Reduction in Immunoglobulins [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions in NMOSD (at least 10% of patients treated with UPLIZNA and greater than placebo) were urinary tract infection and arthralgia.

Laboratory Abnormalities Decreased Immunoglobulins NMOSD At the end of the 6.5-month randomized, controlled period, relative to baseline, the total immunoglobulin level was reduced approximately 8% from baseline for patients treated with UPLIZNA as compared to an increase of 6% in patients treated with placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were approximately 4% and 32%, respectively, in patients treated with UPLIZNA, whereas IgG was increased by 6% and IgM was increased by approximately 13% in placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients treated with UPLIZNA who had IgG levels below the lower limit of normal at year 1 was 6.6% and at year 2 was 13%. The proportion of patients treated with UPLIZNA who had IgM levels below the lower limit of normal at year 1 was 31% and at year 2 was 42%. IgG4-RD At the end of the 12-month randomized, controlled period, relative to baseline, the total immunoglobulin level was reduced approximately 12% from baseline for patients treated with UPLIZNA as compared to an increase of 21% in patients treated with placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were approximately 9% and 32%, respectively, in patients treated with UPLIZNA, whereas IgG was increased by 26% and IgM was increased by approximately 3% in placebo-treated patients. Decreased Neutrophil Counts NMOSD Neutrophil counts between 1.0-1.5 × 10 9 /L were observed in 6.9% of UPLIZNA-treated patients versus 1.9% of patients who received placebo. Neutrophil counts between 0.5-1.0 × 10 9 /L were observed in 1.9% of patients treated with UPLIZNA compared to no patients who received placebo. At the end of the 6.5-month randomized, controlled period, the proportion of patients with a neutrophil count below the limit of normal was 12% for patients treated with UPLIZNA compared to 4.2% for patients who received placebo. IgG4-RD During the 12-month randomized, controlled period, neutrophil counts between 1.0-1.5 × 10 9 /L were observed in 7.5% of UPLIZNA-treated patients versus 3% of patients who received placebo. Neutrophil counts between 0.5-1.0 × 10 9 /L were observed in 1.5% of patients treated with placebo compared to no patients who received UPLIZNA. Decreased Lymphocyte Counts NMOSD A reduction in lymphocyte counts was observed more frequently in patients treated with UPLIZNA compared to those who received placebo. At the end of the 6.5-month randomized, controlled period, the proportion of patients with a lymphocyte count below the limit of normal was 5.3% for patients treated with UPLIZNA compared to 4.2% for patients who received placebo. IgG4-RD A reduction in lymphocyte counts was observed more frequently in patients treated with UPLIZNA compared to those who received placebo. During the 12-month randomized, controlled period, the proportion of patients with a lymphocyte count below the limit of normal was 41.8% for patients treated with UPLIZNA compared to 35.8% for patients who received placebo."
