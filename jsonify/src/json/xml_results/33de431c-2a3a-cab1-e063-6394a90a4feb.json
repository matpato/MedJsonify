    "indications": "INDICATION AND USAGE : Nestabs® One is a prescription prenatal multi-vitamin/mineral supplement with DHA that can be taken throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period for both lactating and non-lactating mothers. Nestabs® One may also be useful in improving the nutritional status of women prior to conception. The usual dose is one softgel daily, or as directed by a physician.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS : This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS : Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day has been shown to have potential antithrombotic effects, including increased bleeding time and INR. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids should be avoided in patients on anticoagulants and in those known to have an inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis. Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B12 is deficient.PRECAUTIONS : Folic acid in doses above 0.1mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS : Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid."
