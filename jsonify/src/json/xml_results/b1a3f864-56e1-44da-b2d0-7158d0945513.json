    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Neurologic Adverse Reactions : Severe neurologic reactions have been reported. Monitor for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity. ( 5.1 ) • Hematologic Reactions : Complete blood counts including platelets should be monitored regularly. ( 5.2 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception; and advise males to use condoms. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) • Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines : Somnolence may occur. Advise patients to refrain from these activities until somnolence has resolved. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Neurologic Adverse Reactions Nervous system adverse reactions of any grade were reported for 223 (76%) adult patients across the Phase I and Phase II trials, and Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) adverse reactions were reported for 55 (19%) patients following initiation of ARRANON therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( . Based on patients with complete data, the median time to onset of first event is 5 days from start of first infusion (range: 1-166), and the median duration is 6 days (range: 1-393 days). 6.1 )] Nervous system adverse reactions of any grade were reported for 69 (42%) pediatric patients across the Phase I and Phase II trials, and Grade 3 or higher (severe, life-threatening, or fatal) adverse reactions were reported for 25 (15%) patients following initiation of ARRANON therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( . Based on patients with complete data, the median time to onset of first event is 8 days from start of first infusion (range: 1-269), and the median duration is 2 days (range: 1-82 days). 6.1 )] Common signs and symptoms of ARRANON-related neurotoxicity include somnolence, headache, paresthesia and dysesthesia, dizziness, neuropathy (sensory and motor), cerebellar disturbances and tremor. Severe neurologic toxicity can manifest as coma, status epilepticus, craniospinal demyelination, or ascending neuropathy similar in presentation to Guillain-Barré syndrome. Full recovery from these adverse reactions has not always occurred with cessation of therapy with ARRANON. Patients treated previously or concurrently with intrathecal chemotherapy or previously with craniospinal irradiation may be at increased risk for neurologic adverse events. Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicity during and for at least 24 hours after completion of treatment with ARRANON. Discontinue ARRANON for neurologic adverse reactions of NCI CTCAE Grade 2 or greater and provide supportive care [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] 5.2 Hematologic Adverse Reactions Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, have been associated with ARRANON therapy. Complete blood counts including platelets should be monitored regularly [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, ARRANON can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of nelarabine to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity at maternal doses below the recommended human adult dose of 1,500 mg/m 2 /day (see Data) . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ARRANON. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with ARRANON and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patients receiving ARRANON should receive intravenous hydration according to standard medical practice for the management of hyperuricemia in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome. Consideration should be given to the use of allopurinol in patients at risk of hyperuricemia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.5 Vaccinations Avoid the administration of live vaccines to immunocompromised patients. 5.6 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines Patients treated with ARRANON may experience somnolence during and for several days after treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Advise patients to refrain from driving or engaging in hazardous occupations or activities until somnolence has resolved.",

Relapsed or Refractory T-ALL and T-LBL ARRANON was studied in 459 patients in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. The safety profile of ARRANON is based on data from 103 adult patients treated with the recommended dose and schedule in 2 studies: an adult T-ALL/T-cell T-LBL trial and an adult chronic lymphocytic leukemia trial. Adult Patient : The most common adverse reactions in adults were fatigue; gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation); hematologic disorders (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia); respiratory disorders (cough and dyspnea); nervous system disorders (somnolence and dizziness); and pyrexia.

The safety profile for children is based on data from 84 pediatric patients treated with the recommended dose and schedule in a T-ALL/T-LBL treatment trial. Pediatric Patient : The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients were hematologic disorders (anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia). Of the non-hematologic adverse reactions in pediatric patients, the most frequent adverse reactions reported were headache, increased transaminase levels, decreased blood potassium, decreased blood albumin, increased blood bilirubin, and vomiting.

The other Grade 3 neurologic adverse reaction in pediatric patients was hypertonia reported in 1 patient (1%). The additional Grade 4 neurologic adverse reactions, were third nerve paralysis, and sixth nerve paralysis, each reported in 1 patient (1%). The other neurologic adverse reactions reported as Grade 1, 2, or unknown in pediatric patients were dysarthria, encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, hyporeflexia, lethargy, mental impairment, paralysis, and sensory loss, each reported in 1 patient (1%). ARRANON in Combination with Multi-Agent Chemotherapy in T-ALL and T-LBL ARRANON was studied in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy in a randomized clinical trial [NCT00408005]. The safety population in this trial included 804 patients with newly-diagnosed T-ALL (85%) or T-LBL (15%) treated with (n = 411) or without (n =393) ARRANON in combination with the augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster chemotherapy regimen (aBFM) after initial induction therapy. Patients assigned to ARRANON received 650 mg/m 2 intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days, during consolidation Days 1 to 5 and 43 to 47, delayed intensification Days 29 to 33, and during the initial 3 courses of maintenance Days 29 to 33. The median age on enrollment was 9.5 years (range: 1-29), the majority of patients were male (73%) and white (69%). Sixty-five percent of patients assigned to the ARRANON arms received at least 85% of the planned dose through the third course of maintenance therapy compared to 79% of patients on the control arms who received 3 courses of maintenance therapy. There was one fatal neurological adverse reaction in the ARRANON arm. The incidence of the following Grades 3 and 4 adverse reactions were higher in the ARRANON treated arms compared to the control arms: abnormal transaminases, motor and sensory neuropathy, nausea and vomiting, and dehydration. The incidence of seizures of any grade was 3% (14 of 411). Rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed in 2% (7 of 411) of ARRANON treated patients and occurred after the first course of ARRANON during the consolidation phase of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ARRANON. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations : Fatal opportunistic infections Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Tumor lysis syndrome Nervous System Disorders : Demyelination and ascending peripheral neuropathies similar in appearance to Guillain-Barré syndrome Musculoskeletal and Connective Disorders : Rhabdomyolysis, blood creatine phosphokinase increased"
