    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PROGRAF is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult and pediatric patients receiving allogeneic liver, kidney, heart, or lung transplants, in combination with other immunosuppressants. ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection in Kidney, Liver, Heart, or Lung Transplant PROGRAF ® is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection, in adult and pediatric patients receiving allogeneic kidney transplant [see liver transplant Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )], [see heart transplant Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )], [see or lung transplant Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )], [see in combination with other immunosuppressants. Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )]",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS PROGRAF is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to tacrolimus. PROGRAF injection is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to HCO-60 (polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil). Hypersensitivity symptoms reported include dyspnea, rash, pruritus, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] • Hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or HCO-60 (polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil). ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Not Interchangeable with Extended-Release Tacrolimus Products - Medication Errors: Instruct patients or caregivers to recognize the appearance of PROGRAF capsules. ( 5.3 ) • New Onset Diabetes After Transplant: Monitor blood glucose. ( 5.4 ) • Nephrotoxicity (acute and/or chronic): Reduce the dose; use caution with other nephrotoxic drugs. ( 5.5 ) • Neurotoxicity: Including risk of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES); monitor for neurologic abnormalities; reduce or discontinue PROGRAF. ( 5.6 ) • Hyperkalemia: Monitor serum potassium levels. Consider carefully before using with other agents also associated with hyperkalemia. ( 5.7 ) • Hypertension: May require antihypertensive therapy. Monitor relevant drug-drug interactions. ( 5.8 ) • Anaphylactic Reactions with IV formulation: Observe patients receiving PROGRAF injection for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. ( 5.9 ) • Not recommended for use with sirolimus: Not recommended in liver and heart transplant due to increased risk of serious adverse reactions. ( 5.10 ) • Myocardial Hypertrophy: Consider dose reduction/discontinuation. ( 5.13 ) • Immunizations: Avoid live vaccines. ( 5.14 ) • Pure Red Cell Aplasia: Consider discontinuation of PROGRAF. ( 5.15 ) • Thrombotic Microangiopathy, Including Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: May occur, especially in patients with infections and certain concomitant medications. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including PROGRAF, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin . The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, examine patients for skin changes; exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. Monitor EBV serology during treatment. 5.2 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including PROGRAF, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Serious viral infections reported include: • Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), mostly due to BK virus infection • JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) • Cytomegalovirus infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor disease are at higher risk of developing CMV viremia and CMV disease. Monitor for the development of infection and adjust the immunosuppressive regimen to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. 5.3 Not Interchangeable with Extended-Release Tacrolimus Products - Medication Errors Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between tacrolimus immediate-release products and tacrolimus extended-release products were reported outside the U.S. This led to serious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, or other adverse reactions due to under- or overexposure to tacrolimus. PROGRAF is not interchangeable or substitutable for tacrolimus extended-release products. Changes between tacrolimus immediate-release and extended-release dosage forms must occur under physician supervision. Instruct patients and caregivers to recognize the appearance of PROGRAF dosage forms [see and to confirm with the healthcare provider if a different product is dispensed Dosage Forms and Strengths ( 3 )] . 5.4 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant PROGRAF was shown to cause new onset diabetes mellitus in clinical trials of kidney, liver, heart, or lung transplantation. New onset diabetes after transplantation may be reversible in some patients. African-American and Hispanic kidney transplant patients are at an increased risk. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using PROGRAF [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] 5 .5 Nephrotoxicity due to PROGRAF and Drug Interactions PROGRAF, like other calcineurin inhibitors, can cause acute or chronic nephrotoxicity in transplant patients due to its vasoconstrictive effect on renal vasculature, toxic tubulopathy and tubular-interstitial effects. Nephrotoxicity was reported in clinical trials [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] Acute renal impairment associated with tacrolimus toxicity can result in high serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, decreased secretion of urea and hyperuricemia, and is usually reversible. In patients with elevated serum creatinine and tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than the recommended range, consider dosage reduction or temporary interruption of tacrolimus administration. The risk for nephrotoxicity may increase when PROGRAF is concomitantly administered with CYP3A inhibitors (by increasing tacrolimus whole blood concentrations) or drugs associated with nephrotoxicity (e.g., aminoglycosides, ganciclovir, amphotericin B, cisplatin, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors). When tacrolimus is used concurrently with other known nephrotoxic drugs, monitor renal function and tacrolimus blood concentrations, and adjust doses of both tacrolimus and/or concomitant medications during concurrent use [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] 5.6 Neurotoxicity PROGRAF may cause a spectrum of neurotoxicities. The most severe neurotoxicities include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), delirium, seizure and coma; others include tremors, paresthesias, headache, mental status changes, and changes in motor and sensory functions [see . As symptoms may be associated with tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations at or above the recommended range, monitor for neurologic symptoms and consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of PROGRAF if neurotoxicity occurs. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] 5.7 Hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia has been reported with PROGRAF use. Serum potassium levels should be monitored. Careful consideration should be given prior to use of other agents also associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) during PROGRAF therapy [see . Monitor serum potassium levels periodically during treatment. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] 5.8 Hypertension Hypertension is a common adverse effect of PROGRAF therapy and may require antihypertensive therapy [see The control of blood pressure can be accomplished with any of the common antihypertensive agents, though careful consideration should be given prior to use of antihypertensive agents associated with hyperkalemia (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. [see . Calcium-channel blocking agents may increase tacrolimus blood concentrations and therefore require dosage reduction of PROGRAF Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )]. 5.9 Anaphylactic Reactions with PROGRAF Injection Anaphylactic reactions have occurred with injectables containing castor oil derivatives, including PROGRAF, in a small percentage of patients (0.6%). The exact cause of these reactions is not known. PROGRAF injection should be reserved for patients who are unable to take PROGRAF orally. Monitor patients for anaphylaxis when using the intravenous route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. 5 .10 Not Recommended for Use with Sirolimus PROGRAF is not recommended for use with sirolimus: •     The use of sirolimus with PROGRAF in studies of de novo liver transplant patients was associated with an excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), and is not recommended. •     The use of sirolimus (2 mg per day) with PROGRAF in heart transplant patients in a U.S. trial was associated with increased risk of renal function impairment, wound healing complications, and insulin-dependent post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] •     The use of sirolimus with PROGRAF may increase the risk of thrombotic microangiopathy [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] 5.11 Interactions with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers When co-administering PROGRAF with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin) and strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin), adjustments in the dosing regimen of PROGRAF and subsequent frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations and tacrolimus-associated adverse reactions are recommended. A rapid, sharp rise in tacrolimus levels has been reported after co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, clarithromycin, despite an initial reduction of tacrolimus dose. Early and frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough levels is recommended [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] 5.12 QT Prolongation PROGRAF may prolong the QT/QTc interval and may cause Torsades de pointes . Avoid PROGRAF in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. In patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, those taking certain antiarrhythmic medications or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation, and those with electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hypomagnesemia, consider obtaining electrocardiograms and monitoring electrolytes (magnesium, potassium, calcium) periodically during treatment. When co-administering PROGRAF with other substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 that also have the potential to prolong the QT interval, a reduction in PROGRAF dose, frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations, and monitoring for QT prolongation is recommended. Use of PROGRAF with amiodarone has been reported to result in increased tacrolimus whole blood concentrations with or without concurrent QT prolongation [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )] 5.13 Myocardial Hypertrophy Myocardial hypertrophy has been reported in infants, children, and adults, particularly those with high tacrolimus trough concentrations, and is generally manifested by echocardiographically demonstrated concentric increases in left ventricular posterior wall and interventricular septum thickness. This condition appears reversible in most cases following dose reduction or discontinuance of therapy. In patients who develop renal failure or clinical manifestations of ventricular dysfunction while receiving PROGRAF therapy, echocardiographic evaluation should be considered. If myocardial hypertrophy is diagnosed, dosage reduction or discontinuation of PROGRAF should be considered [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] 5.14 Immunizations Whenever possible, administer the complete complement of vaccines before transplantation and treatment with PROGRAF. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with tacrolimus; examples include (not limited to) the following: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. Inactivated vaccines noted to be safe for administration after transplantation may not be sufficiently immunogenic during treatment with PROGRAF. 5.15 Pure Red Cell Aplasia Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. A mechanism for tacrolimus-induced PRCA has not been elucidated. All patients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, underlying disease, or concomitant medications associated with PRCA. If PRCA is diagnosed, discontinuation of PROGRAF should be considered [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] 5.16 Thrombotic Microangiopathy (Including Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), including hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), have been reported in patients treated with PROGRAF. TMA may have a multifactorial etiology. Risk factors for TMA that can occur in transplant patients include, for example, severe infections, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) mismatch, the use of calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. These risk factors may, either alone or combined, contribute to the risk of TMA. In patients with signs and symptoms of TMA, consider tacrolimus as a risk factor. Concurrent use of tacrolimus and mTOR inhibitors may contribute to the risk of TMA. 5.17 Cannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and PROGRAF are co-administered, closely monitor for an increase in tacrolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of tacrolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of PROGRAF should be considered as needed when PROGRAF is co-administered with cannabidiol [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.6 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ] .",

In addition, the clinical trials were not designed to establish comparative differences across study arms with regards to the adverse reactions discussed below. Kidney Transplantation The incidence of adverse reactions was determined in three randomized kidney transplant trials. One of the trials used azathioprine (AZA) and corticosteroids and two of the trials used mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids concomitantly for maintenance immunosuppression. PROGRAF-based immunosuppression in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids following kidney transplantation was assessed in a trial where 205 patients received PROGRAF-based immunosuppression and 207 patients received cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. The trial population had a mean age of 43 years (mean ± SD was 43 ± 13 years on PROGRAF and 44 ± 12 years on cyclosporine arm), the distribution was 61% male, and the composition was White (58%), African-American (25%), Hispanic (12%), and Other (5%). The 12-month post-transplant information from this trial is presented below. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 30%) observed in PROGRAF-treated kidney transplant patients are: infection, tremor, hypertension, abnormal renal function, constipation, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, insomnia, nausea, hypomagnesemia, urinary tract infection, hypophosphatemia, peripheral edema, asthenia, pain, hyperlipidemia, hyperkalemia, and anemia. Based on reported adverse reaction terms related to decreased renal function, nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 52% of kidney transplantation patients. Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 15% of kidney transplant patients treated with PROGRAF in conjunction with azathioprine are presented below: Table 4.

In the non-US trial (Study 1), the incidence of adverse reactions was based on 1195 kidney transplant patients that received PROGRAF (Group C, n = 403), or one of two cyclosporine (CsA) regimens (Group A, n = 384 and Group B, n = 408) in combination with MMF and corticosteroids; all patients, except those in one of the two cyclosporine groups, also received induction with daclizumab. The trial population had a mean age of 46 years (range 17 to 76); the distribution was 65% male, and the composition was 93% Caucasian. The 12-month post-transplant information from this trial is presented below. Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 10% of kidney transplant patients treated with PROGRAF in conjunction with MMF in Study 1 [Note: This trial was conducted entirely outside of the United States. Such trials often report a lower incidence of adverse reactions in comparison to U.S. trials] are presented below: Table 5.

In the U.S. trial, 263 adult and pediatric patients received tacrolimus and steroids and 266 patients received cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen (CsA/AZA). The trial population had a mean age of 44 years (range 0.4 to 70); the distribution was 52% male, and the composition was White (78%), African-American (5%), Asian (2%), Hispanic (13%), and Other (2%). In the European trial, 270 patients received tacrolimus and steroids and 275 patients received CsA/AZA. The trial population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 68); the distribution was 59% male, and the composition was White (95.4%), Black (1%), Asian (2%), and Other (2%). The proportion of patients reporting more than one adverse event was > 99% in both the tacrolimus group and the CsA/AZA group. Precautions must be taken when comparing the incidence of adverse reactions in the U.S. trial to that in the European trial. The 12-month post-transplant information from the U.S. trial and from the European trial is presented below. The two trials also included different patient populations and patients were treated with immunosuppressive regimens of differing intensities. Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 15% in tacrolimus patients (combined trial results) are presented below for the two controlled trials in liver transplantation. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 40%) observed in PROGRAF-treated liver transplant patients are: tremor, headache, diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, abnormal renal function, abdominal pain, insomnia, paresthesia, anemia, pain, fever, asthenia, hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperglycemia. These all occur with oral and IV administration of PROGRAF and some may respond to a reduction in dosing (e.g., tremor, headache, paresthesia, hypertension). Diarrhea was sometimes associated with other gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea and vomiting. Based on reported adverse reaction terms related to decreased renal function, nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 40% and 36% of liver transplantation patients receiving PROGRAF in the U.S. and European randomized trials.

In a trial conducted in Europe, 314 patients received a regimen of antibody induction, corticosteroids, and azathioprine (AZA) in combination with PROGRAF (n = 157) or cyclosporine (n = 157) for 18 months. The trial population had a mean age of 51 years (range 18 to 65); the distribution was 82% male, and the composition was White (96%), Black (3%), and Other (1%). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 15%) observed in PROGRAF-treated heart transplant patients are: abnormal renal function, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, CMV infection, tremor, hyperglycemia, leukopenia, infection, anemia, bronchitis, pericardial effusion, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipemia. Based on reported adverse reaction terms related to decreased renal function, nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 59% of heart transplantation patients in the European trial. Adverse reactions in heart transplant patients in the European trial are presented below: Table 9. Heart Transplantation: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 15% of Patients Treated with PROGRAF in Conjunction with Azathioprine (AZA) PROGRAF/AZA (N = 157) Cyclosporine/AZA (N = 157) Cardiovascular System Hypertension 62% 69% Pericardial Effusion 15% 14% Body as a Whole CMV Infection 32% 30% Infection 24% 21% Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Diabetes Mellitus 26% 16% Hyperglycemia 23% 17% Hyperlipemia 18% 27% Hemic and Lymphatic System Anemia 50% 36% Leukopenia 48% 39% Urogenital System Kidney Function Abnormal 56% 57% Urinary Tract Infection 16% 12% Respiratory System Bronchitis 17% 18% Nervous System Tremor 15% 6% In the European trial, the cyclosporine trough concentrations were above the pre-defined target range (i.e., 100 to 200 ng/mL) at Day 122 and beyond in 32% to 68% of the patients in the cyclosporine treatment arm, whereas the tacrolimus trough concentrations were within the pre-defined target range (i.e., 5 to 15 ng/mL) in 74% to 86% of the patients in the tacrolimus treatment arm. In a U.S. trial, the incidence of adverse reactions was based on 331 heart transplant patients that received corticosteroids and PROGRAF in combination with sirolimus (n=109), PROGRAF in combination with MMF (n=107) or cyclosporine modified in combination with MMF (n=115) for 1 year. The trial population had a mean age of 53 years (range 18 to 75); the distribution was 78% male, and the composition was White (83%), African-American (13%) and Other (4%). Only selected targeted treatment-emergent adverse reactions were collected in the U.S. heart transplantation trial. Those reactions that were reported at a rate of 15% or greater in patients treated with PROGRAF and MMF include the following: any target adverse reactions (99%), hypertension (89%), hyperglycemia requiring antihyperglycemic therapy (70%) , hypertriglyceridemia (65%), anemia (hemoglobin < 10.0 g/dL) (65%), fasting blood glucose > 140 mg/dL (on two separate occasions) (61%), hypercholesterolemia (57%), hyperlipidemia (34%), WBCs < 3000 cells/mcL (34%), serious bacterial infections (30%), magnesium < 1.2 mEq/L (24%), platelet count < 75,000 cells/mcL (19%), and other opportunistic infections (15%). Other targeted treatment-emergent adverse reactions in PROGRAF-treated patients occurred at a rate of less than 15%, and include the following: Cushingoid features, impaired wound healing, hyperkalemia, Candida infection, and CMV infection/syndrome. Other less frequently observed adverse reactions in heart transplantation patients are described under the subsection “Less Frequently Reported Adverse Reactions (> 3% and < 15%) in Liver, Kidney and Heart Transplant Studies.” New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Kidney Transplantation New Onset Diabetes After Transplant (NODAT) is defined as a composite of fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, HbA 1C ≥ 6%, insulin use ≥ 30 days, or oral hypoglycemic use. In a trial in kidney transplant patients (Study 2), NODAT was observed in 75% in the PROGRAF-treated and 61% in the NEORAL-treated patients without pre-transplant history of diabetes mellitus ( Table 10 ) [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] Table 10.

Data are presented in Tables 11 to 14 . PTDM was reported in 20% of PROGRAF/Azathioprine (AZA)-treated kidney transplant patients without pre-transplant history of diabetes mellitus in a Phase 3 trial ( Table 11 ). The median time to onset of PTDM was 68 days. Insulin dependence was reversible in 15% of these PTDM patients at one year and in 50% at 2 years post-transplant. African-American and Hispanic kidney transplant patients were at an increased risk of development of PTDM ( Table 12 ). Table 11.

Hyperglycemia was associated with the use of PROGRAF in 47% and 33% of liver transplant recipients in the U.S. and European randomized trials, respectively, and may require treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )].

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of the reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to the drug. Other reactions include: • Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, electrocardiogram T wave abnormal, flushing, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, pericardial effusion, QT prolongation, Torsades de pointes , venous thrombosis deep limb, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular fibrillation, myocardial hypertrophy • Gastrointestinal: Bile duct stenosis, colitis, enterocolitis, gastroenteritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hepatic cytolysis, hepatic necrosis, hepatotoxicity, impaired gastric emptying, liver fatty, mouth ulceration, pancreatitis hemorrhagic, pancreatitis necrotizing, stomach ulcer, veno-occlusive liver disease • Hemic/Lymphatic: Agranulocytosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolytic anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, pure red cell aplasia, thrombotic microangiopathy • Infections: Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal; polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) including graft loss • Metabolic/Nutritional: Glycosuria, increased amylase including pancreatitis, weight decreased • Miscellaneous: Feeling hot and cold, feeling jittery, hot flushes, multi-organ failure, primary graft dysfunction • Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Pain in extremity including Calcineurin-Inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) • Nervous System: Carpal tunnel syndrome, cerebral infarction, hemiparesis, leukoencephalopathy, mental disorder, mutism, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), quadriplegia, speech disorder, syncope • Respiratory: Acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial lung disease, lung infiltration, respiratory distress, respiratory failure • Skin: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis • Special Senses: Blindness, optic neuropathy, blindness cortical, hearing loss including deafness, photophobia • Urogenital: Acute renal failure, cystitis hemorrhagic, hemolytic-uremic syndrome Postmarketing Adverse Reactions in Lung Transplantation Based on U.S. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) data, published clinical trials, and postmarketing reports, the safety profile for lung transplant patients treated with PROGRAF is consistent with the safety profile in kidney, liver, and heart transplant patients treated with PROGRAF. The primary adverse reactions described include renal dysfunction, infection, diabetes, gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., diarrhea), hypertension, and neurological events (e.g., tremor). As expected, lung transplant patients have a higher incidence of pulmonary complications (e.g., pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) than other solid organ transplant patients, which is in part due to the underlying disease and to the nature of the transplanted organ."
