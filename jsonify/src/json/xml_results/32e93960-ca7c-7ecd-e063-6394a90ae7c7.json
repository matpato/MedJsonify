    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fenofibrate is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet: To reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG and Apo B, and to increase HDL-­C in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. ( 1.1 ) For treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. ( 1.2 ) Limitations of Use: Fenofibrate was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ( 5.1 ) 1.1 Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia Fenofibrate tablets are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), Triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. 1.2 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia Fenofibrate tablets are also indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacologic intervention. Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g., > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibrate therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied. 1.3 Important Limitations of Use Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 160 mg of fenofibrate tablet was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in a large, randomized controlled trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Fenofibrate tablets are contraindicated in: patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis [see . Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] patients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. patients with preexisting gallbladder disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. nursing mothers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ]. patients with known hypersensitivity to fenofibrate or fenofibric acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Severe renal dysfunction, including dialysis patients. ( 4 , 8.6 , 12.3 ) Active liver disease. ( 4 , 5.3 ) Gallbladder disease. ( 4 , 5.5 ) Known hypersensitivity to fenofibrate. ( 4 ) Nursing mothers. ( 4 , 8.2 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity: Serious drug-induced liver injury, including liver transplantation and death, has been reported with fenofibrate. Monitor patient’s liver function including serum ALT, AST and total bilirubin, at baseline and periodically for the duration of therapy. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of liver injury develop or if elevated enzyme levels persist. ( 5.2 ). Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Have been reported in patients taking fenofibrate. Risks are increased during co-administration with a statin (with a significantly higher rate observed for gemfibrozil), particularly in elderly patients and patients with diabetes, renal failure, or hypothyroidism. ( 5.3 ) Serum Creatinine: Fenofibrate can reversibly increase serum creatinine levels ( 5.4 ). Monitor renal function periodically in patients with renal impairment. ( 8.6 ) Cholelithiasis: Fenofibrate increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to risk of cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. ( 5.5 ) Coumarin Anticoagulants: Use caution in concomitant treatment with oral coumarin anticoagulants. Adjust the dosage of coumarin anticoagulant to maintain the prothrombin time/INR at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Acute hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, and delayed hypersensitivity reactions, including severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions have been reported postmarketing. Some cases were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. Discontinue fenofibrate and treat patients appropriately if reactions occur. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Mortality and Coronary Heart Disease Morbidity The effect of fenofibrate on coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and non-cardiovascular mortality has not been established. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Lipid (ACCORD Lipid) trial was a randomized placebo-controlled study of 5,518 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on background statin therapy treated with fenofibrate. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.7 years. Fenofibrate plus statin combination therapy showed a non-significant 8% relative risk reduction in the primary outcome of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular disease death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.08) (p = 0.32) as compared to statin monotherapy. In a gender subgroup analysis, the hazard ratio for MACE in men receiving combination therapy versus statin monotherapy was 0.82 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.99), and the hazard ratio for MACE in women receiving combination therapy versus statin monotherapy was 1.38 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.94) (interaction p = 0.01). The clinical significance of this subgroup finding is unclear. The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study was a 5-year randomized, placebo-controlled study of 9,795 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with fenofibrate. Fenofibrate demonstrated a non-significant 11% relative reduction in the primary outcome of coronary heart disease events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.05, p = 0.16) and a significant 11% reduction in the secondary outcome of total cardiovascular disease events (HR 0.89 [0.8 to 0.99], p = 0.04). There was a non-significant 11% (HR 1.11 [0.95, 1.29], p = 0.18) and 19% (HR 1.19 [0.9, 1.57], p = 0.22) increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, with fenofibrate as compared to placebo. Because of chemical, pharmacological and clinical similarities between fenofibrate, clofibrate and gemfibrozil, the adverse findings in 4 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies with these other fibrate drugs may also apply to fenofibrate. In the Coronary Drug Project, a large study of post myocardial infarction of patients treated for 5 years with clofibrate, there was no difference in mortality seen between the clofibrate group and the placebo group. There was however, a difference in the rate of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis requiring surgery between the two groups (3% vs. 1.8%). In a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), 5,000 subjects without known coronary artery disease were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional one year. There was a statistically significant, higher age − adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.7% vs. 3.96%, p = < 0.01). Excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and pancreatitis. This appeared to confirm the higher risk of gallbladder disease seen in clofibrate-treated patients studied in the Coronary Drug Project. The Helsinki Heart Study was a large (n = 4,081) study of middle-aged men without a history of coronary artery disease. Subjects received either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5 year open extension afterward. Total mortality was numerically higher in the gemfibrozil randomization group but did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.19, 95% confidence interval for relative risk G:P = 0.91 to 1.64). Although cancer deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group (p = 0.11), cancers (excluding basal cell carcinoma) were diagnosed with equal frequency in both study groups. Due to the limited size of the study, the relative risk of death from any cause was not shown to be different than that seen in the 9 year follow-up data from World Health Organization study (RR=1.29). A secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study enrolled middle-aged men excluded from the primary prevention study because of known or suspected coronary heart disease. Subjects received gemfibrozil or placebo for 5 years. Although cardiac deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group, this was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.94 to 5.05). The rate of gallbladder surgery was not statistically significant between study groups, but did trend higher in the gemfibrozil group, (1.9% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.07). 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Serious drug-induced liver injury (DILI), including liver transplantation and death, have been reported post-marketing with fenofibrate. DILI has been reported within the first few weeks of treatment or after several months of therapy and in some cases has reversed with discontinuation of fenofibrate treatment. Patients with DILI have experienced signs and symptoms including dark urine, abnormal stool, jaundice, malaise, abdominal pain, myalgia, weight loss, pruritus, and nausea. Many patients had concurrent elevations of total bilirubin, serum alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). DILI has been characterized as hepatocellular, chronic active, and cholestatic hepatitis, and cirrhosis has occurred in association with chronic active hepatitis. In clinical trials, fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 107 mg to 160 mg fenofibrate daily has been associated with increases in serum AST or ALT. The incidence of increases in transaminases may be dose related [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Fenofibrate is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities [see Monitor patient’s liver function including serum ALT, AST and total bilirubin, at baseline and periodically for the duration of therapy with fenofibrate. Discontinue fenofibrate if signs or symptoms of liver injury develop or if elevated enzyme levels persist (ALT or AST > 3 times the upper limit of normal, or if accompanied by elevation of bilirubin). Do not restart fenofibrate in these patients if there is no alternative explanation for the liver injury. Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Fibrates increase the risk for myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal insufficiency, or hypothyroidism. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. CPK levels should be assessed in patients reporting these symptoms, and fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy/myositis is suspected or diagnosed. Data from observational studies indicate that the risk for rhabdomyolysis is increased when fibrates, in particular gemfibrozil, are co-administered with a statin. The combination should be avoided unless the benefit of further alterations in lipid levels is likely to outweigh the increased risk of this drug combination [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing fenofibrate with colchicine [see . Drug Interactions (7.4) ] 5.4 Serum Creatinine Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment taking fenofibrate. Renal monitoring should also be considered for patients taking fenofibrate at risk for renal insufficiency such as the elderly and patients with diabetes. 5.5 Cholelithiasis Fenofibrate, like clofibrate and gemfibrozil, may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. Fenofibrate therapy should be discontinued if gallstones are found. 5.6 Coumarin Anticoagulants Caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with fenofibrate because of the potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effects in prolonging the Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR). To prevent bleeding complications, frequent monitoring of PT/INR and dose adjustment of the anticoagulant are recommended until PT/INR has stabilized [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.7 Pancreatitis Pancreatitis has been reported in patients taking fenofibrate, gemfibrozil and clofibrate. This occurrence may represent a failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct. 5.8 Hematologic Changes Mild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following initiation of fenofibrate therapy. However, these levels stabilize during long-term administration. Thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported in individuals treated with fenofibrate. Periodic monitoring of red and white blood cell counts are recommended during the first 12 months of fenofibrate administration. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Acute Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported post-marketing with fenofibrate. In some cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of an acute hypersensitivity reaction, advise them to seek immediate medical attention and discontinue fenofibrate. Delayed Hypersensitivity Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCAR), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), have been reported post-marketing, occurring days to weeks after initiation of fenofibrate. The cases of DRESS were associated with cutaneous reactions (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis) and a combination of eosinophilia, fever, systemic organ involvement (renal, hepatic, or respiratory). Discontinue fenofibrate and treat patients appropriately if SCAR is suspected. 5.10 Venothromboembolic Disease In the FIELD trial, pulmonary embolus (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were observed at higher rates in the fenofibrate- than the placebo-treated group. Of 9,795 patients enrolled in FIELD, there were 4,900 in the placebo group and 4,895 in the fenofibrate group. For DVT, there were 48 events (1%) in the placebo group and 67 (1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.074); and for PE, there were 32 (0.7%) events in the placebo group and 53 (1%) in the fenofibrate group (p = 0.022). In the Coronary Drug Project, a higher proportion of the clofibrate group experienced definite or suspected fatal or nonfatal pulmonary embolism or thrombophlebitis than the placebo group (5.2% vs. 3.3% at five years; p < 0.01). 5.11 Paradoxical Decreases in HDL Cholesterol Levels There have been post-marketing and clinical trial reports of severe decreases in HDL cholesterol levels (as low as 2 mg/dL) occurring in diabetic and non-diabetic patients initiated on fibrate therapy. The decrease in HDL-C is mirrored by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1. This decrease has been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy. The HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is rapid and sustained. The clinical significance of this decrease in HDL-C is unknown. It is recommended that HDL-C levels be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy. If a severely depressed HDL-C level is detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn, and the HDL-C level monitored until it has returned to baseline, and fibrate therapy should not be re-initiated.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Mortality and coronary heart disease morbidity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Venothromboembolic disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Adverse reactions > 2% and at least 1% greater than placebo: Abnormal liver tests, increased AST, increased ALT, increased CPK, and rhinitis.

Adverse events reported by 2% or more of patients treated with fenofibrate (and greater than placebo) during the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, regardless of causality, are listed in Table 1 below. Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 5% of patients treated with fenofibrate and in 3% treated with placebo. Increases in liver function tests were the most frequent events, causing discontinuation of fenofibrate treatment in 1.6% of patients in double-blind trials. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported by 2% or More of Patients Treated with Fenofibrate and Greater than Placebo During the Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials BODY SYSTEM Adverse Reaction Fenofibrate * (N=439) Placebo (N=365) BODY AS A WHOLE Abdominal Pain 4.6% 4.4% Back Pain 3.4% 2.5% Headache 3.2% 2.7% DIGESTIVE Nausea 2.3% 1.9% Constipation 2.1% 1.4% METABOLIC AND NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS Abnormal Liver Function Tests 7.5% ** 1.4% Increased ALT 3% 1.6% Increased CPK 3% 1.4% Increased AST 3.4% ** 0.5% RESPIRATORY Respiratory Disorder 6.2% 5.5% Rhinitis 2.3% 1.1% * Dosage equivalent to 160 mg fenofibrate. ** Significantly different from Placebo. Urticaria was seen in 1.1% vs. 0%, and rash in 1.4% vs. 0.8% of fenofibrate and placebo patients respectively in controlled trials. Increases in Liver Enzymes In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal in ALT occurred in 5.3% of patients taking fenofibrate at doses equivalent to 107 mg to 160 mg fenofibrate daily versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo. In an 8-week study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 107 mg to 160 mg fenofibrate daily and was 0% in those receiving dosages equivalent to 54 mg or less fenofibrate daily or placebo. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fenofibrate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: myalgia, rhabdomyolysis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, muscle spasm, hepatitis, cirrhosis, increased total bilirubin, anemia, arthralgia, decreases in hemoglobin, decreases in hematocrit, white blood cell decreases, asthenia, severely depressed HDL-cholesterol levels and interstitial lung disease. Photosensitivity reactions have occurred days to months after initiation; in some of these cases, patients reported a prior photosensitivity reaction to ketoprofen."
