    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions ( 5.1 ) o Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis and hepatotoxicity, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions and solid organ transplant rejection. o Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. o Withhold or permanently discontinue penpulimab-kcqx based on severity and type of reaction. Infusion-Related Reactions: Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue penpulimab-kcqx based on the severity of the reaction. ( 5.2 ) Complications of Allogeneic HSCT: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Penpulimab-kcqx is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD- L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue penpulimab-kcqx depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . In general, if penpulimab-kcqx requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month [ see Dosage and A dministration (2) ] . Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis Penpulimab-kcqx can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received penpulimab-kcqx in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin and gemcitabine or single-agent penpulimab-kcqx or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis. Nervous system: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy, nerve injury. Ocular: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment including blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic. : Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism. Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Penpulimab-kcqx can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. Discontinue penpulimab-kcqx in patients with severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion-related reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Penpulimab-kcqx in Combination with Either Cisplatin or Carboplatin and Gemcitabine Infusion-related reactions occurred in 3.4% of 146 patients receiving penpulimab-kcqx in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin and gemcitabine, including Grade 2 (1.4%) and Grade 1 (2.1%) infusion related reactions. Penpulimab-kcqx as a Single Agent Infusion-related reactions occurred in 10% of 372 patients receiving penpulimab-kcqx as single agent, including Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.3%), Grade 2 (6%) and Grade 1 (3.8%) infusion related reactions. Penpulimab-kcqx was withheld in 0.8% (3/372) and permanently discontinued in 0.3% (1/372) of patients. 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and Allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an Allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, penpulimab-kcqx can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with penpulimab-kcqx and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ].",

Recurrent Metastatic Non-Keratinizing Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Study AK105-202 The safety of penpulimab-kcqx as a single agent was evaluated in Study AK105-202 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Eligible patients had metastatic non-keratinizing NPC and had received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other line of therapy or had disease progression within 6 months of completion of platinum-based chemotherapy administered as neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or definitive chemoradiation treatment. Patients received penpulimab-kcqx 200 mg intravenously every 2 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or a maximum of 24 months. Among patients who received penpulimab-kcqx, 45% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 30% for exposed for greater than one year. The median age of patients who received penpulimab-kcqx was 50 years (20 to 66 years); 76% were male; 100% were Asian, 100% had recurrent disease; baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score was 0 (31%) or 1 (69%). All patients had received at least one prior systemic therapy and prior radiation. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 22% of patients. Serious adverse reactions in ≥1% were pneumonia (3.8%), pneumonitis (1.5%), respiratory failure (1.5%), rash (1.5%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1% of patients treated with penpulimab-kcqx, including a case each of pneumonitis, septic shock, colitis, and hepatitis. Permanent discontinuation of penpulimab-kcqx due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.8% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of penpulimab-kcqx in ≥1% were rash, hepatitis, herpes zoster, spinal cord compression and pleural effusion (0.8% each). Dose interruptions of penpulimab-kcqx due to an adverse reaction occurred in 25% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose interruption in ≥ 1% of patients included hepatitis (6.2%), anemia (3.1%), pneumonia (3.1%), hypothyroidism (3.1%), rash (1.5%) and white blood cells decreased (1.5%).
