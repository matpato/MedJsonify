    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions reported (greater than 2%) were post-oocyte retrieval pain, abdominal pain, nausea, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. ( 6 ) This leaflet summarizes the most important information about ENDOMETRIN. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-FERRING (1-888-337-7464) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data reflect exposure to ENDOMETRIN in 808 infertile women (74.9% White, 10.3% Hispanic, 5.4% Black, 5% Asian, and 4.6% Other) in a single Assisted Reproductive Technology 10 week clinical study conducted in the U.S. ENDOMETRIN was studied at doses of 100 mg twice daily and 100 mg three times daily. The adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than or equal to 2% in either ENDOMETRIN group are summarized in Table 1. Table 1: Number and Frequency of Reported Adverse Reactions in Women Treated with ENDOMETRIN in an Assisted Reproductive Technology Study Body System ENDOMETRIN 100 mg twice daily (N=404) ENDOMETRIN 100 mg three times daily (N=404) Preferred Term Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain 50 (12%) 50 (12%) Nausea 32 (8%) 29 (7%) Abdominal distension 18 (4%) 17 (4%) Constipation 9 (2%) 14 (3%) Vomiting 13 (3%) 9 (2%) General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 7 (2%) 12 (3%) Infections and Infestations Urinary tract infection 9 (2%) 4 (1%) Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications Post-oocyte retrieval pain 115 (28%) 102 (25%) Nervous System Disorders Headache 15 (4%) 13 (3%) Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 30 (7%) 27 (7%) Uterine spasm 15 (4%) 11 (3%) Vaginal bleeding 13 (3%) 14 (3%) Other less common reported adverse reactions included vaginal irritation, itching, burning, discomfort, urticaria, and peripheral edema. 6.2\tExpected Adverse Reaction Profile Seen with Progesterone ENDOMETRIN is also expected to have adverse reactions similar to other drugs containing progesterone that may include breast tenderness, bloating, mood swings, irritability, and drowsiness."
