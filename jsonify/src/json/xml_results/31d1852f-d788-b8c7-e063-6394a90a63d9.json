    "indications": "1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE ADZENYS XR-ODT is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 years and older [see ]. Clinical Studies (14) ADZENYS XR-ODT is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients 6 years and older. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4. CONTRAINDICATIONS ADZENYS XR-ODT is contraindicated: In patients known to be hypersensitive to amphetamine, or other components of ADZENYS XR-ODT. Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with other amphetamine products [see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.2) Patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs (including MAOIs such a linezolid or intravenous methylene blue), because of an increased risk of hypertensive crisis [see , Warnings and Precautions (5.7) Drug Interactions 7.1 ]. Known hypersensitivity to amphetamine products or other ingredients in ADZENYS XR-ODT. ( 4 ) Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or within 14 days of the last MAOI dose. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease: Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Monitor blood pressure and pulse. ( 5.3 ) Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: Prior to initiating ADZENYS XR-ODT, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. If new psychotic or manic symptoms occur, consider discontinuing ADZENYS XR-ODT. ( 5.4 ) Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediactric Patients: Closely monitor growth (height and weight) in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. ( 5.5 ) Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon: Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during ADZENYS XR-ODT treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g. rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans), but also during overdosage situations. If it occurs, discontinue ADZENYS XR-ODT and initiate supportive treatment. ( 5.7 , 17 ) Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette’s Syndrome: Before initiating ADZENYS XR-ODT, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Regularly monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate. (5.8) 5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction ADZENYS XR-ODT has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of ADZENYS XR-ODT exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. ADZENYS XR-ODT can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including ADZENYS XR-ODT, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. Before prescribing ADZENYS XR-ODT, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store ADZENYS XR-ODT in a safe place, preferably  locked, and instruct patients to not give  ADZENYS XR-ODT to anyone else. Throughout ADZENYS XR-ODT treatment, reassess each patient’s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. 5.2 Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid ADZENYS XR-ODT use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. 5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2 to 4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3 to 6 bpm). Some patients may have larger increases. Monitor all ADZENYS XR-ODT-treated patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension. 5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation Pre-existing Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients. Prior to initiating ADZENYS XR-ODT treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or has a history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression). New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosages, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in patients without prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, conisder discontinuing ADZENYS XR-ODT. 5.5 Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in ADZENYS XR-ODT-treated pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants. Pediatric patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. 5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon CNS stimulants, including ADZENYS XR-ODT, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports and at the therapeutic dosage of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or discontinuation of the CNS stimulants. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during ADZENYS XR-ODT-treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g.,  rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for ADZENYS XRODT-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. 5.7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort [see The co-administration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to ADZENYS XR-ODT. In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Concomitant use of ADZENYS XR-ODT with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. Discontinue treatment with ADZENYS XR-ODT and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of ADZENYS XR-ODT with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate ADZENYS XR-ODT with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome. 5.8 Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette’s Syndrome CNS stimulants, including amphetamine, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette’s syndrome has also been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Before initiating ADZENYS XR-ODT, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Regularly monitor ADZENYS XR-ODT-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette’s syndrome and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate. 5.9 Potential for Overdose Due to Medication Errors Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between ADZENYS XR-ODT and other amphetamine products could occur, leading to possible overdosage. To avoid substitution errors and overdosage, do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].",

The safety of ADZENYS XR-ODT has been established from adequate and well-controlled studies of single-entity amphetamine product extended-release (MAS ER) capsules [see ]. The adverse reactions of MAS ER capsules in these adequate and well-controlled studies are described below. Clinical Studies (14) The premarketing development program for MAS ER included exposures in a total of 1315 participants in clinical trials (635 pediatric patients, 350 adolescent patients, 248 adult patients, and 82 healthy adult subjects). Of these, 635 patients (ages 6 to 12 years) were evaluated in two controlled clinical studies, one open-label clinical study, and two single-dose clinical pharmacology studies (N= 40). Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MAS ER in controlled and uncontrolled, multiple-dose clinical trials of pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N=595) were anorexia (loss of appetite) (2.9%), insomnia (1.5%), weight loss (1.2%), emotional lability (1%), and depression (0.7%). In a separate placebo-controlled 4-week study in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years with ADHD, five patients (2.1%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among MAS ER-treated patients (N=233) compared to 0% who received placebo (N=54). The most frequent adverse event leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MAS ER-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) was insomnia (1.3%, n=3). In one placebo-controlled 4-week study among adults with ADHD with doses 20 mg to 60 mg, 23 patients (12.0% ) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among MAS ER-treated patients (N=191) compared to one patient (1.6%) who received placebo (N=64). The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MAS ER-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (5.2%, n=10), anxiety (2.1%, n=4), nervousness (1.6%, n=3), dry mouth (1.6%, n=3), anorexia (1.6%, n=3), tachycardia (1.6%, n=3), headache (1.6%, n=3), and asthenia (1.0%, n=2). Adverse Reactions Occurring in Clinical Trials Adverse reactions reported in a 3-week clinical trial of pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age and a 4-week clinical trial in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age and adults, respectively, treated with MAS ER or placebo are presented in the tables below.
