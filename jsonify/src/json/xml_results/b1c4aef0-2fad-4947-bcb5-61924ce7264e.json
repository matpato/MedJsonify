(1) Limitations of Use: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, reserve oxycodone hydrochloride for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or non-opioid combination products): Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Oxycodone hydrochloride should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Oxycodone hydrochloride are contraindicated in patients with: Significant      respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Acute or      severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of      resuscitative equipment or hypercarbia [see Warnings and Precautions      (5.8)]. Known or      suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [see      Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] . Known      hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to oxycodone [see Adverse      Reactions (6.2)]. Significant respiratory depression (4) Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in absence of resuscitative equipment (4) Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus (4) Hypersensitivity to oxycodone (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation. (5.7) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Regularly evaluate closely, particularly during initiation and titration. (5.8) Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. (5.9) Severe Hypotension : Regularly evaluate during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of oxycodone hydrochloride in patients with circulatory shock. (5.10) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of oxycodone hydrochloride in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. (5.11) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Oxycodone hydrochloride contain oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxycodone hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxycodone hydrochloride. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxycodone hydrochloride, and reassess all patients receiving oxycodone hydrochloride for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as oxycodone hydrochloride, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxycodone hydrochloride along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxycodone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and on the proper disposal of unused drugs. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)] . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxycodone hydrochloride, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxycodone hydrochloride are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2)] . Overestimating the oxycodone hydrochloride dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in fatal overdose with the first dose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of oxycodone hydrochloride, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of oxycodone. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with oxycodone hydrochloride. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3), Overdosage (10)]. 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of oxycodone hydrochloride with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions (7)] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation) If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)] . Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when oxycodone hydrochloride is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of oxycodone hydrochloride for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . 5.5 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG. Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. 5.6 Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Concomitant use of oxycodone hydrochloride with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of oxycodone hydrochloride is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in oxycodone hydrochloride -treated patients        may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using oxycodone hydrochloride with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in oxycodone hydrochloride -treated patients, evaluate patients at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of oxycodone hydrochloride until                             stable drugs effects are achieved [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Concomitant use of oxycodone hydrochloride with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease oxycodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone. When using oxycodone hydrochloride with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, evaluate patients at             frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase             in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for    increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)] . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . 5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of oxycodone hydrochloride in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Oxycodone hydrochloride -treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of oxycodone hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating oxycodone hydrochloride and when oxycodone hydrochloride is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Drug Interactions (7)] . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs      including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal  insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal         insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until  adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Oxycodone hydrochloride may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of oxycodone hydrochloride. In patients with circulatory shock, use of oxycodone hydrochloride may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid use of oxycodone hydrochloride in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence  of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), oxycodone hydrochloride may reduce the respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxycodone hydrochloride. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Oxycodone hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The oxycodone in oxycodone hydrochloride may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The oxycodone in oxycodone hydrochloride may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during oxycodone hydrochloride therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue oxycodone hydrochloride in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing oxycodone hydrochloride in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of oxycodone in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] . Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including oxycodone hydrochloride. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Oxycodone hydrochloride may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oxycodone hydrochloride and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] .",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Opioid-Induce Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] Most common adverse reactions (≥3%) were nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, pruritus, insomnia, dizziness, asthenia, and somnolence. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Strides Pharma Inc at 1-877-244-9825 and www.strides.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Oxycodone hydrochloride have been evaluated in open label clinical trials in patients with cancer and nonmalignant pain. Oxycodone hydrochloride are associated with adverse experiences similar to those seen with other opioids. Serious adverse reactions associated with oxycodone hydrochloride use included: respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, cardiac arrest, hypotension, and/or shock. The common adverse reactions seen on initiation of therapy with oxycodone hydrochloride are dose related and are typical opioid-related adverse reactions. The most frequent of these included nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, pruritus, insomnia, dizziness, asthenia, and somnolence. The frequency of these reactions depended on several factors, including clinical setting, the patient's level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual. In all patients for whom dosing information was available (n=191) from the open-label and double-blind studies involving oxycodone hydrochloride, the following adverse events were recorded in oxycodone hydrochloride treated patients with an incidence ≥ 3%. In descending order of frequency they were: nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, pruritus, insomnia, dizziness, asthenia, and somnolence. Other less frequently observed adverse reactions from opioid analgesics, including oxycodone hydrochloride included: Blood and lymphatic system disorders : anemia, leukopenia Cardiac disorders : cardiac failure, palpitation, tachycardia Gastrointestinal disorders : abdominal pain, dry mouth, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dysphagia, glossitis, nausea, vomiting. General disorders and administration site conditions : chills, edema, edema peripheral, pain, pyrexia Immune system disorders : hypersensitivity Infections and infestations : bronchitis, gingivitis, infection, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sepsis, sinusitis, urinary tract infection Injury, poisoning and procedural complications : injury Metabolism and nutrition disorders : decreased appetite, gout, hyperglycemia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : arthralgia, arthritis, back pain, bone pain, myalgia, neck pain, pathological fracture Nervous system disorders : hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, neuralgia, tremor, vasodilation Psychiatric disorders : agitation, anxiety, confusional state, nervousness, personality disorder Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, laryngospasm, lung disorder Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : photosensitivity reaction, rash, hyperhidrosis, urticaria Vascular disorders : thrombophlebitis, hemorrhage, hypotension, vasodilatation 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oxycodone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General disorders and administrative site disorders : drug withdrawal syndrome neonatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : pharyngeal edema Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9 )]. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylactic reaction has been reported with ingredients contained in oxycodone hydrochloride [see Contraindications (4)]. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )]. Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids . Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes)."
