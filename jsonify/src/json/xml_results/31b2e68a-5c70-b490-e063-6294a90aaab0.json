    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pemetrexed for injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelosuppression: Can cause severe bone marrow suppression resulting in cytopenia and an increased risk of infection. Do not administer pemetrexed for injection when the absolute neutrophil count is less than 1500 cells/mm 3 and platelets are less than 100,000 cells/mm 3 . Initiate supplementation with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B 12 to reduce the severity of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed for injection. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) • Renal Failure: Can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal failure. Do not administer when creatinine clearance is less than 45 mL/min. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) • Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity: Permanently discontinue for severe and life-threatening bullous, blistering or exfoliating skin toxicity. ( 5.3 ) • Interstitial Pneumonitis: Withhold for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms. Permanently discontinue if pneumonitis is confirmed. ( 5.4 ) • Radiation Recall: Can occur in patients who received radiation weeks to years previously; permanently discontinue for signs of radiation recall. ( 5.5 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression without Vitamin Supplementation Pemetrexed can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection. The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation. In Study JMCH, incidences of Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (38% versus 23%), thrombocytopenia (9% versus 5%), febrile neutropenia (9% versus 0.6%), and neutropenic infection (6% versus 0) were higher in patients who received pemetrexed for injection plus cisplatin without vitamin supplementation as compared to patients who were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B 12 prior to and throughout pemetrexed for injection plus cisplatin treatment. Initiate supplementation with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B 12 prior to the first dose of pemetrexed; continue vitamin supplementation during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed to reduce the severity of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed [see Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle. Do not administer pemetrexed for injection until the ANC is at least 1500 cells/mm Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 3 and platelet count is at least 100,000 cells/mm 3 . Permanently reduce pemetrexed for injection in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells/mm 3 or platelet count of less than 50,000 cells/mm 3 in previous cycles [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. In Studies JMDB and JMCH, among patients who received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was 15% and 23%, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 anemia was 6% and 4%, and incidence of Grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia was 4% and 5%, respectively. In Study JMCH, 18% of patients in the pemetrexed arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7% of patients in the cisplatin arm [see In Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI, where all patients received vitamin supplementation, incidence of Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia ranged from 3% to 5%, and incidence of Grade 3 to 4 anemia ranged from 3% to 5%. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.2 Renal Failure Pemetrexed for injection can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, renal toxicity. The incidences of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received pemetrexed with cisplatin were: 2.1% in Study JMDB and 2.2% in Study JMCH. The incidence of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received pemetrexed as a single agent ranged from 0.4% to 0.6% (Studies JMEN, PARAMOUNT, and JMEI [see Determine creatinine clearance before each dose and periodically monitor renal function during treatment with pemetrexed. Withhold pemetrexed in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 mL/minute Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.3 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity Serious and sometimes fatal, bullous, blistering and exfoliative skin toxicity, including cases suggestive of Stevens- Johnson Syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur with pemetrexed. Permanently discontinue pemetrexed for severe and life-threatening bullous, blistering or exfoliating skin toxicity. 5.4 Interstitial Pneumonitis Serious interstitial pneumonitis, including fatal cases, can occur with pemetrexed for injection treatment. Withhold pemetrexed for injection for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, or fever pending diagnostic evaluation. If pneumonitis is confirmed, permanently discontinue pemetrexed. 5.5 Radiation Recall Radiation recall can occur with pemetrexed in patients who have received radiation weeks to years previously. Monitor patients for inflammation or blistering in areas of previous radiation treatment. Permanently discontinue pemetrexed for signs of radiation recall. 5.6 Increased Risk of Toxicity with Ibuprofen in Patients with Renal Impairment Exposure to pemetrexed is increased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment who take concomitant ibuprofen, increasing the risks of adverse reactions of pemetrexed. In patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of pemetrexed. If concomitant ibuprofen use cannot be avoided, monitor patients more frequently for pemetrexed adverse reactions, including myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, pemetrexed can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic, resulting in developmental delays and increased malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg/m 2 . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ].",

In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) of pemetrexed, when administered as a single agent, are fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) of pemetrexed, when administered in combination with cisplatin are vomiting, neutropenia, anemia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, and constipation. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) of pemetrexed, when administered in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy, are fatigue/asthenia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, and pyrexia. Non-Squamous NSCLC First-line Treatment of Metastatic Non-squamous NSCLC with Pembrolizumab and Platinum Chemotherapy The safety of pemetrexed, in combination with pembrolizumab and investigator’s choice of platinum (either carboplatin or cisplatin), was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-189, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized (2:1), active-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. A total of 607 patients received pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pemetrexed and pembrolizumab (n=405), or placebo, pemetrexed, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed (n=202). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The median duration of exposure to pemetrexed was 7.2 months (range: 1 day to 1.7 years). Seventy-two percent of patients received carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 years or older, 59% male, 94% White and 3% Asian, and 18% with history of brain metastases at baseline. Pemetrexed was discontinued for adverse reactions in 23% of patients in the pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and platinum arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of pemetrexed in this arm were acute kidney injury (3%) and pneumonitis (2%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of pemetrexed occurred in 49% of patients in the pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and platinum arm. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of pemetrexed in this arm (≥2%) were neutropenia (12%), anemia (7%), asthenia (4%), pneumonia (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), diarrhea (3%), and fatigue (3%). Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥20% of patients treated with pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, and platinum.

Initial Treatment in Combination with Cisplatin The safety of pemetrexed was evaluated in Study JMDB, a randomized (1:1), open-label, multicenter trial conducted in chemotherapy-naive patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Patients received either pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 intravenously and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (n=839) or gemcitabine 1250 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (n=830). All patients were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B 12 . Study JMDB excluded patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS of 2 or greater), uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B 12 or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study. The data described below reflect exposure to pemetrexed plus cisplatin in 839 patients in Study JMDB. Median age was 61 years (range 26 to 83 years); 70% of patients were men; 78% were White, 16% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, 2.1% were Black or African American, and <1% were other ethnicities; 36% had an ECOG PS 0. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of pemetrexed. Table 4 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions that occurred in ≥5% of 839 patients receiving pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin in Study JMDB. Study JMDB was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for pemetrexed, as compared to the control arm, for any specified adverse reaction listed in Table 4.

Patients received either pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 or matching placebo intravenously every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in both study arms were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B 12 . Study JMEN excluded patients with an ECOG PS of 2 or greater, uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B 12 or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study. The data described below reflect exposure to pemetrexed in 438 patients in Study JMEN. Median age was 61 years (range 26 to 83 years), 73% of patients were men; 65% were White, 31% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, and <2% were other ethnicities; 39% had an ECOG PS 0. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of pemetrexed and a relative dose intensity of pemetrexed of 96%. Approximately half the patients (48%) completed at least six, 21-day cycles and 23% completed ten or more 21-day cycles of pemetrexed.

Patients received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety was assessed in 226 patients who received at least one dose of pemetrexed f in combination with cisplatin and 222 patients who received at   least one dose of cisplatin alone. Among 226 patients who received pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin, 74% (n=168) received full supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 during study therapy, 14% (n=32) were never supplemented, and 12% (n=26) were partially supplemented. Study JMCH excluded patients with Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of less than 70, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were also excluded from the study. The data described below reflect exposure to pemetrexed in 168 patients that were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B12. Median age was 60 years (range 19 to 85 years); 82% were men; 92% were White, 5% were Hispanic or Latino, 3.0% were Asian, and <1% were other ethnicities; 54% had KPS of 90-100. The median number of treatment cycles administered was 6 in the pemetrexed/cisplatin fully supplemented group and 2 in the pemetrexed/cisplatin never supplemented group. Patients receiving pemetrexed in the fully supplemented group had a relative dose intensity of 93% of the protocol-specified pemetrexed dose intensity. The most common adverse reaction resulting in dose delay was neutropenia. Table 8 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions ≥5% in the subgroup of pemetrexed-treated patients who were fully vitamin supplemented in Study JMCH. Study JMCH was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for pemetrexed as compared to the control arm, for any specified adverse reaction listed in the table below.

Table 8 provides the ADRs for subgroup of patients treated with pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin (168 patients) or cisplatin alone (163 patients) who received full supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12 during study therapy. b   NCI CTCAE version 2.0. The following additional adverse reactions were observed in patients receiving pemetrexed plus cisplatin: Incidence 1% to <5% Body as a Whole — febrile neutropenia, infection, pyrexia Dermatology/Skin — urticaria General Disorders — chest pain Metabolism and Nutrition — increased AST, increased ALT, increased GGT Renal — renal failure Incidence <1% Cardio vascular — arrhythmia Neurology — motor neuropathy Exploratory Subgroup Analyses based on Vitamin Supplementation Table 9 provides the results of exploratory analyses of the frequency and severity of NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions reported in more pemetrexed-treated patients who did not receive vitamin supplementation (never supplemented) as compared with those who received vitamin supplementation with daily folic acid and vitamin B12 from the time of enrollment in Study JMCH (fully-supplemented).

The following adverse reactions occurred more frequently in patients who were fully vitamin supplemented than in patients who were never supplemented: • hypertension (11% versus 3%), • chest pain (8% versus 6%), • thrombosis/embolism (6% versus 3%). Additional Experience Across Clinical Trials Sepsis, with or without neutropenia, including fatal cases : 1% Severe esophagitis, resulting in hospitalization : <1% 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pemetrexed. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System — immune-mediated hemolytic anemia Gastrointestinal — colitis, pancreatitis General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions — edema Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications — radiation recall Respiratory — interstitial pneumonitis Skin — Serious and fatal bullous skin conditions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis"
