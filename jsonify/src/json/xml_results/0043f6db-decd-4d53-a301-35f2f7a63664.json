    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE CIBINQO is indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with refractory, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when use of those therapies is inadvisable. CIBINQO is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with refractory, moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products, including biologics, or when use of those therapies is inadvisable. ( 1 ) Limitation of Use : CIBINQO is not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic immunomodulators, or with other immunosuppressants. Limitations of Use CIBINQO is not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic immunomodulators, or other immunosuppressants.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS CIBINQO is contraindicated in patients taking antiplatelet therapies, except for low-dose aspirin (≤81 mg daily), during the first 3 months of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Drug Interactions (7.2) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. Antiplatelet therapies except for low-dose aspirin (≤81 mg daily), during the first 3 months of treatment. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Laboratory Abnormalities : Laboratory monitoring is recommended due to potential changes in platelets, lymphocytes, and lipids. ( 5.6 ) • Immunizations : Avoid use of live vaccines immediately prior to, during and immediately after CIBINQO treatment. ( 5.7 ) 5.1\tSerious Infections The most frequent serious infections reported in clinical studies with CIBINQO for atopic dermatitis were herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and pneumonia [see . Serious infections leading to hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis and bacterial, invasive fungal, viral, and other opportunistic infections, have occurred in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Avoid use of CIBINQO in patients with active, serious infection including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating CIBINQO in patients: • with chronic or recurrent infection • who have been exposed to tuberculosis • with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection • who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses • with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with CIBINQO. If a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection, discontinue CIBINQO. Initiate complete diagnostic testing and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The risks and benefits of treatment with CIBINQO should be carefully considered prior to reinitiating therapy with CIBINQO. Tuberculosis Evaluate and test patients for TB before starting CIBINQO therapy and consider yearly screening for patients in highly endemic areas for TB. CIBINQO is not recommended for use in patients with active TB. For patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or prior untreated latent TB, or for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who are at high risk for TB infection, start preventive therapy for latent TB prior to initiation of CIBINQO. Monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients who were tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy. Viral Reactivation Viral reactivation, including herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster, herpes simplex), was reported in clinical trials with CIBINQO [see . If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting CIBINQO until the episode resolves. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors. Perform viral hepatitis screening in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy and monitor for reactivation during therapy with CIBINQO. CIBINQO is not recommended for use in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C [see . Monitor patients with inactive HBV for expression of HBV DNA during therapy with CIBINQO. If HBV DNA is detected during therapy with CIBINQO, consult a liver specialist. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.2\tMortality In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of another JAK inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in subjects treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with CIBINQO. 5.3\tMalignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders Malignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), were observed in clinical trials with CIBINQO for atopic dermatitis [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Perform periodic skin examination for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using broad-spectrum sunscreen. Malignancies, including lymphomas, have occurred in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of another JAK inhibitor in RA subjects, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed in subjects treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in subjects treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. In this trial, current or past smokers had an additional increased risk of overall malignancies. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with CIBINQO, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy when on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers. 5.4\tMajor Adverse Cardiovascular Events Major adverse cardiovascular events were reported in clinical trials of CIBINQO for atopic dermatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of another JAK inhibitor in RA subjects 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke was observed with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with CIBINQO, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue CIBINQO in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke. 5.5\tThrombosis Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were observed in subjects receiving CIBINQO in the clinical trials for atopic dermatitis [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Thrombosis, including DVT, PE, and arterial thrombosis have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these adverse reactions were serious and some resulted in death. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety trial of another JAK inhibitor in RA subjects 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers. CIBINQO is not approved for use in RA. Avoid CIBINQO in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If symptoms of thrombosis occur, discontinue CIBINQO and evaluate and treat patients appropriately. 5.6\tLaboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Abnormalities Treatment with CIBINQO was associated with an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia [see . Prior to CIBINQO initiation, perform a CBC Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . CBC evaluations are recommended at 4 weeks after initiation and 4 weeks after dose increase of CIBINQO. Discontinuation of CIBINQO therapy is required for certain laboratory abnormalities Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Lipid Elevations Dose-dependent increase in blood lipid parameters were reported in subjects treated with CIBINQO [see . Lipid parameters should be assessed approximately 4 weeks following initiation of CIBINQO therapy and thereafter patients should be managed according to clinical guidelines for hyperlipidemia. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.7\tImmunizations Prior to initiating CIBINQO, complete all age-appropriate vaccinations as recommended by current immunization guidelines, including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccinations. Avoid vaccination with live vaccines immediately prior to, during and immediately after CIBINQO therapy.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Mortality [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Laboratory Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse events (≥1% with CIBINQO 100 mg) are nasopharyngitis, nausea, headache, herpes simplex, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, dizziness, urinary tract infection, fatigue, acne, vomiting, impetigo, oropharyngeal pain, hypertension, influenza, gastroenteritis, and dermatitis contact. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (≥1% with CIBINQO 200 mg and greater than CIBINQO 100 mg) are nausea, headache, herpes simplex, increased blood creatine kinase, dizziness, urinary tract infection, acne, vomiting, gastroenteritis, upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, herpes zoster, and thrombocytopenia.

The safety of CIBINQO was evaluated in four randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (2 monotherapy, 1 combination therapy with topical corticosteroid, and 1 dose-ranging) and one long-term extension trial in subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD). A total of 1623 subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were treated with CIBINQO in these clinical trials representing 1428 patient-years of exposure. There were 634 subjects with at least 1 year of exposure to CIBINQO. In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, a total of 1198 subjects were exposed to CIBINQO with 608 subjects receiving CIBINQO 100 mg once daily and 590 subjects receiving CIBINQO 200 mg once daily for up to 16 weeks. The median age of subjects was 33.0 years, 124 subjects (8.1%) were 12 to less than 18 years old and 94 subjects (6.1%) were 65 years of age or older. The majority of subjects were White (68.7%) and male (53.9%). Adverse reactions occurring at ≥1% in any of the treated groups and at a higher rate than in the placebo group are presented in Table 3. A total of 61 (5.1%) subjects treated with CIBINQO were discontinued from the trials due to adverse reactions. The safety profile of CIBINQO in the monotherapy and the combination trial(s) were similar. Table 3.

Overall Infections In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, overall infections were reported in 90 subjects (126.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 211 subjects (168.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 204 subjects (159.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, overall infections were reported in 427 subjects (91.8 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 394 subjects (103.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Serious Infections In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, serious infections were reported in 2 subjects (2.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 6 subjects (3.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg, and 2 subjects (1.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, serious infections were reported in 18 subjects (2.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 16 subjects (2.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. The most commonly reported serious infections were herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and pneumonia. Herpes Zoster In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, opportunistic infections were generally cases of multidermatomal cutaneous herpes zoster. Herpes zoster was reported in 0 subjects treated with placebo, 3 subjects (1.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 8 subjects (5.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, herpes zoster was reported in 16 subjects (2.0 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 35 subjects (5.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Malignancy In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, no malignancy was reported in subjects treated with placebo or CIBINQO 100 mg and in 1 patient (0.65 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, malignancy was reported in 4 subjects (0.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 2 subjects (0.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Thrombosis In all clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, pulmonary embolism was reported in 3 subjects (0.4 per 100 patient-years), who were treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Deep vein thrombosis was reported in 2 subjects (0.3 per 100 patient-years) who were treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. No thrombosis occurred in subjects treated with CIBINQO 100 mg. Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was reported in 1 subject (0.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, MACE was reported in 1 patient (0.1 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg and 2 subjects (0.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg. Thrombocytopenia In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, treatment with CIBINQO was associated with a dose-related decrease in platelet count. Maximum effects on platelets were observed within 4 weeks, after which the platelet count returned towards baseline despite continued therapy. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, 6 subjects (0.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg had adverse reactions of thrombocytopenia; no subjects treated with CIBINQO 100 mg had an adverse reaction of thrombocytopenia. Lymphopenia In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, confirmed ALC <500/mm 3 occurred in 2 subjects (1.2 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 200 mg and 0 subjects treated with CIBINQO 100 mg or placebo. Both cases occurred in the first 4 weeks of exposure. Lipid Elevations In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, there was a dose-related percent increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) relative to placebo at Week 4 which remained elevated through the final visit in the treatment period. Adverse reactions related to hyperlipidemia occurred in 1 subject (0.6 per 100 patient-years) exposed to CIBINQO 100 mg, 3 subjects (2.0 per 100 patient-years) exposed to CIBINQO 200 mg. Retinal Detachment In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, retinal detachment occurred in 1 subject (0.6 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg. In all 5 clinical trials, including the long-term extension trial, retinal detachment occurred in 2 subjects (0.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with CIBINQO 100 mg. Creatine Phosphokinase Elevations (CPK) In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 16 weeks, events of blood CPK increased were reported in 6 subjects (7.5 per 100 patient-years) treated with placebo, 11 subjects (6.9 per 100 patient-years) treated with 100 mg of CIBINQO and 19 subjects (12.3 per 100 patient-years) treated with 200 mg of CIBINQO. Most elevations were transient, there were no reported adverse reactions of rhabdomyolysis. Pediatric Subjects (12 to less than 18 years of age) The safety of CIBINQO was assessed in a trial of 284 subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (Trial-AD-4). The safety profile of CIBINQO in these subjects, assessed through the initial treatment period of 12 weeks and the long-term period (213 with at least 52 weeks of abrocitinib exposure), was comparable to the safety profile from trials in adults with atopic dermatitis."
