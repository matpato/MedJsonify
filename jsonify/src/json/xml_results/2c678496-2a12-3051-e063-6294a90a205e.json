    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Visual Impairment: Monitor and evaluate for visual impairment throughout treatment. Withhold LYMPHIR until visual impairment resolves or permanently discontinue based on severity. ( 5.2 ) Infusion-Related Reactions: Monitor patients closely during infusions. Interrupt or discontinue for infusion-related reactions based on severity. ( 5.3 ) Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.5 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Capillary Leak Syndrome LYMPHIR can cause capillary leak syndrome (CLS), including life-threatening or fatal reactions. CLS was defined in the clinical trials as the occurrence of at least 2 of the following symptoms at any time during LYMPHIR therapy: hypotension, edema, and serum albumin <3 g/dL. These symptoms were not required to occur simultaneously to be characterized as capillary leak syndrome. As defined, CLS occurred in 27% of patients in the pooled population across 3 clinical trials, including 8% with Grade 3. There was one (0.8%) fatal occurrence of CLS. Of the patients with CLS, 22% had recurrence. The majority of CLS events (81%) occurred within the first 2 cycles of treatment. The median time to onset from Cycle 1, Day 1 was 6.5 days (range: 1 to 77), the median duration of CLS was 14 days (range: 2 to 40), and 75% of patients had resolution. The most common symptoms included edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hypotension. Pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and dehydration also occurred. Regularly assess patients for weight gain, new onset or worsening of edema, dyspnea, and hypotension (including orthostatic changes). Monitor serum albumin levels prior to the initiation of each cycle of therapy and more often as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity. If LYMPHIR is withheld, resume LYMPHIR following resolution of CLS and when serum albumin is greater than or equal to 3 g/dL [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 and 2.4 )] 5.2 Visual Impairment LYMPHIR can cause serious visual impairment, including changes in visual acuity and color vision. In the pooled population across 3 clinical trials, visual impairment occurred in 9%, with Grade 1 in 8% and Grade 2 in 1%. The most commonly reported symptom was blurred vision. Of the patients with visual impairment, 67% had resolution of their visual impairment. Perform baseline ophthalmic examination and monitor as clinically indicated. If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment, such as changes in visual acuity, changes in color vision, or blurred vision, refer for ophthalmologic evaluation. Withhold LYMPHIR until visual impairment resolves or permanently discontinue based on severity . [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] 5. 3 Infusion-Related Reactions LYMPHIR can cause serious infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions were reported in 69% of patients in the pooled population across 3 clinical trials of patients who received LYMPHIR, with Grade 3 infusion-related reactions in 3.4% [see Adverse Reactions ( . Eighty-three percent of infusion-related reactions occurred in Cycles 1 and 2. The most common symptoms included nausea, fatigue, chills, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, fever, and arthralgia. 6.1 )] Premedicate patients for the first three cycles prior to starting a LYMPHIR infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( . Monitor patients frequently during infusion. For Grade 2 or higher infusion reactions, premedicate at least 30 minutes prior to each subsequent infusion with a systemic steroid for at least 3 cycles 2.3 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 )] Interrupt or discontinue LYMPHIR based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( Institute appropriate medical management. 2.4 )]. 5. 4 Hepatotoxicity LYMPHIR can cause hepatotoxicity. In the pooled safety population, elevated ALT occurred in 70% of patients, with Grade 3 ALT occurring in 22%; elevated AST occurred in 64% of patients, with Grade 3 AST elevation occurring in 9%. For Grade 3 events, median time to onset was 8 days (range: 1 to 15 days); median time to resolution was 15 days (range: 7 to 50 days); all cases of Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations resolved [see Adverse Reactions ( Elevated total bilirubin occurred in 5% of patients, with Grade 3 occurring in 0.9%. 6.1 )]. Monitor liver enzymes and bilirubin at baseline and during treatment as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue LYMPHIR based on severity [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 )] 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, LYMPHIR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of LYMPHIR. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 days following the last dose of LYMPHIR [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.3 )]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Capillary Leak Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Visual Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] The most common adverse reactions (≥20%), including laboratory abnormalities, are increased transaminases, albumin decreased, nausea, edema, hemoglobin decreased, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, chills, constipation, pyrexia, and capillary leak syndrome. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Citius Oncology, Inc. at 1-844-459-6744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to LYMPHIR as a single agent in 119 patients with CTCL across 3 clinical trials. Patients received treatment with LYMPHIR as an intravenous infusion at 9 mcg/kg daily from Day 1 through Day 5 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among 119 patients who received LYMPHIR the median number of cycles received was 5 (range: 1 to 42), with 13% exposed for 6 months or longer. In this pooled safety population, the most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were increased transaminases (70%), albumin decreased (53%), nausea (40%), edema (35%), hemoglobin decreased (34%), fatigue (30%), musculoskeletal pain (26%), rash (23%), chills (22%), constipation (22%), pyrexia (21%), and capillary leak syndrome (20%). Relapsed or Refractory Stage I-III CTCL Study 302 The safety of LYMPHIR was evaluated in Study 302, an open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial that included 69 patients with relapsed or refractory Stage I-III CTCL [see Clinical Studies ( . Patients received treatment with LYMPHIR 9 mcg/kg daily from Day 1 through Day 5 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment was administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median number of LYMPHIR cycles was 6 (range: 1 to 42). 14 )] The median age of patients was 64 years (range: 28 to 87 years), 49% were 65 years of age or older, 65% were men, 72% were White, 19% were Black or African American, 1.4% were Asian, and 14% were Hispanic or Latino. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients who received LYMPHIR. Serious adverse reactions in > 2% of patients included capillary leak syndrome (10%), infusion-related reaction (9%), sepsis (7%), skin infection (2.9%), pyrexia (2.9%), and rash (2.9%). Permanent discontinuation of LYMPHIR due to an adverse reaction occurred in 12% of patients. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of LYMPHIR included capillary leak syndrome, infusion-related reaction, renal insufficiency, respiratory failure, and sepsis. Dosage interruptions of LYMPHIR due to an adverse reaction occurred in 38% of patients. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption of LYMPHIR included capillary leak syndrome, infusion-related reaction, weight increase, nausea, and tachycardia.
