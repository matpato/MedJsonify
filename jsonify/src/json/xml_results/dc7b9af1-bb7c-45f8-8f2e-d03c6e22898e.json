    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Doxorubicin hydrochloride is an anthracycline topoisomerase inhibitor indicated for: Ovarian cancer: After failure of platinum-based chemotherapy (1.1). AIDS-related Kaposi’s Sarcoma: After failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy (1.2). Multiple Myeloma: In combination with bortezomib in patients who have not previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy (1.3). 1.1 Ovarian Cancer Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is indicated for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer whose disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy. 1.2 AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is indicated for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in patients after failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy. 1.3 Multiple Myeloma Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, in combination with bortezomib, is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have not previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to doxorubicin hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Hypersensitivity reactions to doxorubicin hydrochloride or the components of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection ( 4 , 5.2 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hand-Foot Syndrome may occur. Dose modification or discontinuation may be required ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus. Use effective contraception ( 5.5 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy with doxorubicin hydrochloride is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. Include prior use of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of cumulative dose. The risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses in patients with prior mediastinal irradiation. In a clinical study in 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, the risk of cardiomyopathy was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450 mg/m 2 to 550 mg/m 2 . Cardiomyopathy was defined as >20% decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline where LVEF remained in the normal range or a >10% decrease in LVEF from baseline where LVEF was less than the institutional lower limit of normal. Two percent of patients developed signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure without documented evidence of cardiomyopathy. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g. MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiomyopathy. Administer doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Serious, life-threatening, and fatal infusion-related reactions characterized by one or more of the following symptoms can occur with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection: flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, chest pain, back pain, tightness in the chest and throat, fever, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, cyanosis, syncope, bronchospasm, asthma, apnea, and hypotension. Of 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in Trial 4, 7% of patients experienced acute infusion-related reactions resulting in dose interruption. All occurred during cycle 1 and none during subsequent cycles. Across multiple studies of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection monotherapy including this and other studies enrolling 760 patients with various solid tumors, 11% of patients had infusion-related reactions. The majority of infusion-related events occurred during the first infusion. Ensure that medications to treat infusion-related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment are available for immediate use prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection. Initiate doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection infusions at a rate of 1 mg/min and increase rate as tolerated [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Withhold doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for Grade 1, 2, or 3 infusion-related reactions and resume at a reduced infusion rate. Discontinue doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for serious or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. 5.3 Hand-Foot Syndrome(HFS) In Trial 4, the incidence of HFS was 51% of patients in the doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection arm and 0.9% of patients in the topotecan arm, including 24% Grade 3 or 4 cases of HFS in doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection-treated patients and no Grade 3 or 4 cases in topotecan-treated patients. HFS or other skin toxicity required discontinuation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in 4.2% of patients. HFS was generally observed after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment but may occur earlier. Delay doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for the first episode of Grade 2 or greater HFS [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Discontinue doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection if HFS is severe and debilitating. 5.4 Secondary Oral Neoplasms Secondary oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinoma, have been reported from postmarketing experience in patients with long-term (more than one year) exposure to doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection. These malignancies were diagnosed both during treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection and up to 6 years after the last dose. Examine patients at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or with any oral discomfort that may be indicative of secondary oral cancer. The altered pharmacokinetics and preferential tissue distribution of liposomal doxorubicin that contributes to enhanced skin toxicity and mucositis compared to free doxorubicin may play a role in the development of oral secondary malignancies with long-term use. 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman; avoid the use of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection during the 1 st trimester. Available human data do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects and miscarriage related to the use of doxorubicin hydrochloride during the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. At doses approximately 0.12 times the recommended clinical dose, doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].",

Patients With AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma The safety data described is based on the experience reported in 753 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) enrolled in four open-label, uncontrolled trials of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection administered at doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg/m 2 every 2 to 3 weeks. Demographics of the population were: median age 38.7 years (range 24 to 70); 99% male; 88% Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, 4% Black, and 2% Asian/other/unknown. The majority of patients were treated with 20 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection every 2 to 3 weeks with a median exposure of 4.2 months (range 1 day to 26.6 months). The median cumulative dose was 120 mg/m 2 (range 3.3 to 798.6 mg/m 2 ); 3% received cumulative doses of greater than 450 mg/m 2 . Disease characteristics were: 61% poor risk for KS tumor burden, 91% poor risk for immune system, and 47% poor risk for systemic illness; 36% were poor risk for all three categories; median CD4 count 21 cells/mm 3 (51% less than 50 cells/mm 3 ); mean absolute neutrophil count at study entry approximately 3,000 cells/mm 3 . Of the 693 patients with concomitant medication information, 59% were on one or more antiretroviral medications [35% zidovudine (AZT), 21% didanosine (ddI), 16% zalcitabine (ddC), and 10% stavudine (D4T)]; 85% received PCP prophylaxis (54% sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim); 85% received antifungal medications (76% fluconazole); 72% received antivirals (56% acyclovir, 29% ganciclovir, and 16% foscarnet) and 48% patients received colony-stimulating factors (sargramostim/filgrastim) during their course of treatment. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5% of patients with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and included myelosuppression, cardiac adverse reactions, infusion-related reactions, toxoplasmosis, HFS, pneumonia, cough/dyspnea, fatigue, optic neuritis, progression of a non-KS tumor, allergy to penicillin, and unspecified reasons. Tables 5 and 6 summarize adverse reactions reported in patients treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in a pooled analysis of the four trials.
