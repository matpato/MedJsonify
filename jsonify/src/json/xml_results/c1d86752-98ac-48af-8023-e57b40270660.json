    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (eg, on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Limitation of Use Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension. If the fixed combination represents the dose titrated to the individual patient's needs, therapy with the fixed combination may be more convenient than with the separate components. Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is the combination tablet of metoprolol tartrate, a beta adrenoceptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a thiazide diuretic, indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is contraindicated in patients with: Cardiogenic shock or decompensated heart failure . Sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, and greater than first-degree block unless a permanent pacemaker is in place . Anuria Hypersensitivity to metoprolol tartrate or hydrochlorothiazide or to other sulfonamide- derived drugs.

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Abrupt cessation may exacerbate myocardial ischemia. ( 5.1 ) May worsen congestive heart failure. ( 5.2 ) Bronchospasm: Avoid beta-blockers. ( 5.3 ) Bradycardia. ( 5.4 ) Avoid discontinuing therapy prior to major surgery. ( 5.5 ) Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor. ( 5.6 ) Monitor serum electrolytes and creatinine periodically. ( 5.7 ) Peripheral vascular disease: Can aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency. ( 5.9 ) Pheochromocytoma: First initiate therapy with an alpha blocker. ( 5.10 ) Abrupt withdrawal in thyrotoxicosis might precipitate a thyroid storm. ( 5.11 ) Patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy Following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta adrenergic blockers, exacerbations of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction may occur. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly resume therapy and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension. 5.2 Heart Failure Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of beta-blockers. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of metoprolol. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not precludeÂ subsequent successful titration of metoprolol tartrate. 5.3 Bronchospastic Disease Beta adrenergic blockers can cause bronchospasm. Patients with bronchospastic diseases should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 cardio-selectivity, however, metoprolol tartrate may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of metoprolol tartrate and have bronchodilators (e.g., beta 2 -agonists) readily available or administered concomitantly . 5.4 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, conduction disorders (including Wolff-Parkinson-White) or on concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions ( that cause bradycardia may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. 7 )] 5.5 Major Surgery Avoid initiation of high-dose regimen of metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with cardiovascular risk factors undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since use in such patients has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death. Chronically administered beta adrenergic blockers should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 5.6 Masked Symptoms of Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at anytime during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Electrolyte and Metabolic Effects Metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hydrochlorothiazide reduces clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels. 5.8 Renal Impairment Patients with chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion may be at increased risk for developing acute renal failure on drugs containing hydrochlorothiazide, including metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. 5.9 Peripheral Vascular Disease Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. 5.10 Pheochromocytoma If metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle. 5.11 Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockade may precipitate a thyroid storm. 5.12 Anaphylactic Reaction While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat an allergic reaction. 5.13 Acute Myopia and Second Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma (idiosyncratic reactions). Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of hydrochlorothiazide initiation. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. Given that metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets contains hydrochlorothiazide, if these symptoms occur, discontinue metoprolol tartrate and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Consider prompt medical or surgical treatment if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. 5.14 Exacerbation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Hydrochlorothiazide can exacerbate or activate systemic lupus erythematosus.",
