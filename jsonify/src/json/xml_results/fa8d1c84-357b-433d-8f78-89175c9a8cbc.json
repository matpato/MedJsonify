    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Thiotepa for injection is an alkylating drug indicated: To reduce the risk of graft rejection when used in conjunction with high-dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide as a preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) for pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia. ( 1.1 , 14 ) For treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary. ( 1.2 ) For controlling intracavitary effusions secondary to diffuse or localized neoplastic diseases of various serosal cavities. ( 1.3 ) For treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Class 3 Beta-Thalassemia Thiotepa for injection is indicated to reduce the risk of graft rejection when used in conjunction with high-dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide as a preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) for pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia [see Clinical Studies (14 )]. 1.2 Adenocarcinoma of the Breast or Ovary Thiotepa for injection is indicated for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary. 1.3 Malignant Effusions Thiotepa for injection is indicated for controlling intracavitary effusions secondary to diffuse or localized neoplastic diseases of various serosal cavities. 1.4 Superficial Papillary Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder Thiotepa for injection is indicated for treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Thiotepa for injection is contraindicated in: Patients with severe hypersensitivity to thiotepa [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Concomitant use with live or attenuated vaccines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypersensitivity to the active substance. ( 4 ) Concomitant use with live or attenuated vaccines. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cutaneous toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of thiotepa for injection. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid pregnancy. ( 5.8 ) 5.1\tMyelosuppression The consequence of treatment with high doses of thiotepa together with other chemotherapy at the recommended dose and schedule in the preparative regimen for class 3 beta- thalassemia is profound myelosuppression occurring in all patients. Do not begin the preparative regimen if a stem cell donor is not available. Monitor complete blood counts, and provide supportive care for infections, anemia and thrombocytopenia until there is adequate hematopoietic recovery. For patients receiving thiotepa for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with thiotepa may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with thiotepa. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 5.2\tHypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of thiotepa. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with thiotepa, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see . Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1)] 5.3\tCutaneous Toxicity Thiotepa and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with thiotepa may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of thiotepa. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to thiotepa may also occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case thiotepa solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of thiotepa contact with mucous membranes. 5.4\tConcomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with thiotepa until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Hepatic veno-occlusive disease may occur in patients who have received high-dose thiotepa in conjunction with busulfan and cyclophosphamid e [see . Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin daily through BMT Day +28, and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Adverse Reactions (6.1 )] 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behaviour and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. In pediatric patients treated with thiotepa at the recommended dose in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, 8% developed central nervous system toxicity (seizures and intracranial hemorrhage). Do not exceed the recommended dose of thiotepa. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of thiotepa and provide supportive care. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of thiotepa. Nonclinical Toxicity (13.1) ] 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of thiotepa in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [see . Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with thiotepa for at least 1 year after therapy Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )] [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]",

Adverse Reactions With the Preparative Regimen for Class 3 Beta-Thalassemia The safety of thiotepa was evaluated by retrospective analysis of 76 pediatric patients with class 3 beta-thalassemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation (HSCT) using busulfan and cyclophosphamide with thiotepa (n=25) or without thiotepa (n=51) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Adverse reactions were abstracted retrospectively from the medical records. Serious adverse events that occurred in the thiotepa-treated and control cohort were, respectively: gastrointestinal hemorrhage (4% vs 2%), pneumonia (4% vs 0), seizure (4% vs 2%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (4% vs 0) and veno­occlusive disease (4% vs 2%). By 90 days after HSCT, grades 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease was observed in 7 (28%) patients in the thiotepa cohort and in 13 (26%) patients in the control cohort. By 1-year after transplantation, chronic graft-versus-host disease was observed in 8 (35%) of 23 evaluable patients in the thiotepa cohort, and 7 (14%) of 49 evaluable patients in the control cohort. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with thiotepa from start of the preparative regimen through 30 days after transplantation are shown in Table 3.
