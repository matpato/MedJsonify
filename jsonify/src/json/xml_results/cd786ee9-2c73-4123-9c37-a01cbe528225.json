    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly observed adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and greater than placebo with administration of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 28 mg/day were headache, diarrhea and dizziness.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the placebo-controlled clinical trial of memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules, the proportion of patients in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules group and the placebo group who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 10% and 6%, respectively. The most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules group was dizziness, at a rate of 1.5%. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most commonly observed adverse reactions seen in patients administered memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in the controlled clinical trial, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules group and at a frequency higher than placebo, were headache, diarrhea and dizziness. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were observed at an incidence of ≥ 2% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release capsules group and occurred at a rate greater than placebo.

In clinical trials of memantine, seizures occurred in 0.3% of patients treated with memantine and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo. 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of memantine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: agranulocytosis, leukopenia (including neutropenia), pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: cardiac failure congestive. Cardiac Disorders: pancreatitis. Gastrointestinal Disorders: hepatitis. Hepatobiliary Disorders: suicidal ideation. Psychiatric Disorders: acute renal failure (including increased creatinine and renal insufficiency). Renal and Urinary Disorders: Stevens Johnson syndrome. Skin Disorders:"
