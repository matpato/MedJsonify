CLINOLIPID is indicated in adults and pediatric patients, including term and preterm neonates, as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for parenteral nutrition (PN) when oral or enteral nutrition is not possible, insufficient, or contraindicated. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of CLINOLIPID is contraindicated in patients with the following: • Known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean, peanut or to any of the active or inactive ingredients in CLINOLIPID [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . • Severe disorders of lipid metabolism characterized by hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride >1,000 mg/dL) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . • Known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean, peanut, or any of the active or inactive ingredients. ( 4 ) • Severe disorders of lipid metabolism characterized by hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides >1,000 mg/dL). ( 4 , 5.7 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants: Acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions have been reported. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) • Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease : Increased risk in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for greater than 2 weeks, especially preterm neonates. Monitor liver tests: if abnormalities occur, consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. ( 5.2 , 8.4 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue infusion if reactions occur. ( 5.3 ) • Risk of Infections, Fat Overload Syndrome, Refeeding Syndrome, Hypertriglyceridemia, and Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency : Monitor for signs and symptoms; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.7 , 5.9 ) • Aluminum Toxicity : Increased risk in patients with renal impairment, including preterm neonates. ( 5.8 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants In the postmarketing setting, serious adverse reactions including acute respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, and death have been reported in neonates and infants after rapid infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions. Hypertriglyceridemia was commonly reported. Strictly adhere to the recommended total daily dosage; the hourly infusion rate should not exceed 0.75 mL/kg/hour [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion. The risk due to poor lipid clearance should be considered when administering intravenous lipid emulsions. Carefully monitor the infant’s ability to eliminate the infused lipids from the circulation (e.g., measure serum triglycerides and/or plasma free fatty acid levels). If signs of poor clearance of lipids from the circulation occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 , 5.7 ) and Overdosage (10) ] . 5.2 Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease and Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Risk of Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease Parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD), also referred to as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), can present as cholestasis or hepatic steatosis, and may progress to steatohepatitis with fibrosis and cirrhosis (possibly leading to chronic hepatic failure). The etiology of PNALD is multifactorial; however, intravenously administered phytosterols (plant sterols) contained in plant-derived lipid emulsions, including CLINOLIPID, have been associated with development of PNALD. Monitor liver tests in patients treated with CLINOLIPID and consider discontinuation or dosage reduction if abnormalities occur. Other Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders including cholecystitis and cholelithiasis have developed in some PN-treated patients without preexisting liver disease. Monitor liver tests when administering CLINOLIPID. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early to determine whether these conditions are related to CLINOLIPID use. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions CLINOLIPID contains soybean oil and egg phospholipids, which may cause hypersensitivity reactions. Cross reactions have been observed between soybean and peanut. CLINOLIPID is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to egg, soybean, peanut, or any of the active or inactive ingredients in CLINOLIPID. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop infusion of CLINOLIPID immediately and initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures. 5.4 Infections Lipid emulsions, such as CLINOLIPID, can support microbial growth and are an independent risk factor for the development of catheter-related bloodstream infections. To decrease the risk of infectious complications, ensure aseptic techniques are used for catheter placement, catheter maintenance, and preparation and administration of CLINOLIPID. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection including fever and chills, as well as laboratory test results that might indicate infection (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia). Perform frequent checks of the intravenous catheter insertion site for edema, redness, and discharge. 5.5 Fat Overload Syndrome Fat overload syndrome is a rare condition that has been reported with intravenous lipid formulations and is characterized by a sudden deterioration in the patient's condition (e.g.,   fever, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, hyperlipidemia, hepatomegaly, deteriorating liver function, and central nervous system manifestations such as coma).  A reduced or limited ability to metabolize lipids, accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance (resulting in higher lipid levels), may result in this syndrome. Although fat overload syndrome has been most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dose or infusion rate was exceeded, cases have also been described when the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions. If signs or symptoms of fat overload syndrome occur, stop CLINOLIPID. The syndrome is usually reversible when the infusion of the lipid emulsion is stopped. 5.6 Refeeding Syndrome Administering PN to severely undernourished patients may result in the refeeding syndrome, which is characterized by intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patients become anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, closely monitor severely malnourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intake. 5.7 Hypertriglyceridemia The use of CLINOLIPID is contraindicated in patients with hypertriglyceridemia with serum triglyceride concentrations >1,000 mg/dL. Patients with conditions such as inherited lipid disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndromes have a higher risk of developing hypertriglyceridemia with the use of CLINOLIPID. In addition, patients with hypertriglyceridemia may have worsening of their hypertriglyceridemia with administration of CLINOLIPID. Excessive dextrose administration may further increase such risk. Evaluate patients’ capacity to metabolize and eliminate the infused lipid emulsion by measuring serum triglycerides before the start of infusion (baseline value) and regularly throughout treatment. If triglyceride levels are above 400 mg/dL in adults, stop the CLINOLIPID infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels to avoid clinical consequences of hypertriglyceridemia such as pancreatitis. To minimize the risk of new or worsening of hypertriglyceridemia, assess high-risk patients for their overall energy intake including other sources of lipids and dextrose, as well as concomitant drugs that may affect lipid and dextrose metabolism. 5.8 Aluminum Toxicity CLINOLIPID contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum. The aluminum contained in CLINOLIPID may reach toxic levels with prolonged administration in patients with impaired kidney function. Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions that contain aluminum. Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration of total parenteral nutrition products. 5.9 Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency In pediatric trials, EFAD was defined by calculating the Holman index (the triene [Mead acid] to tetraene [arachidonic acid] ratio; T:T ratio > 0.4). One patient treated with CLINOLIPID became at risk for EFAD (T:T ratio >0.2) after 14 days of treatment. No cases of biochemical EFAD and no cases of clinical EFAD were observed; however, the median treatment duration in three of the four pediatric trials was 15 days or less. There are insufficient data to determine whether CLINOLIPID can supply adequate amounts of essential fatty acids in patients who may need treatment for more than 15 days. Monitor patients for laboratory evidence (e.g., abnormal fatty acid levels) and clinical symptoms of EFAD (e.g., skin manifestations, poor growth). Laboratory testing using the triene to tetraene ratio may not be adequate to diagnose EFAD, and assessment of individual fatty acid levels may be needed. Ensure patients are receiving recommended dosages of CLINOLIPID to prevent EFAD [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Description (11) ] . 5.10 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests Routine Monitoring Monitor fluid status closely in patients with pulmonary edema or heart failure. Throughout treatment, monitor serum triglycerides [see , fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count (including platelets), and coagulation parameters. Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] The lipids contained in CLINOLIPID may interfere with the results of some laboratory tests (e.g., hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, oxygen saturation) if the blood is sampled before the lipids have cleared from the bloodstream. Conduct these tests at least 6 hours after stopping the infusion. CLINOLIPID 20% contains Vitamin K that may counteract anticoagulant activity [see . Drug Interactions (7) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Clinical Decompensation with Rapid Infusion of Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Neonates and Infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Liver Disease and Other Hepatobiliary Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] • Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Fat overload syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Refeeding syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Hypertriglyceridemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] • Aluminum toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] • Essential Fatty Acid Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Most common (≥5%) adverse drug reactions from clinical trials in adults were nausea and vomiting, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypoproteinemia, and abnormal liver function tests.  Most common (≥5%) adverse reactions from clinical trials in pediatric patients were hyperbilirubinemia, patent ductus arteriosus, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, bradycardia, feeding intolerance, neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, increased alkaline phosphatase, atrial septal defect, hyponatremia, sepsis, and infantile apnea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare at 1-866-888-2472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The CLINOLIPID trials had small sample sizes and patients had a variety of underlying medical conditions both between different trials and within the individual trials. Patients had gastrointestinal diseases/dysfunction or were recovering from gastrointestinal or other surgeries, trauma, burns, or were afflicted by other chronic illness. Adult Trials Commonly observed adverse reactions in 261 adult patients who received CLINOLIPID were nausea and vomiting, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypoproteinemia, and abnormal liver function tests and occurred in 2 to 10 % of patients. The largest clinical trial in adult patients (Study 1) enrolled 48 subjects with different underlying diagnoses. Study 2 was a randomized, open label multicenter study that enrolled 22 subjects, aged 32-81 years, who required long-term parenteral nutrition. The most common adverse reactions in Study 1 and Study 2 were infectious complications (urinary tract infection, septicemia, and fever of unknown origin), treatment emergent abnormalities on liver/gallbladder ultrasound and abnormalities of serum chemistries, principally, hepatic function tests. Adverse reactions reported with other intravenous lipid emulsions include hyperlipidemia, hypercoagulability, thrombophlebitis, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions reported in long-term use with other intravenous lipid emulsions include hepatomegaly, jaundice due to central lobular cholestasis, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, abnormalities in liver function tests, brown pigmentation of the liver and overloading syndrome (focal seizures, fever, leukocytosis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and shock). Pediatric Trials The safety of CLINOLIPID in pediatric patients was evaluated in Studies 3, 4, 5, and 6 [see . Clinical Studies (14.2) ] In Study 3, EFAD was defined by calculating the Holman index (the triene [Mead acid] to tetraene [arachidonic acid] ratio; T:T ratio > 0.4). Although no patient developed EFAD, one CLINOLIPID-treated patient who had a T:T ratio that increased from < 0.2 at baseline to > 0.2 at end of study treatment was considered at risk for EFAD. This patient’s arachidonic and linoleic acid levels remained within the normal range. No soybean oil lipid emulsion-treated patients had a T:T ratio ≥ 0.2. In Studies 3, 4, 5, and 6, adverse reactions occurred at similar rates in subjects treated with CLINOLIPID and the 100% soybean oil comparator. Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥5% of patients included hyperbilirubinemia, patent ductus arteriosus, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, bradycardia, feeding intolerance, neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage, increased alkaline phosphatase, atrial septal defect, hyponatremia, sepsis, and infantile apnea. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of CLINOLIPID. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders : Diarrhea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Pruritus Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity with the manifestations of rash and dyspnea Investigations : International normalized ratio (INR) decreased in anticoagulated patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ] Hepatobiliary disorders: cholestasis"
