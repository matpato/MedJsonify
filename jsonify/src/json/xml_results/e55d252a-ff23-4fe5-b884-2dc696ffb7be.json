    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Econazole Nitrate Cream is indicated for topical application in the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis caused by Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum canis, Microsporum audouini, Microsporum gypseum, and Epidermophyton floccosum, in the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis, and in the treatment of tinea versicolor.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Econazole Nitrate Cream is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Econazole Nitrate Cream is not for ophthalmic use.PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. For external use only. Avoid introduction of Econazole Nitrate Cream into the eyes. Drug Interactions Warfarin Concomitant administration of econazole and warfarin has resulted in enhancement of anticoagulation effect. Most cases reported product application with use under occlusion, genital application, or application to large body surface area which may increase the systemic absorption of econazole nitrate. Monitoring of International Normalized Ratio (INR) and/or prothrombin time may be indicated especially for patients who apply econazole to large body surface areas, in the genital area, or under occlusion. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility Long-term animal studies to determine carcinogenic potential have not been performed. Oral administration of econazole nitrate in rats has been reported to produce prolonged gestation. Intravaginal administration in humans has not shown prolonged gestation or other adverse reproductive effects attributable to econazole nitrate therapy. Pregnancy Econazole nitrate has not been shown to be teratogenic when administered orally to mice, rabbits or rats. Fetotoxic or embryotoxic effects were observed in Segment I oral studies with rats receiving 10 to 40 times the human dermal dose. Similar effects were observed in Segment II or Segment III studies with mice, rabbits and/or rats receiving oral doses 80 or 40 times the human dermal dose. Econazole nitrate should be used in the first trimester of pregnancy only when the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. The drug should be used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether econazole nitrate is excreted in human milk. Following oral administration of econazole nitrate to lactating rats, econazole and/or metabolites were excreted in milk and were found in nursing pups. Also, in lactating rats receiving large oral doses (40 or 80 times the human dermal dose), there was a reduction in post partum viability of pups and survival to weaning; however, at these high doses, maternal toxicity was present and may have been a contributing factor. Caution should be exercised when econazole nitrate is administered to a nursing woman. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of econazole nitrate cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS During clinical trials, approximately 3% of patients treated with econazole nitrate cream, 1% reported side effects thought possibly to be due to the drug, consisting mainly of burning, itching, stinging, and erythema. One case of pruritic rash has also been reported."
