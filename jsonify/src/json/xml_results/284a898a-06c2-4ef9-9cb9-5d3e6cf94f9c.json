    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ABILIFY ASIMTUFII is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to aripiprazole, or any of the excipients. Hypersensitivity reactions ranging from pruritus/urticaria to anaphylaxis have been reported in patients receiving aripiprazole [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Known hypersensitivity to aripiprazole, or to any excipients of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis : Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack, including fatalities) ( 5.2 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome : Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring ( 5.3 ) Tardive Dyskinesia : Discontinue if clinically appropriate ( 5.4 ) Metabolic Changes : Monitor for hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain ( 5.5 ) Pathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors : Consider dose reduction or discontinuation ( 5.6 ) Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope : Monitor heart rate and blood pressure and caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, and risk of dehydration or syncope ( 5.7 ) Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis: Perform complete blood counts (CBC) in patients with history of clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenia or neutropenia. Consider discontinuing ABILIFY ASIMTUFII if clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors ( 5.9 ) Seizures : Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold ( 5.10 ) Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment : Use caution when operating machinery ( 5.11 ) 5.1\tIncreased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ABILIFY ASIMTUFII is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see . Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] 5.2\tCerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled clinical studies (two flexible-dose and one fixed-dose study) of dementia-related psychosis, there was an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, in oral aripiprazole-treated patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). In the fixed-dose study, there was a statistically significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with oral aripiprazole. ABILIFY ASIMTUFII is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.3\tNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex has been reported with antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment in the global clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and provide symptomatic treatment and monitoring. 5.4\tTardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose increases. The syndrome can develop, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and may mask the underlying process. The effect of symptomatic suppression on the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, ABILIFY ASIMTUFII should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.5\tMetabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with diabetic   ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with aripiprazole [see . Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes), who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics, including ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the atypical antipsychotic drug. In a short-term, placebo-controlled randomized trial in adults with schizophrenia, the mean change in fasting glucose was +9.8 mg/dL (N=88) in the Abilify Maintena-treated patients (once monthly dosing) and +0.7 mg/dL (N=59) in the placebo-treated patients. Table 3 shows the proportion of Abilify Maintena-treated patients with normal and borderline fasting glucose at baseline and their changes in fasting glucose measurements.

Combined, 2.9% of these patients with normal or borderline fasting glucose experienced shifts to high fasting glucose during this trial. Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Table 4 shows the proportion of adult patients from one short-term, placebo-controlled randomized trial in adults with schizophrenia taking Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing), with changes in total cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, fasting LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.

Of these patients with normal baseline triglycerides, 3.6% experienced shifts to high, and 0.0% experienced shifts to very high. Combined, 1.0% of these patients with normal or borderline fasting triglycerides experienced shifts to very high fasting triglycerides during this trial. Weight Gain Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended. In one short-term, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with schizophrenia with Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing), the mean change in body weight at Week 12 was +3.5 kg (N=99) in the Abilify Maintena-treated patients and +0.8 kg (N=66) in the placebo-treated patients. Table 5 shows the percentage of adult patients with schizophrenia with weight gain ≥7% of body weight in a short-term, placebo-controlled trial with Abilify Maintena. Table 5: Percentage of Patients From a 12-Week Placebo-Controlled Trial with Abilify Maintena in Adult Patients with Schizophrenia with Weight Gain ≥7% of Body Weight Treatment Arm N N = the total number of subjects who had a measurement at baseline and at least one post-baseline result. Patients n (%) Weight gain ≥7% of body weight Abilify Maintena 144 31 (21.5) Placebo 141 12 (8.5) During a 52-week, open-label bipolar I disorder study in those patients who initiated Abilify Maintena, 1.8% discontinued Abilify Maintena treatment due to weight increase. Abilify Maintena was associated with mean increase from baseline in weight of 1.0 kg at Week 52. In this trial, 21.4% of these patients demonstrated ≥7% increase in body weight and 15.4% demonstrated a ≥7% decrease in body weight. 5.6\tPathological Gambling and Other Compulsive Behaviors Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include: sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the underlying disorder. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced, or the medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviors may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges. 5.7\tOrthostatic Hypotension and Syncope ABILIFY ASIMTUFII may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated reactions related to orthostatic hypotension can include dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial in adults with schizophrenia, the adverse reaction of presyncope was reported in 1/167 (0.6%) of patients treated with Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing), while syncope and orthostatic hypotension were each reported in 1/172 (0.6%) of patients treated with placebo. During the stabilization phase of the randomized-withdrawal (maintenance) study in adult patients with schizophrenia, orthostasis-related adverse events were reported in 4/576 (0.7%) of patients treated with Abilify Maintena, including abnormal orthostatic blood pressure (1/576, 0.2%), postural dizziness (1/576, 0.2%), presyncope (1/576, 0.2%) and orthostatic hypotension (1/576, 0.2%). In the short-term placebo-controlled trial of Abilify Maintena in adults with schizophrenia, there were no patients in either treatment group with a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥20 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate ≥25 bpm when comparing standing to supine values). During the stabilization phase of the randomized-withdrawal (maintenance) study in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of significant orthostatic change in blood pressure was 0.2% (1/575). Use ABILIFY ASIMTUFII with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (heart failure, history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension. 5.8\tFalls Antipsychotics, including ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.9\tLeukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including aripiprazole. Agranulocytosis has also been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue ABILIFY ASIMTUFII in patients with severe neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm 3 ) and follow their WBC counts until recovery. 5.10\tSeizures As with other antipsychotic drugs, use ABILIFY ASIMTUFII cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.11\tPotential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, like other antipsychotics, may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Instruct patients to be cautious about performing activities that require mental alertness such as operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicle, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII does not affect them adversely. 5.12\tBody Temperature Regulation Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ABILIFY ASIMTUFII for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, (e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration). 5.13\tDysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use, including aripiprazole. ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration .",

The safety of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and maintenance monotherapy treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults is based on adequate and well-controlled studies of Abilify Maintena. The safety data from those studies is presented below. Safety Database of Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing) and Oral Aripiprazole. Oral aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 16,114 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia and other indications, and who had approximately 8,578 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole. A total of 3,901 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days, 2,259 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 360 days, and 933 patients continuing aripiprazole treatment for at least 720 days. Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing) has been evaluated for safety in 2,128 adult patients in clinical trials in schizophrenia, with approximately 2,633 patient-years of exposure to Abilify Maintena. A total of 1,229 patients were treated with Abilify Maintena for at least 180 days (at least 7 consecutive injections) and 935 patients treated with Abilify Maintena had at least 1 year of exposure (at least 13 consecutive injections). Abilify Maintena has been evaluated for safety in 804 adult patients in clinical trials in bipolar I disorder, with approximately 530 patient-years of exposure to Abilify Maintena. A total of 419 patients were treated with Abilify Maintena for at least 180 days (at least 7 consecutive injections) and 287 patients treated with Abilify Maintena had at least 1 year of exposure (at least 13 consecutive injections). Safety Database of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII (once every 2 month dosing) In a 32 week open-label study of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII in adult patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder, 266 patients were randomized to receive either ABILIFY ASIMTUFII 960 mg (132 patients) or Abilify Maintena 400 mg (134 patients). A total of the 132 patients received at least one injection of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, a total of 114 patients received at least two consecutive injections (4 months treatment) of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, and a total of 104 patients received at least four consecutive injections (8 months treatment) of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII. Of the total 266 patients receiving ABILIFY ASIMTUFII 960 mg or Abilify Maintena 400 mg, 185 had schizophrenia and 81 had bipolar I disorder. Injection site reactions for ABILIFY ASIMTUFII (once every 2 month dosing) presented in this section is based on this open-label study (see section titled \" Injection Site Reactions with Abilify ASIMTUFII \"). Adverse Reactions in Studies with Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing) The conditions and duration of treatment with Abilify Maintena included double-blind and open-label studies. The safety data presented below are derived from the 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled study of Abilify Maintena in adult patients with schizophrenia. Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials in Schizophrenia with Abilify Maintena Based on the placebo-controlled trial of Abilify Maintena in schizophrenia, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of Abilify Maintena in patients (incidence of 5% or greater and aripiprazole incidence at least twice that for placebo) were increased weight (16.8% vs. 7.0%), akathisia (11.4% vs. 3.5%), injection site pain (5.4% vs. 0.6%) and sedation (5.4% vs. 1.2%). Commonly Reported Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials in Schizophrenia with Abilify Maintena The following findings are based on the double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that compared Abilify Maintena 400 mg or 300 mg to placebo in patients with schizophrenia. Table 6 lists the adverse reactions reported in 2% or more of Abilify Maintena-treated patients and at a greater proportion than in the placebo group. Table 6:\tAdverse Reactions in ≥2% of Adult Patients with Schizophrenia Treated with Abilify Maintena in a 12-Week Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study This table does not include adverse reactions which had an incidence equal to or less than placebo. Preferred Term Abilify Maintena (n=167) Placebo (n=172) Gastrointestinal Disorders Constipation 10 7 Dry Mouth 4 2 Diarrhea 3 2 Vomiting 3 1 Abdominal Discomfort 2 1 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Injection Site Pain 5 1 Infections and Infestations Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 4 2 Investigations Increased Weight 17 7 Decreased Weight 4 2 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 4 1 Back Pain 4 2 Myalgia 4 2 Musculoskeletal pain 3 1 Nervous System Disorders Akathisia 11 4 Sedation 5 1 Dizziness 4 2 Tremor 3 1 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Nasal Congestion 2 1 Demographic Differences An examination of population subgroups was performed across demographic subgroup categories for adverse reactions experienced by at least 5% of Abilify Maintena patients at least twice the rate of placebo (i.e., increased weight, akathisia, injection site pain, and sedation) in the double-blind placebo-controlled trial. This analysis did not reveal evidence of differences in safety differential adverse reaction incidence on the basis of age, gender, or race alone; however, there were few patients ≥65 years of age. Injection Site Reactions with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII ABILIFY ASIMTUFII was evaluated in 266 patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in an open-label, multiple-dose, randomized, parallel-arm multi-center study. The percentage of patients in the open-label study reporting any injection site-related adverse reactions (all reported as injection site pain) was 19% for patients treated with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII 960 mg and 9% for patients treated with Abilify Maintena 400 mg. In both treatment groups, the majority of the injection site pain events coincided with the first injection of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII 960 mg (21/24 patients) or Abilify Maintena 400 mg (7/12 patients), was reported with decreasing frequency upon subsequent injections. The overall mean visual analog scale scores (0=no pain to 100=unbearably painful) for patient reported rating of pain were similar in both treatment groups at the last injection: 0.8 pre-dose and 1.4 post-dose for the ABILIFY ASIMTUFII 960 mg group compared to 1.3 post-dose for the Abilify Maintena 400 mg group. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial of Abilify Maintena in adults with schizophrenia, the incidence of reported EPS-related events, excluding events related to akathisia, for Abilify Maintena-treated patients was 9.6% vs. 5.2% for placebo. The incidence of akathisia-related events for Abilify Maintena-treated patients was 11.5% vs. 3.5% for placebo. Dystonia Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial of Abilify Maintena in adults with schizophrenia, the incidence of dystonia was 1.8% for Abilify Maintena vs. 0.6% for placebo. Neutropenia In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial of Abilify Maintena in adults with schizophrenia, the incidence of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count ≤1.5 thous/mcL) for Abilify Maintena-treated patients was 5.7% vs. 2.1% for placebo. An absolute neutrophil count of <1 thous/mcL (i.e., 0.95 thous/mcL) was observed in only one patient on Abilify Maintena and resolved spontaneously without any associated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Other Adverse Reactions During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Abilify Maintena The following listing does not include reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.
