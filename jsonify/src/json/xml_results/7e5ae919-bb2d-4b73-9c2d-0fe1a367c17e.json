    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% or 0.15% is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% or 0.15% is an alpha adrenergic agonist indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Neonates and infants  (pediatric patients younger than 2 years old). ( ) 4.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions. ( 4.2 ) 4.1 Neonates and Infants ( Pediatric Patients Younger than 2 Years Old ) Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% is contraindicated in neonates and infants (pediatric patients younger than 2 years old) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 4.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% is contraindicated in patients who have exhibited a hypersensitivity reaction to any component of this medication in the past.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potentiation of vascular insufficiency. ( ) 5.1 5.1 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0.1% and 0.15% should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud’s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.2 Severe C ardiovascular Disease Although brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution had minimal effect on the blood pressure of patients in clinical studies, caution should be exercised in treating patients with severe cardiovascular disease. 5.3 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. Do not touch the tip of the dispensing container to the eye or surrounding structures. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] .",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Severe Cardiovascular Disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products after Use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Neonates and Infants (Pediatric Patients Younger than 2 Years Old) [ see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) ] Most common adverse reactions occurring in approximately 5% to 20% of patients receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1% to 0.2%) included allergic conjunctivitis, burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, conjunctival hyperemia, eye pruritus, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. ( ) 6.1 To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie at 1-800-678-1605 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10% to 20% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1% to 0.2%) included: allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and eye pruritus. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 5% to 9% included: burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. Adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1% to 4% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1% to 0.2%) included: abnormal taste, allergic reaction, asthenia, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchitis, cataract, conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, fatigue, flu syndrome, follicular conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypotension, infection (primarily colds and respiratory infections), insomnia, keratitis, lid disorder, pharyngitis, photophobia, rash, rhinitis, sinus infection, sinusitis, somnolence, stinging, superficial punctate keratopathy, tearing, visual field defect, vitreous detachment, vitreous disorder, vitreous floaters, and worsened visual acuity. The following reactions were reported in less than 1% of subjects: corneal erosion, hordeolum, nasal dryness, and taste perversion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postapproval use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia. Apnea, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions."
