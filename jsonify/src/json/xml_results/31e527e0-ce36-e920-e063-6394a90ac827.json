    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are indicated for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are nitrate vasodilator indicated for relief of an attack or prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, such as avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil, or soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. ( 4.1 , 7.1 ) Severe anemia ( 4.2 ) Increased intracranial pressure ( 4.3 ) Hypersensitivity to nitroglycerin sublingual tablets or to other nitrates or nitrites or any excipient ( 4.4 ) Circulatory failure and shock ( 4.5 ) 4.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking PDE-5 Inhibitors, such as avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil hydrochloride. Concomitant use can cause severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Do not use nitroglycerin sublingual tablets in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, such as riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension. 4.2 Severe Anemia Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe anemia (large doses of nitroglycerin may cause oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin and could exacerbate anemia). 4.3 Increased Intracranial Pressure Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets may precipitate or aggravate increased intracranial pressure and thus should not be used in patients with possible increased intracranial pressure (e.g., cerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury). 4.4 Hypersensitivity Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are allergic to nitroglycerin, other nitrates or nitrites or any excipient. 4.5 Circulatory Failure and Shock Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute circulatory failure or shock.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Tolerance Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates. 5.2 Hypotension Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses. 5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5.4 Headache Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail elsewhere in the label: Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Headache [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.4) ] Vertigo, dizziness, weakness, palpitation, and other manifestations of postural hypotension may develop occasionally, particularly in erect, immobile patients. Marked sensitivity to the hypotensive effects of nitrates (manifested by nausea, vomiting, weakness, diaphoresis, pallor, and collapse) may occur at therapeutic doses. Syncope due to nitrate vasodilatation has been reported. Flushing, drug rash, and exfoliative dermatitis have been reported in patients receiving nitrate therapy. Most common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency greater than 2% are headache, dizziness and paresthesia.
