    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac conduction abnormalities: PR interval prolongation may occur in some patients. ECG monitoring should be considered in patients with preexisting conduction system disease or when administered with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval. (5.1, 7.3 , 12.2 , 17 ) Severe Skin Reactions: Discontinue if severe rash develops. ( 5.2 , 17 ) Hyperbilirubinemia: Most patients experience asymptomatic increases in indirect bilirubin, which is reversible upon discontinuation. Do not dose reduce. If a concomitant transaminase increase occurs, evaluate for alternative etiologies. ( 5.8 ) Hepatotoxicity: Patients with hepatitis B or C virus are at risk of increased transaminases or hepatic decompensation. Monitor hepatic laboratory tests prior to therapy and during treatment. ( 2.8 , 5.4 , 8.8 ) Chronic kidney disease has been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir. Consider alternatives in patients at high risk for renal disease or with preexisting renal disease. Monitor renal laboratory tests prior to therapy and during treatment. Consider discontinuation of atazanavir in patients with progressive renal disease. ( 5.5 ) Nephrolithiasis and cholelithiasis have been reported. Consider temporary interruption or discontinuation. ( 5.6 ) The concomitant use of atazanavir with ritonavir and certain other medications may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. ( 5.7 , 7.3 ) Patients receiving atazanavir may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia ( 5.9 ), immune reconstitution syndrome ( 5.10 ), and redistribution/accumulation of body fat. ( 5.11 ) Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur, and additional factor VIII may be required. ( 5.12 ) 5.1 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Atazanavir has been shown to prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram in some study participants. In healthy participants and in participants with HIV-1 treated with atazanavir, abnormalities in atrioventricular (AV) conduction were asymptomatic and generally limited to first-degree AV block. There have been reports of second-degree AV block and other conduction abnormalities . In clinical trials that included electrocardiograms, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed in 5.9% of atazanavir­treated participants (n=920), 5.2% of lopinavir/ritonavir-treated participants (n=252), 10.4% of nelfinavir­treated participants (n=48), and 3.0% of efavirenz-treated participants (n=329). In Study AI424-045, asymptomatic first-degree AV block was observed in 5% (6/118) of atazanavir with ritonavir­treated participants and 5% (6/116) of lopinavir/ritonavir-treated participants who had on-study electrocardiogram measurements. Because of limited clinical experience in those with preexisting conduction system disease (eg, marked first-degree AV block or second- or third-degree AV block), ECG monitoring should be considered in these patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) and Overdosage ( 10 )] [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . )] 12.2 5.2 Severe Skin Reactions In controlled clinical trials, rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in approximately 20% of participants with HIV-1 treated with atazanavir. The median time to onset of rash in clinical studies was 7.3 weeks and the median duration of rash was 1.4 weeks. Rashes were generally mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions of moderate or severe rash (occurring at a rate of ≥2%) are presented for the individual clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions ( . Dosing with atazanavir was often continued without interruption in patients who developed rash. The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was <1%. Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and toxic skin eruptions, including drug rash, eosinophilia, and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, have been reported in patients receiving atazanavir 6.1 )] [see Contraindications ( . Atazanavir should be discontinued if severe rash develops. 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C virus or marked elevations in transaminases before treatment may be at increased risk for developing further transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation. In these patients, hepatic laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with atazanavir and during treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )] 5.5 Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease in patients with HIV-1 treated with atazanavir, with or without ritonavir, has been reported during postmarketing surveillance. Reports included biopsy-proven cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis associated with the deposition of atazanavir drug crystals in the renal parenchyma. Consider alternatives to atazanavir in patients at high risk for renal disease or with preexisting renal disease. Renal laboratory testing (including serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, and urinalysis with microscopic examination) should be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy with atazanavir and continued during treatment with atazanavir. Expert consultation is advised for patients who have confirmed renal laboratory abnormalities while taking atazanavir. In patients with progressive kidney disease, discontinuation of atazanavir may be considered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 and 2.7 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving atazanavir therapy. Some patients required hospitalization for additional management, and some had complications. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and/or cholelithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of atazanavir with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir with ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to: clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications. clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir with ritonavir. loss of therapeutic effect (virologic response) of atazanavir with ritonavir and possible development of resistance. See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions ( . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy containing atazanavir with ritonavir; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with concomitant medications 7 )] [see Contraindications ( . 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] 5.8 Hyperbilirubinemia Most patients taking atazanavir experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT). This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir. Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies. No long-term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin >5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients. Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long-term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.9 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia New-onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV-1 receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.10 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including atazanavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium , cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.11 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and “cushingoid appearance” have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.12 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis, in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established. 5.13 Resistance/Cross-Resistance Various degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed. Resistance to atazanavir may not preclude the subsequent use of other protease inhibitors [see Microbiology ( . 12.4 )]",

Change in Lipids from Baseline in Treatment-Experienced Participants with HIV-1 For Study AI424-045, changes from baseline in LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides are shown in Table 15. The observed magnitude of dyslipidemia was less with atazanavir with ritonavir than with lopinavir/ritonavir. However, the clinical impact of such findings has not been demonstrated.

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Participants with HIV-1: Atazanavir Capsules The safety and tolerability of atazanavir capsules with and without ritonavir have been established in pediatric participants with HIV-1, at least 6 years of age from the open-label, multicenter clinical trial PACTG 1020A. The safety profile of atazanavir in pediatric participants with HIV-1 (6 to less than 18 years of age) taking the capsule formulation was generally similar to that observed in clinical studies of atazanavir in adults. The most common Grade 2 to 4 adverse events (≥5%, regardless of causality) reported in pediatric participants were cough (21%), fever (18%), jaundice/scleral icterus (15%), rash (14%), vomiting (12%), diarrhea (9%), headache (8%), peripheral edema (7%), extremity pain (6%), nasal congestion (6%), oropharyngeal pain (6%), wheezing (6%), and rhinorrhea (6%). Asymptomatic second-degree atrioventricular block was reported in <2% of participants. The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities occurring in pediatric participants taking the capsule formulation were elevation of total bilirubin (≥3.2 mg/dL, 58%), neutropenia (9%), and hypoglycemia (4%). All other Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred with a frequency of less than 3%. Adverse Reactions in Participants with HIV-1 and Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus In Study AI424-138, 60 participants administered atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, and 51 participants treated with lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg (as fixed-dose product) twice daily, each with fixed-dose tenofovir DF/emtricitabine, were seropositive for hepatitis B and/or C at study entry. ALT levels >5 times ULN developed in 10% (6/60) of the participants administered atazanavir with ritonavir and 8% (4/50) of the participants treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. AST levels >5 times ULN developed in 10% (6/60) of the participants administered atazanavir with ritonavir and none (0/50) of the participants treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. In Study AI424-045, 20 participants administered atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily, and 18 participants treated with lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg/100 mg twice daily (as fixed-dose product), were seropositive for hepatitis B and/or C at study entry. ALT levels >5 times ULN developed in 25% (5/20) of the participants administered atazanavir with ritonavir and 6% (1/18) of the participants treated with lopinavir/ritonavir-treated. AST levels >5 times ULN developed in 10% (2/20) of the participants administered atazanavir with ritonavir and 6% (1/18) of the participants treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. In Studies AI424-008 and AI424-034, 74 participants treated with atazanavir 400 mg once daily, 58 who received efavirenz, and 12 who received nelfinavir were seropositive for hepatitis B and/or C at study entry. ALT levels >5 times ULN developed in 15% of the participants treated with atazanavir, 14% of the participants treated with efavirenz, and 17% of the participants treated with nelfinavir. AST levels >5 times ULN developed in 9% of the participants treated with atazanavir, 5% of the participants treated with efavirenz, and 17% of the participants treated with nelfinavir. Within atazanavir and control regimens, no difference in frequency of bilirubin elevations was noted between seropositive and seronegative participants [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.8 )] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of atazanavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: edema Cardiovascular System: second-degree AV block, third-degree AV block, left bundle branch block, QTc prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Gastrointestinal System: pancreatitis Hepatic System: hepatic function abnormalities Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholelithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( , cholecystitis, cholestasis 5.6 )] Metabolic System and Nutrition Disorders: diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia Renal System: nephrolithiasis [see Warnings and Precautions ( interstitial nephritis, granulomatous interstitial nephritis, chronic kidney disease 5.6 )], [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Skin and Appendages: alopecia, maculopapular rash [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( pruritus, angioedema 5.2 )],"
