    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is indicated for the treatment of itching of the eye associated with allergic conjunctivitis.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in persons with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of its components.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is for ocular use only and not for injection or oral use.PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients: To prevent contaminating the dropper tip and solution, care should be taken not to touch any surface, the eyelids, or surrounding areas with the dropper tip of the bottle. Keep bottle tightly closed when not in use. This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Azelastine hydrochloride administered orally for 24 months was not carcinogenic in rats and mice at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day, respectively. Based on a 30 μL drop size, these doses were approximately 25,000 and 21,000 times higher than the maximum recommended ocular human use level of 0.001 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg adult. Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses of up to 25,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level), the duration of the estrous cycle was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; however, the implantation ratio was not affected. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Azelastine hydrochloride has been shown to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic (external and skeletal abnormalities) in mice at an oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the recommended ocular human use level). At an oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day (25,000 times the recommended ocular human use level), delayed ossification (undeveloped metacarpus) and the incidence of 14 th rib were increased in rats. At 68.6 mg/kg/day (57,000 times the maximum recommended ocular human use level) azelastine hydrochloride caused resorption and fetotoxic effects in rats. The relevance to humans of these skeletal findings noted at only high drug exposure levels is unknown. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether azelastine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when azelastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 3 have not been established. Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled multiple-dose studies where patients were treated for up to 56 days, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were transient eye burning/stinging (approximately 30%), headaches (approximately 15%) and bitter taste (approximately 10%). The occurrence of these events was generally mild. The following events were reported in 1–10% of patients: asthma, conjunctivitis, dyspnea, eye pain, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms, pharyngitis, pruritus, rhinitis and temporary blurring. Some of these events were similar to the underlying disease being studied.
