    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE VABOMERE (meropenem and vaborbactam) is a combination of meropenem, a penem antibacterial, and vaborbactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of patients 18 years and older with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis caused by designated susceptible bacteria. ( 1.1 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of VABOMERE and other antibacterial drugs, VABOMERE should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. ( 1.2 ) 1.1.\tComplicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis VABOMERE Â® is indicated for the treatment of patients 18 years of age and older with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Enterobacter cloacae species complex. 1.2.\tUsage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of VABOMERE and other antibacterial drugs, VABOMERE should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS VABOMERE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any components of VABOMERE (meropenem and vaborbactam), or to other drugs in the same class or in patients who have demonstrated anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Known hypersensitivity to the components of VABOMERE (meropenem and vaborbactam) or anaphylactic reactions to beta-lactams. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions were reported with the use of VABOMERE. Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Discontinue infusion if signs of acute hypersensitivity occur. ( 5.1 ) Seizures and other adverse Central Nervous System experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem, a component of VABOMERE. ( 5.2 ) Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed, discontinue VABOMERE and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including VABOMERE. Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.4 ) Co-administration of meropenem with valproic acid or divalproex sodium reduces the serum concentration of valproic acid potentially increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. ( 5.5 , 7.1 ) 5.1\tHypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in patients treated with VABOMERE in the clinical trials [see . Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.  There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with another beta-lactam antibacterial drug. Before initiating therapy with VABOMERE, it is important to inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction to VABOMERE occurs, discontinue the drug immediately. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.2\tSeizure Potential Seizures and other adverse Central Nervous System (CNS) experiences have been reported during treatment with meropenem, which is a component of VABOMERE. These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) or with bacterial meningitis and/or compromised renal function [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimens is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Continue anti-convulsant therapy in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, evaluate neurologically, place on anti-convulsant therapy if not already instituted, and reexamine the dosage of VABOMERE to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued. 5.3 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of meropenem, a component of VABOMERE [see ] Adverse Reactions (6.2) . If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue VABOMERE and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including VABOMERE, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.5\tRisk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid The concomitant use of VABOMERE and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. Consider administration of antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. If administration of VABOMERE is necessary, consider supplemental anticonvulsant therapy [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] 5.6\tThrombocytopenia In patients with renal impairment, thrombocytopenia has been observed in patients treated with meropenem, but no clinical bleeding has been reported [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.7\tPotential for Neuromotor Impairment Alert patients receiving VABOMERE on an outpatient basis regarding adverse reactions such as seizures, delirium, headaches and/or paresthesias that could interfere with mental alertness and/or cause motor impairment. Until it is reasonably well established that VABOMERE is well tolerated, advise patients not to operate machinery or motorized vehicles [see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) 5.8\tDevelopment of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing VABOMERE in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of drug-resistant bacteria [see . Indications and Usage (1.2) ] 5.9\tOvergrowth of Non-susceptible Organisms As with other antibacterial drugs, prolonged use of VABOMERE may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient is essential. If superinfection does occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.",

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Melinta Therapeutics at 1-844-633-6568 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. VABOMERE was evaluated in a Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trial in cUTI, including pyelonephritis, which included 272 patients treated with VABOMERE and 273 patients treated with the comparator piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 grams (piperacillin 4 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) every 8 hours. After a minimum of 15 doses of IV therapy, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily every 24 hours) to complete the treatment course. Mean duration of IV therapy was 8 days in both treatment groups. Mean duration of IV and oral therapy was 10 days; patients with baseline bacteremia could receive up to 14 days of treatment. The mean age of patients treated with VABOMERE was 53 years (range 18 to 92 years), and 32% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly female (66.5%) and White (93.4%). Most patients were enrolled in Europe (89.7%). Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 2.9% (8/272) of patients receiving VABOMERE and in 5.1% (14/273) of patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam. Most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of VABOMERE included hypersensitivity, 1.1% (3/272) and infusion-related reactions, 0.7% (2/272). Death occurred in 2 (0.7%) patients who received VABOMERE and in 2 (0.7%) patients who received piperacillin/tazobactam. Common Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions (3% or greater) in patients receiving VABOMERE in the Phase 3 cUTI trial were headache, phlebitis/infusion site reactions, and diarrhea. Table 3 provides adverse reactions occurring in 1% or greater of patients receiving VABOMERE in the Phase 3 cUTI trial.
