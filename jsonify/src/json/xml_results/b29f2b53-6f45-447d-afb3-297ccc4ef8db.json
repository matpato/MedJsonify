    "indications": "1\tINDICATIONS AND USAGE FOSRENOL ® is a phosphate binder indicated to reduce serum phosphate in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Management of elevated serum phosphorus levels in patients with ESRD usually includes all of the following: reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, removal of phosphate by dialysis, and reduction of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders. FOSRENOL is a phosphate binder indicated to reduce serum phosphate in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4\tCONTRAINDICATIONS Contraindicated in patients with: - hypersensitivity to FOSRENOL or to any ingredient in the formulation. - bowel obstruction, including ileus and fecal impaction. Hypersensitivity to FOSRENOL or to any ingredient in the formulation. ( 4 ) Bowel obstruction, ileus, and fecal impaction. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5\tWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of gastrointestinal obstruction, ileus, subileus, gastrointestinal perforation, and fecal impaction. Risks include altered gastrointestinal anatomy, hypomotility disorders, and concomitant medications. Advise patients to chew or crush the tablet completely. ( 5.1 ) FOSRENOL has radio-opaque properties and, therefore, may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures. ( 5.2 ) 5.1\tGastrointestinal Adverse Effects Serious cases of gastrointestinal obstruction, ileus, subileus, gastrointestinal perforation, and fecal impaction have been reported in patients taking lanthanum, some requiring surgery or hospitalization. Consider discontinuing FOSRENOL in patients without another explanation for severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction and gastrointestinal perforation identified from post-marketing reports in patients taking FOSRENOL Chewable Tablets include abnormal gastrointestinal anatomy (e.g., diverticular disease, peritonitis, history of gastrointestinal surgery, gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal ulceration), hypomotility disorders (e.g., constipation, ileus, subileus, diabetic gastroparesis), and the use of medications known to potentiate these effects. Some cases were reported in patients with no history of gastrointestinal disease. Patients with acute peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or bowel obstruction were not included in FOSRENOL clinical studies [see . Contraindications (4) ] Advise patients who are prescribed FOSRENOL Chewable Tablets to chew the tablet completely and not to swallow them whole. Serious gastrointestinal complications have been reported in association with unchewed or incompletely chewed tablets [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] 5.2\tDiagnostic Tests FOSRENOL has radio-opaque properties and therefore may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures. Postmarketing reports of product residue have been reported during endoscopic imaging.",
    "adverseReactions": "6\tADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] In controlled trials, the most common adverse reactions that were more frequent (≥5% difference vs. placebo) in FOSRENOL were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FOSRENOL: constipation, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, and tooth injury while chewing the tablet. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. at 1-877-TAKEDA-7 (1-877-825-3327) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Overall, the safety profile of FOSRENOL has been studied in over 5,200 subjects in completed clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions for FOSRENOL were gastrointestinal events, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and they generally abated over time with continued dosing. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies where a total of 180 and 95 patients with ESRD were randomized to FOSRENOL chewable tablet and placebo, respectively, for 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, the most common reactions that were more frequent (≥5% difference) in the FOSRENOL group were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (Table 1). Table 1. Adverse Reactions Expressed as the event rate for each term That Were More Common on FOSRENOL in Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Studies with Treatment Periods of 4 to 6 Weeks FOSRENOL % (N=180) Placebo % (N=95) Nausea 11 5 Vomiting 9 4 Abdominal pain 5 0 In an open-label, long-term 2-year extension study in 93 patients who had transitioned from other studies, resulting in a total of up to 6 years treatment, mean baseline values and changes in transaminases were similar to those observed in the earlier comparative studies, with little change during treatment. The safety of FOSRENOL was studied in two long-term, open-label clinical trials, which included 1,215 patients treated with FOSRENOL and 944 with alternative therapy. Fourteen percent (14%) of patients treated with FOSRENOL discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were the most common types of event leading to discontinuation. In pooled active comparator controlled clinical trials, hypocalcemia was noted with an incidence of approximately 5% in both lanthanum and active comparator groups. A nonclinical study and a phase 1 study have shown reduced absorption of calcium in the intestine with lanthanum carbonate treatment. In a crossover study in 72 healthy individuals comparing FOSRENOL Chewable Tablets to FOSRENOL Oral Powder, gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were more common for the oral powder formulation (18%) than for the chewable tablets (7%). 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FOSRENOL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cases of constipation, intestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction, ileus, subileus, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, hypophosphatemia, and tooth injury while chewing the tablet have been reported."
