    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients who have had transient ischemia of the brain or completed ischemic stroke due to thrombosis. Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, antiplatelet agents, indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients who have had transient ischemia of the brain or completed ischemic stroke due to thrombosis ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to any product ingredients (4.1) Patients with known allergy to NSAIDs (4.2) Patients with the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps (4.2) 4.1 Hypersensitivity Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsule is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the product components. 4.2 Allergy Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) products and in patients with the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Aspirin may cause severe urticaria, angioedema or bronchospasm. 4.3 Reye Syndrome Do not use aspirin in children or teenagers with viral infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increases the risk of bleeding ( 5.1 ) Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) Interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules 48 hours before using intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents for stress testing ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole increases the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs) [ see ]. Drug Interactions (7.1) Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur . In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspirin group, and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. Alcohol Warning Because aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules contains aspirin, counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. 5.2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [ see ]. Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ see ]. Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) 5.4 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect. Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole. For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) or angina pectoris, the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications. 5.5 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension. 5.6 Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents Clinicalexperience suggests that patients being treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules for 48 hours prior to stress testing [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Intakeof aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules within 48 hours prior to stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents may increase the risk for cardiovascular side effects of these agents and may impair the sensitivity of the test. 5.7 General Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [ see ] Contraindications (4.1) Allergy [ see ] Contraindications (4.2) Risk of Bleeding [ see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.1) The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>10% and greater than placebo) were headache, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA, Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2). ESPS2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry. Patients were randomized to either aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules, aspirin, ER-DP, or placebo [ see ]; primary endpoints included stroke (fatal or nonfatal) and death from all causes. Clinical Studies (14) This 24-month, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study (ESPS2) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules with placebo, extended-release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone. The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization. Table 1 presents the annualized event rate for adverse events that occurred in 1%/year or more of patients treated with aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules where the incidence was also at least 1%/year greater than in those patients treated with placebo. There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole/aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety.

Subject-years is defined as cumulative number of days on treatment divided by 365.25. Note: ER-DP = extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg; ASA = aspirin 25 mg. The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. NOS = not otherwise specified. Discontinuation due to adverse events in ESPS2 was 25% for aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, 25% for extended-release dipyridamole, 19% for aspirin, and 21% for placebo (refer to Table 2).

Note:   ER-DP = extended-release dipyridamole 200 mg; ASA = aspirin 25 mg. The dosage regimen for all treatment groups is BID. Headache was most notable in the first month of treatment. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post-marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole.
