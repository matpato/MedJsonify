    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Ibuprofentablets and other treatment options before deciding to use Ibuprofen.Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent withindividual patient treatment goals (see ). WARNINGS Ibuprofen tablets are indicated for relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Ibuprofen tablets are indicated for relief of mild to moderate pain. Ibuprofen tablets are also indicated for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. Controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of Ibuprofen tablets in children have not been conducted.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivityto ibuprofen. Ibuprofen tablets should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin orother NSAIDs. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic-like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions, and PRECAUTIONS, Preexisting Asthma ). Ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery(see ). WARNINGS",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with Ibuprofen is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours [see WARNINGS ; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS ; Pregnancy].WARNINGS CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs.The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ibuprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see WARNINGS) . Status Post Coronary Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years to follow-up. Avoid the use of Ibuprofen in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Ibuprofen is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. Hypertension NSAIDs including Ibuprofen tablets, can lead to onset of new hypertensionor worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which maycontribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients takingthiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapieswhen taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen tablets, should beused with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure (BP)should be monitored closely during the initiation of NSAID treatmentand throughout the course of therapy. Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists’ Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trails demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of ibuprofen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] [See DRUG INTERACTIONS ]. Avoid the use of Ibuprofen tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If IBU tablets is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Gastrointestinal Effects - Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patientstreated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2 to 4% of patients treated for oneyear. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the riskof GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GIulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected.This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered. Renal Effects Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest riskof this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure,liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. Advanced Renal Disease No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of Ibuprofen tablets in patients with advanced renal disease.Therefore, treatment with Ibuprofen tablets is not recommended in these patients with advanced renal disease. If Ibuprofen tablet therapy must be initiated, close monitoring of the patients renal function is advisable. Anaphylactoid Reactions As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur inpatients without known prior exposure to ibuprofen tablets. Ibuprofen tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs (see Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoidreaction occurs. CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Preexisting Asthma) . Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of ibuprofen tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, reaction, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though reaction is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue Ibuprofen and evaluate the patient immediately. Pregnancy Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen, in pregnant women at about 30 week’s gestation and later. NSAIDs including Ibuprofen, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit Ibuprofen use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if Ibuprofen treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue Ibuprofen if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [see PRECAUTIONS ; Pregnancy]PRECAUTIONS General Ibuprofen tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids orto treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroidsmay lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolongedcorticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if adecision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of Ibuprofen tablets in reducing fever andinflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs indetecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions. Hepatic effects Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in upto 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen tablets. These laboratoryabnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or maybe transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal)have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trialswith NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions,including jaundice, fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepaticfailure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported. Apatient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, orwith abnormal liver test values, should be evaluated for evidence ofthe development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapywith IBU tablets. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liverdisease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g.,eosinophilia, reaction, etc.), Ibuprofen tablets should be discontinued. Hematological effects Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen tablets. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GIblood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis.Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen tablets,should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibitany signs or symptoms of anemia. In two postmarketing clinical studies the incidence of a decreasedhemoglobin level was greater than previously reported. Decrease inhemoglobin of 1 gram or more was observed in 17.1% of 193patients on 1,600 mg ibuprofen daily (osteoarthritis), and in 22.8% of189 patients taking 2,400 mg of ibuprofen daily (rheumatoid arthritis).Positive stool occult blood tests and elevated serum creatinine levelswere also observed in these studies. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolongbleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect onplatelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving Ibuprofen tablets who may be adversely affected byalterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disordersor patients receiving anticoagulants should be carefully monitored. Preexisting asthma Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The useof aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associatedwith severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity,including bronchospasm, between aspirin and NSAIDs hasbeen reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Ibuprofen tablets shouldnot be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivityand should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma. Ophthalmological effects. Blurred and/or diminished vision, scotomata, and/or changes incolor vision have been reported. If a patient develops such complaintswhile receiving Ibuprofen tablets, the drug should be discontinued, and thepatient should have an ophthalmologic examination which includescentral visual fields and color vision testing. Aseptic Meningitis Aseptic meningitis with fever and coma has been observed on rareoccasions in patients on ibuprofen therapy. Although it is probablymore likely to occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosusand related connective tissue diseases, it has been reported inpatients who do not have an underlying chronic disease. If signs orsymptoms of meningitis develop in a patient on Ibuprofen tablets, the possibilityof its being related to Ibuprofen tablets should be considered. Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the following information beforeinitiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course ofongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read theNSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed • Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events: Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately [see WARNINGS ]. • Ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely,serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which mayresult in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tractulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms,patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerationsand bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observingany indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia,melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of theimportance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects-Risk of Ulceration , Bleeding and Perforation) . • Ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effectssuch as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result inhospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions mayoccur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs andsymptoms of skin Reaction and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivitysuch as itching, and should ask for medical advice whenobserving any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should beadvised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of eaction and contact their physicians as soon as possible. • Serious Skin Reactions, including DRESS: Advise patients to stop taking ibuprofen tablets immediately if they develop any type of reaction or fever and to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see WARNINGS ]. • Heart Failure and Edema: Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur [see WARNINGS ]. • Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms ofhepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice,right upper quadrant tenderness and “flu-like” symptoms). If theseoccur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediatemedical therapy. • Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction(e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If theseoccur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergencyhelp (see . WARNINGS) • In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, Ibuprofen tablets should beavoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Fetal Toxicity Inform pregnant women to avoid use of Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs starting at 30 weeks gestation because of the risk of the premature closing of the fetal ductus arteriosus. If treatment with Ibuprofen is needed for a pregnant woman between about 20 to 30 weeks gestation, advise her that she may need to be monitored for oligohydramnios, if treatment continues for longer than 48 hours [see WARNINGS ; Fetal Toxicity, PRECAUTIONS ; Pregnancy]. Laboratory Tests Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur withoutwarning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs orsymptoms of GI bleeding. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs should have their CBC and chemistry profile checked periodically.If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renaldisease develop, systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia,reaction etc.), or abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, Ibuprofen tabletsshould be discontinued. Drug Interactions ACE-inhibitors: Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensiveeffect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given considerationin patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors. Aspirin : Pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated interference with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin when ibuprofen 400 mg, given three times daily, is administered with enteric‑ coated low-dose aspirin. The interaction exists even following a once-daily regimen of ibuprofen 400 mg, particularly when ibuprofen is dosed prior to aspirin. The interaction is alleviated if immediate-release low-dose aspirin is dosed at least 2 hours prior to a once‑ daily regimen of ibuprofen; however, this finding cannot be extended to enteric-coated low-dose aspirin [see Clinical Pharmacology/Pharmacodynamics ]. Because there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events due to the interference of ibuprofen with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, for patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardio protection who require analgesics, consider use of an NSAID that does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, or non-NSAID analgesics, where appropriate. When Ibuprofen tablets are administered with aspirin, its protein bindingis reduced, although the clearance of free Ibuprofen tablets is notaltered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however,as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ibuprofenand aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential forincreased adverse effects. Diuretics Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, haveshown that Ibuprofen tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect-offurosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has beenattributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitanttherapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closelyfor signs of renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS, Renal Effects), aswell as to assure diuretic efficacy. Lithium Ibuprofen produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and areduction in renal lithium clearance in a study of eleven normal volunteers.The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%and the renal clearance of lithium was decreased by 19% during thisperiod of concomitant drug administration.This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandinsynthesis by ibuprofen. Thus, when ibuprofen and lithium are administeredconcurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signsof lithium toxicity. (Read circulars for lithium preparation before useof such concurrent therapy.) Methotrexate NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexateaccumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they couldenhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate. Warfarin-type anticoagulants Several short-term controlled studies failed to show that Ibuprofentablets significantly affected prothrombin times or a variety of otherclotting factors when administered to individuals on coumarin-typeanticoagulants. However, because bleeding has been reported when Ibuprofen tablets and other NSAIDs have been administered to patients oncoumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautiouswhen administering Ibuprofen tablets to patients on anticoagulants. Theeffects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, suchthat the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleedinghigher than users of either drug alone. H-2 Antagonists In studies with human volunteers, co-administration of cimetidineor ranitidine with ibuprofen had no substantive effect on ibuprofenserum concentrations. Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of Ibuprofen use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid Ibuprofen use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy [see ]. WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus Use of NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Data fromobservational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAIDuse in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy areinconclusive. Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have notdemonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animalreproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. Basedon animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an importantrole in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, anddecidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandinsynthesis inhibitors such as ibuprofen, resulted in increased pre- and postimplantationloss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have animportant role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies,prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidneydevelopment when administered at clinically relevant doses. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including Ibuprofen, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see ). WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If Ibuprofen treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue Ibuprofen and follow up according to clinical practice (see ). WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity Data Human Data There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ibuprofen tablets should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: There are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ibuprofen tablets should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. Labor and Delivery In rat studies with NSAIDs, as with other drugs known to inhibitprostaglandin synthesis, an increased incidence of dystocia, delayedparturition, and decreased pup survival occurred. The effects of Ibuprofen tablets on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.Because many drugs are excreted in human-milk and because of thepotential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Ibuprofen tablets, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing ordiscontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drugto the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Ibuprofen tablets in pediatric patients havenot been established. Geriatric Use As with any NSAIDs, caution should be exercised in treating theelderly (65 years and older).",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring withIbuprofen tablets is gastrointestinal. In controlled clinical trials thepercentage of patients reporting one or more gastrointestinal complaintsranged from 4% to 16%. In controlled studies when Ibuprofen tablets were compared toaspirin and indomethacin in equally effective doses, the overall incidenceof gastrointestinal complaints was about half that seen in eitherthe aspirin- or indomethacin-treated patients.
