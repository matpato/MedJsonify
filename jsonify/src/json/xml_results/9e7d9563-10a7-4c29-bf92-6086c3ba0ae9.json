    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Icosapent ethyl capsules are indicated: as an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adult patients with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Limitations of Use: The effect of icosapent ethyl capsules on the risk for pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined . Icosapent ethyl capsules are an ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) indicated: as an adjunct to diet to reduce TG levels in adult patients with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. (1) Limitations of Use: The effect of icosapent ethyl capsules on the risk for pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia has not been determined. (1)",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Icosapent ethyl capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to icosapent ethyl or any of its components. Icosapent ethyl capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylactic reaction) to icosapent ethyl capsules or any of its components. (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Icosapent ethyl capsules were associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. (5.1) Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy: Icosapent ethyl capsules contain ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. (5.2) Bleeding: Icosapent ethyl capsules were associated with an increased risk of bleeding in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin. (5.3) 5.1 Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 subjects, adjudicated atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalization for 24 or more hours occurred in 127 (3%) patients treated with icosapent ethyl capsules compared to 84 (2%) patients receiving placebo [HR= 1.5 (95% CI 1.14, 1.98)]. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was greater in patients with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. 5.2 Potential for Allergic Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy Icosapent ethyl capsules contain ethyl esters of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), obtained from the oil of fish. It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and/or shellfish are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to icosapent ethyl capsules. Inform patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and/or shellfish about the potential for allergic reactions to icosapent ethyl capsules and advise them to discontinue icosapent ethyl capsules and seek medical attention if any reactions occur. 5.3 Bleeding Icosapent ethyl capsules are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8,179 patients, 482 (12%) patients receiving icosapent ethyl capsules experienced a bleeding event compared to 404 (10%) patients receiving placebo. Serious bleeding events occurred in 111 (3%) of patients on icosapent ethyl capsules vs. 85 (2%) of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of bleeding was greater in patients receiving concomitant antithrombotic medications, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Atrial      Fibrillation or Atrial Flutter [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Potential for Allergic      Reactions in Patients with Fish Allergy [see Warnings and Precautions      (5.2)] Bleeding [see Warnings      and Precautions (5.3)] Common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3% and ≥1% more frequent than placebo): musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation (6.1) Common adverse reactions in the hypertriglyceridemia trials (incidence ≥1% more frequent than placebo): arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3% on icosapent ethyl capsules and ≥1% more frequent than placebo) included musculoskeletal pain, peripheral edema, constipation, gout, and atrial fibrillation. Hypertriglyceridemia Trials In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with triglyceride levels between 200 and 2000 mg/dL treated for 12 weeks, adverse reactions reported with icosapent ethyl capsules at an incidence ≥1% more frequent than placebo based on pooled data included arthralgia and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of icosapent ethyl capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Diarrhea Blood triglycerides      increased Abdominal discomfort Pain in the extremities"
