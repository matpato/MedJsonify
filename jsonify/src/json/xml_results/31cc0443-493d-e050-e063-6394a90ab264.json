    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients who develop thrombosis. (5.2) Cancer Risks: Monitor women with a strong family history of breast cancer carefully. (5.3) Ectopic Pregnancy: Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman using medroxyprogesterone acetate becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain. (5.4) Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reactions: Provide emergency medical treatment. (5.5) Liver Function: Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate if jaundice or disturbances of liver function develop. (5.7) Carbohydrate Metabolism: Monitor diabetic patients carefully. (5.12) 5.1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion. It is unknown if use of medroxyprogesterone acetate by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with medroxyprogesterone acetate. After discontinuing medroxyprogesterone acetate in these adolescents, mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years (60 months) post-treatment in the sub-group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [see . Similarly, in adults, there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post-treatment Clinical Studies (14.3) ] [see . Clinical Studies (14.2) ] The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate is not recommended as a long-term (i.e. longer than 2 years) birth control method unless other options are considered inadequate. BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use medroxyprogesterone acetate long-term. In adolescents, interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity. Other birth control methods should be considered in the risk/benefit analysis for the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with osteoporosis risk factors. Medroxyprogesterone acetate can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis (e.g., metabolic bone disease, chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, anorexia nervosa, strong family history of osteoporosis or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids). 5.2 Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious thrombotic events in women using medroxyprogesterone acetate (150 mg). However, medroxyprogesterone acetate has not been causally associated with the induction of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders. Any patient who develops thrombosis while undergoing therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate should discontinue treatment unless she has no other acceptable options for birth control. Do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Do not re-administer if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer Women who have or have had a history of breast cancer should not use hormonal contraceptives, including medroxyprogesterone acetate, because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be monitored with particular care. Contraindications (4) ]. The results of five large case-control studies assessing the association between depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure 1. Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study. One recent US study 1 evaluated the recency and duration of use and found a statistically significantly increased risk of breast cancer in recent users (defined as last use within the past five years) who used DMPA for 12 months or longer; this is consistent with results of a previous study 2 . Figure 1: Risk estimates for breast cancer in DMPA users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates: Lee et al. (1987): age, parity, and socioeconomic status. Paul et al. (1989): age, parity, ethnic group, and year of interview. WHO (1991): age, center, and age at first live birth. Shapiro et al. (2000): age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, and any combined estrogen/progestogen oral contraceptive use. Li et al. (2012): age, year, BMI, duration of OC use, number of full-term pregnancies, family history of breast cancer, and history of screening mammography. Based on the published SEER-18 2011 incidence rate (age-adjusted to the 2,000 US Standard Population) of breast cancer for US women, all races, age 20 to 49 years, a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use medroxyprogesterone acetate from about 72 to about 144 cases per 100,000 women. Cervical Cancer A statistically nonsignificant increase in relative risk (RR) estimates of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer has been associated with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate in women who were first exposed before the age of 35 years (RR 1.22 to 1.28 and 95% CI 0.93 to 1.70). The overall, nonsignificant RR of invasive squamous-cell cervical cancer in women who ever used medroxyprogesterone acetate was estimated to be 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.29). No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed. Other Cancers Long-term case-controlled surveillance of users of medroxyprogesterone acetate found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer. figure 1 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy Be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using medroxyprogesterone acetate who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain. 5.5 Anaphylaxis and Anaphylactoid Reaction Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction have been reported with the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Institute emergency medical treatment if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.6 Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions have been reported with use of medroxyprogesterone acetate [see . Persistent injection site reactions may occur after administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate due to inadvertent subcutaneous administration or release of the drug into the subcutaneous space while removing the needle Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. 5.7 Liver Function Discontinue medroxyprogesterone acetate use if jaundice or acute or chronic disturbances of liver function develop. Do not resume use until markers of liver function return to normal and medroxyprogesterone acetate causation has been excluded. 5.8 Convulsions There have been a few reported cases of convulsions in patients who were treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Association with drug use or pre-existing conditions is not clear. 5.9 Depression Monitor patients who have a history of depression and do not re-administer medroxyprogesterone acetate if depression recurs. 5.10 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using medroxyprogesterone acetate experience disruption of menstrual bleeding patterns. Altered menstrual bleeding patterns include amenorrhea, irregular or unpredictable bleeding or spotting, prolonged spotting or bleeding, and heavy bleeding. Rule out the possibility of organic pathology if abnormal bleeding persists or is severe, and institute appropriate treatment. As women continue using medroxyprogesterone acetate, fewer experience irregular bleeding and more experience amenorrhea. In clinical studies of medroxyprogesterone acetate, by month 12 amenorrhea was reported by 55% of women, and by month 24, amenorrhea was reported by 68% of women using medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.11 Weight Gain Women tend to gain weight while on therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate. From an initial average body weight of 136 lb, women who completed 1 year of therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate gained an average of 5.4 lb. Women who completed 2 years of therapy gained an average of 8.1 lb. Women who completed 4 years gained an average of 13.8 lb. Women who completed 6 years gained an average of 16.5 lb. Two percent of women withdrew from a large-scale clinical trial because of excessive weight gain. 5.12 Carbohydrate Metabolism A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in some patients on medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment. Monitor diabetic patients carefully while receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate. 5.13 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including medroxyprogesterone acetate may cause some degree of fluid retention, monitor patients with conditions that might be influenced by this condition, such as epilepsy, migraine, asthma, and cardiac or renal dysfunction. 5.14 Return of Fertility Return to ovulation and fertility is likely to be delayed after stopping medroxyprogesterone acetate. In a large US study of women who discontinued use of medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant, data are available for 61% of them. Of the 188 women who discontinued the study to become pregnant, 114 became pregnant. Based on Life-Table analysis of these data, it is expected that 68% of women who do become pregnant may conceive within 12 months, 83% may conceive within 15 months, and 93% may conceive within 18 months from the last injection. The median time to conception for those who do conceive is 10 months following the last injection with a range of 4 to 31 months, and is unrelated to the duration of use. No data are available for 39% of the patients who discontinued medroxyprogesterone acetate to become pregnant and who were lost to follow-up or changed their mind. 5.15 Sexually Transmitted Infections Patients should be counseled that medroxyprogesterone acetate does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted infections. 5.16 Monitoring A woman who is taking hormonal contraceptive should have a yearly visit with her healthcare professional for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.17 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of medroxyprogesterone acetate may change the results of some laboratory tests, such as coagulation factors, lipids, glucose tolerance, and binding proteins [see .

In the two clinical trials with medroxyprogesterone acetate, over 3,900 women, who were treated for up to 7 years, reported the following adverse reactions, which may or may not be related to the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The population studied ranges in age from 15 to 51 years, of which 46% were White, 50% Non-White, and 4.9% Unknown race. The patients received 150 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate every 3-months (90 days). The median study duration was 13 months with a range of 1 to 84 months. Fifty-eight percent of patients remained in the study after 13 months and 34% after 24 months.
