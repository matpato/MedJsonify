Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available and monitor patients. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, urticaria and deaths due to anaphylaxis have been reported following intravenous administration of IC-GREEN [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6 )] IC-GREEN is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to indocyanine green [see Contraindications ( . Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions. 4 )] 5.2 Interference with Thyroid Radioactive Iodine Uptake Studies Because IC-GREEN contains sodium iodide, the iodine-binding capacity of thyroid tissue may be reduced for at least one week following administration [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )] The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of IC-GREEN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, urticaria The most common adverse reactions reported are anaphylaxis and urticaria.
