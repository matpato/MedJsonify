    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE TEPYLUTE is an alkylating drug indicated for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary. ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Adenocarcinoma of the Breast or Ovary TEPYLUTE is indicated for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or ovary.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS TEPYLUTE is contraindicated in: Patients with severe hypersensitivity to thiotepa [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Concomitant use with live or attenuated vaccines [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity to the active substance. ( 4 ) Concomitant use with live or attenuated vaccines. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cutaneous Toxicity: Cleanse skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after the last dose of TEPYLUTE. ( 5.3 ) Polyethylene Glycol 400 Toxicity: Take into consideration the PEG 400 load from concomitant medications. ( 5.8 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression For patients receiving TEPYLUTE for treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast or adenocarcinoma of the ovary, if the bone marrow has been compromised by prior irradiation or chemotherapy, or is recovering from chemotherapy, the risk of severe myelosuppression with TEPYLUTE may be increased. Perform periodic complete blood counts during the course of treatment with TEPYLUTE. Provide supportive care for infections, bleeding, and symptomatic anemia [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred following administration of thiotepa. If anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, discontinue treatment with TEPYLUTE, initiate appropriate therapy, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications ( and 4 ) Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.3 Cutaneous Toxicity TEPYLUTE and/or its active metabolites may be excreted in part via skin in patients receiving high-dose therapy. Treatment with TEPYLUTE may cause skin discoloration, pruritus, blistering, desquamation, and peeling that may be more severe in the groin, axillae, skin folds, in the neck area, and under dressings. Instruct patients to shower or bathe with water at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of TEPYLUTE. Change occlusive dressing and clean the covered skin at least twice daily through 48 hours after administration of TEPYLUTE. Change bed sheets daily during treatment. Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to TEPYLUTE may occur. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water in case TEPYLUTE solution contacts the skin. Flush mucous membranes in case of TEPYLUTE contact with mucous membranes. 5.4 Concomitant Use of Live and Attenuated Vaccines Do not administer live or attenuated viral or bacterial vaccines to a patient treated with TEPYLUTE until the immunosuppressive effects have resolved. 5.5 Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease Monitor by physical examination, serum transaminases and bilirubin, and provide supportive care to patients who develop hepatic veno-occlusive disease. 5.6 Central Nervous System Toxicity Fatal encephalopathy has occurred in patients treated with high doses of thiotepa. Other central nervous system toxicities, such as headache, apathy, psychomotor retardation, disorientation, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations, drowsiness, somnolence, seizures, coma, inappropriate behavior and forgetfulness have been reported to occur in a dose-dependent manner during or shortly after administration of high-dose thiotepa. Do not exceed the recommended dose of TEPYLUTE. If severe or life-threatening central nervous system toxicity occurs, discontinue administration of TEPYLUTE and provide supportive care. 5.7 Carcinogenicity Like many alkylating agents, thiotepa has been reported to be carcinogenic when administered to laboratory animals [see Nonclinical Toxicity ( . Carcinogenicity is shown most clearly in studies using mice, but there is some evidence of carcinogenicity in man. There is an increased risk of a secondary malignancy with use of TEPYLUTE. 13.1) ] 5.8 Polyethylene Glycol 400 Toxicity TEPYLUTE contains a high concentration of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400. Based on findings in animals, administration of high amounts of PEG 400 may cause damage to the kidneys and liver at dosages higher than recommended. When prescribing TEPYLUTE, take into consideration the PEG 400 load from concomitant medications. 5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals, TEPYLUTE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of TEPYLUTE in pregnant women. Thiotepa given by the intraperitoneal (IP) route was teratogenic in mice at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg (3.2 mg/m 2 ), approximately 8-fold less than the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose (0.8 mg/kg, 27 mg/m 2 ), based on body-surface area. Thiotepa given by the IP route was teratogenic in rats at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg (21 mg/m 2 ), approximately equal to the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, based on body-surface area. Thiotepa was lethal to rabbit fetuses at a dose of 3 mg/kg (41 mg/m 2 ), approximately two times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose based on body-surface area. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during and after treatment with TEPYLUTE for 6 months after therapy. Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with TEPYLUTE for 1 year after therapy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ] .",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the label: Myelosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Cutaneous Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Central Nervous System Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Carcinogenicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) are neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, elevated bilirubin, mucositis, cytomegalovirus infection, hemorrhage, diarrhea, hematuria and rash.
