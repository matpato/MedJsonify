In three double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trials (Trial 1, and Trial 2 and Trial 3, which were similarly designed to Trial 1), 1596 adult and pediatric subjects were treated with ZELSUVMI or vehicle gel topically once daily for up to 12 weeks [see ]. In these trials 3% of subjects were less than 2 years of age, and 96% of subjects were 2 to 17 years of age. The trial population included 51% male, 88% White, 6% Black, and 6% Other; for ethnicity, 21% of subjects identified as Hispanic/Latino, 78% as non-Hispanic/Latino, and 1% were not reported. Adverse reactions reported by ≥1% of subjects and more frequently than vehicle-treated subjects are listed in Table 1.
