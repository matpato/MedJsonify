    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE XYOSTED (testosterone enanthate) injection is an androgen indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired): testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, orchiectomy, Klinefelter's syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage from alcohol or heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone concentrations and gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH]) above the normal range. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired): gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. These men have low testosterone serum concentrations but have gonadotropins in the normal or low range. Limitations of Use: Safety and efficacy of XYOSTED in men with “age-related hypogonadism” has not been established. Safety and efficacy of XYOSTED in males less than 18 years old have not been established [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] XYOSTED (testosterone enanthate) injection is an androgen indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone ( 1 ). Limitations of Use: Safety and efficacy of XYOSTED in men with “age-related hypogonadism” has not been established ( 1 ). Safety and efficacy of XYOSTED in males less than 18 years old have not been established ( 1 , 8.4 ).",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS XYOSTED is contraindicated in: Men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] Women who are pregnant. Testosterone can cause virilization of the female fetus when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] Men with known hypersensitivity to XYOSTED or any of its ingredients (testosterone enanthate and sesame oil). Men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate ( 4 , 5.3 ). Women who are pregnant ( 4 , 8.1 ). Testosterone may cause fetal harm ( 4 , 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.2 ). Known hypersensitivity to XYOSTED or its ingredients ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Polycythemia: Monitor hematocrit approximately every 3 months to detect increased red blood cell mass and polycythemia ( 5.1 ). Venous thromboembolism (VTE): VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE ( 5.2 ). Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer: Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms of BPH ( 5.3 ). Blood Pressure Increases: Testosterone can increase blood pressure, which can increase cardiovascular risk over time. Measure blood pressure periodically. Not recommended for use in men with uncontrolled hypertension ( 5.4 ). Abuse of Testosterone: Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids ( 5.5 ). Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis: Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia ( 5.7 ). Edema: Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease ( 5.9 ). Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors ( 5.11 ). Monitor prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and lipid concentrations periodically ( 5.3 , 5.12 ). Depression and suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have occurred during clinical trials in patients treated with XYOSTED ( 5.15 ). 5.1 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit reflective of increases in red blood cell mass may require discontinuation of XYOSTED. Check that hematocrit is not elevated prior to initiating XYOSTED. Evaluate hematocrit approximately every 3 months while the patient is on XYOSTED. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop XYOSTED until the hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. If XYOSTED is restarted and again causes hematocrit to become elevated, stop XYOSTED permanently. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.2 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as XYOSTED. In the Testosterone Replacement therapy for Assessment of long-term Vascular Events and efficacy ResponSE\nin hypogonadal men (TRAVERSE) Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cardiovascular (CV) outcomes study, compared to placebo, topical testosterone gel was associated with a higher risk of VTE (1.7% vs 1.2%) which included DVT (0.6% vs 0.5%) and PE (0.9% vs 0.5%) [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with XYOSTED and initiate appropriate workup and management. 5.3 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk of worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.4 Blood Pressure Increases XYOSTED can increase blood pressure. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) demonstrated XYOSTED increased systolic/diastolic BP by an average of 3.9/1.5 mmHg from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( In patients with hypertension on antihypertensive therapy, XYOSTED increased the mean systolic/diastolic BP by 3.9/1.3 mm Hg from baseline. 6.1 )]. The CV risk associated with topical testosterone gel was evaluated in TRAVERSE, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, CV outcomes study in men with a history of CV disease or multiple CV risk factors. In TRAVERSE, topical testosterone gel increased mean systolic blood pressure by 1.8 mmHg from baseline. However, the incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] and non-fatal stroke, were similar between treatment groups (7% for topical testosterone gel vs 7.3% for placebo) [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Monitor blood pressure periodically in men using XYOSTED, especially men with hypertension. XYOSTED is not recommended for use in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.5 Abuse of Testosterone and Monitoring of Serum Testosterone Concentrations Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids.  Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( . 9 )] If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range.  However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids.  Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events. 5.6 Not for Use in Women Due to lack of controlled studies in women and potential virilizing effects, XYOSTED is not indicated for use in women [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.2 )] 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including XYOSTED, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use XYOSTED. 8.3 )] 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g., methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate, which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods, has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. XYOSTED is not known to produce these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., jaundice). If these occur, promptly discontinue XYOSTED while the cause is evaluated. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including XYOSTED, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and may persist in patients being treated for hypogonadism. 5.11 Sleep Apnea Treatment with testosterone products including XYOSTED may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung disease. 5.12 Lipid Changes Changes in the serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment of lipid lowering drugs or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including XYOSTED, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Monitor serum calcium concentrations regularly during treatment with XYOSTED in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including XYOSTED, may decrease concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Risk of Depression and Suicide Depression and suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have occurred during clinical trials in patients treated with XYOSTED. Advise patients and caregivers to seek medical attention for manifestations of suicidal ideation or behavior, new onset or worsening depression, anxiety, or other mood changes.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>5%) were: hematocrit increased, hypertension, PSA increased, injection site bruising, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Antares at 1-844-XYOSTED (1-844-996-7833) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of XYOSTED was evaluated in 2 clinical studies in a total of 283 men who received weekly subcutaneous doses for up to one year. All patients were started on 75 mg weekly, then the dose was titrated to 50 mg or 100 mg weekly, as needed, to achieve pre-dose total testosterone concentrations of ≥350 ng/dL and <650 ng/dL. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions (≥2%) reported in a one-year study with XYOSTED. Table 1. Number (%) of Patients with Adverse Reactions ≥2% in a 1 Year study with XYOSTED Preferred Term Overall (N=150) n (%) Hematocrit increased 21 (14.0) Hypertension 19 (12.7) Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) increased 18 (12.0) Injection site bruising 10 (6.7) Headache 8 (5.3) Back pain 5 (3.3) Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 5 (3.3) Injection site hemorrhage 5 (3.3) Acne 4 (2.7) Blood testosterone increased 4 (2.7) Cough 4 (2.7) Edema peripheral 4 (2.7) Injection site erythema 4 (2.7) Prostatitis 4 (2.7) Urinary tract infection 4 (2.7) Abdominal pain 3 (2.0) Arthralgia 3 (2.0) Fatigue 3 (2.0) Hematuria 3 (2.0) Polycythemia 3 (2.0) Sleep apnea syndrome 3 (2.0) Note: Includes events that started on or after the first dosing, or existed prior to the first dose and worsened in severity or relatedness after dosing. Percentage was calculated using the number of patients in the column heading as the denominator. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions (≥2%) reported in a 6-month study with XYOSTED. Table 2.

Percentage was calculated using the number of patients in the column heading as the denominator. BP Increases In the 6-month clinical study, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was conducted in 133 patients, 113 of whom completed the study. ABPM was conducted at 3 distinct 24-hour time periods: at Baseline and following 6 and 12 weeks of XYOSTED therapy. A total of 62 patients had acceptable ABPM recordings at baseline and Week 12. In that group, the mean change in systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to Week 12 was + 3.9 mmHg (95% CI 1.4-6.4) and + 1.5 mmHg (95% CI 0.4-2.6), respectively. In patients with a history of hypertension who were receiving antihypertensive therapy, the mean ABPM systolic and diastolic BP increased by +3.9 mmHg [95% CI 0.19-7.7] and +1.3 mmHg [95% CI -0.37-3.0], respectively [n=33]). In patients with no history of hypertension, the mean ABPM systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased by +4.1 mmHg [95% CI 0.43-7.8] and +1.9 mmHg [95% CI 0.055-3.7], respectively [n=28]). 10% of XYOSTED-treated patients were either started on antihypertensive medications or required changes to their antihypertensive medication regimen during the 1-year study. A total of 3 patients were reported to have an adverse reaction of hypertension (2 patients with hypertension and 1 patient with worsening hypertension), and 1 was reported to have an adverse reaction of increased blood pressure. Increases in Hematocrit Increases in hematocrit to ≥55% were reported for 12 of the 283 patients in the 2 clinical studies, representing 4.2% of patients who received XYOSTED for up to one year. While the studies did not pre-define clinical adverse events related to increased hematocrit, polycythemia was reported as a medically significant adverse event in the investigator’s clinical judgment in 1.8% of treated patients. XYOSTED dosing resulted in mean hemoglobin increases of 1.0 ± 1.1 g/dL at 6 months and 1.1 ± 1.4 g/dL at 1 year and mean hematocrit increases of 3.8 ± 3.4% at 6 months and 5.4 ± 3.4% at 1 year. Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions, including injection site bruising, injection site hemorrhage, injection site erythema and injection site induration were reported in 36 of the 283 patients in the 2 clinical studies, representing 12.7% of patients who received XYOSTED for up to one year. No patients discontinued XYOSTED because of injection site reactions. Depression and Suicide Attempts Depression requiring discontinuation was reported in 2 of the 283 patients in the two clinical studies and suicide attempts (one complete and one incomplete) were reported in 2 additional patients, comprising a total of 4 patients, representing 1.4% of patients who received XYOSTED for up to one year. Increases in Serum PSA Increases in serum PSA concentrations, defined as an increase from baseline of at least 1.4 ng/mL, or PSA greater than 4 ng/mL, led to discontinuation in 4.6% of the 283 patients in the 2 clinical studies. Cardiovascular Outcomes TRAVERSE was a randomized, double-blind, cardiovascular outcomes study to assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of topical testosterone gel compared to placebo in 5198 hypogonadal men aged 45 to 80 years with a history of CV disease or with multiple CV risk factors. The primary outcome was the incidence of the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), consisting of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke. The mean duration of therapy was approximately 22 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 33 months. Approximately 61% of all patients discontinued topical testosterone gel or placebo therapy. The mean patient age (±SD) was 63.3 (7.9) years. Approximately 80% of patients were White, 17% were Black, and 3% were of other races or ethnic groups. Approximately 69%, 84%, and 93% had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, respectively. Approximately 55% had preexisting cardiovascular disease. The mean serum testosterone concentration at baseline in patients receiving topical testosterone gel was 220.4 ng/dL (n=2129). The mean serum testosterone concentrations at 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, and 48 months in patients receiving topical testosterone gel were 440.5 ng/dL (n=1683), 420.9 ng/dl (n=1125), 428.7 ng/dL (n=731), and 365.2 ng/dL (n=220), respectively. For patients treated with topical testosterone gel, the incidence of MACE was 7.0% (n=182 events) and for those receiving placebo, the incidence of MACE was 7.3% (n=190 events). The study demonstrated noninferiority of topical testosterone gel versus placebo because the upper bound of 95% CI was less than the prespecified risk margin, of 1.5 for MACE (Hazard Ratio 0.96 [95% CI: 0.78, 1.17]). Additional Adverse Reactions Reported in TRAVERSE Additional adverse reactions reported in TRAVERSE at an incidence rate >2% in either treatment group and greater in topical testosterone gel versus placebo included: nonfatal arrythmias warranting intervention (5.2% vs 3.3%), atrial fibrillation (3.5% vs 2.4%), acute kidney injury (2.3% vs 1.5%) and bone fracture (3.5% vs 2.5%). For the adverse reaction of bone fracture, each event was adjudicated by clinical review."
