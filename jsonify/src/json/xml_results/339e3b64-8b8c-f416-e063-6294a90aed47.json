    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Spironolactone tablets are an aldosterone antagonist indicated for: The treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure. ( 1.1 ) Use as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.2 ) The management of edema in adult patients who are cirrhotic when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restrictions and in the setting of nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response. ( 1.3 ) Treatment of primary hyperaldosternism for: ( 1.4 ) Short-term preoperative treatment. Long-term maintenance for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery and patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. 1.1 Heart Failure Spironolactone tablets are indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure. Spironolactone tablets are usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies. 1.2 Hypertension Spironolactone tablets are indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. 1.3 Edema Associated with Hepatic Cirrhosis or Nephrotic Syndrome Spironolactone tablets are indicated for the management of edema in the following settings: Cirrhosis of the liver when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restriction. Nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response. Because it increases serum potassium, spironolactone tablets may be useful for treating edema when administration of other diuretics has caused hypokalemia. 1.4 Primary Hyperaldosteronism Spironolactone tablets are indicated in the following settings: Short-term preoperative treatment of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery. Long-term maintenance therapy for patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism).",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Spironolactone is contraindicated in the patients with: Hyperkalemia Addison’s disease Concomitant use of eplerenone Spironolactone is contraindicated in patients with ( 4 ): Hyperkalemia Addison’s disease Concomitant use of eplerenone",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperkalemia: Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation and regularly thereafter. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension and Worsening Renal Function: Monitor volume status and renal function periodically. ( 5.2 ) Electrolyte and Metabolic Abnormalities: Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid and blood glucose periodically. ( 5.3 ) Gynecomastia: Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hyperkalemia Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia. This risk is increased by impaired renal function or concomitant potassium supplementation, potassium-containing salt substitutes or drugs that increase potassium, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Monitor serum potassium within 1 week of initiation or titration of spironolactone and regularly thereafter. More frequent monitoring may be needed when spironolactone is given with other drugs that cause hyperkalemia or in patients with impaired renal function. If hyperkalemia occurs, decrease the dose or discontinue spironolactone and treat hyperkalemia. 5.2 Hypotension and Worsening Renal Function Excessive diuresis may cause symptomatic dehydration, hypotension and worsening renal function, particularly in salt-depleted patients or those taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Worsening of renal function can also occur with concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs). Monitor volume status and renal function periodically. 5.3 Electrolyte and Metabolic Abnormalities In addition to causing hyperkalemia, spironolactone can cause hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hyperglycemia. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia can occur and rarely gout is precipitated. Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid and blood glucose periodically. 5.4 Gynecomastia Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia. In a Randomized Spironolactone Evaluation Study, patients with heart failure treated with a mean dose of 26 mg of spironolactone once daily, about 9% of the male subjects developed gynecomastia. The risk of gynecomastia increases in a dose-dependent manner with an onset that varies widely from 1 to 2 months to over a year. Gynecomastia is usually reversible.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Hypotension and Worsening Renal Function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Electrolyte and Metabolic Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Gynecomastia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Impaired neurological function/coma in patients with hepatic impairment, cirrhosis and ascites [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. The following adverse reactions associated with the use of spironolactone were identified in clinical trials or post-marketing reports. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency, reliably, or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Digestive: Gastric bleeding, ulceration, gastritis, diarrhea and cramping, nausea, vomiting. Reproductive: Decreased libido, inability to achieve or maintain erection, irregular menses or amenorrhea, postmenopausal bleeding, breast and nipple pain. Hematologic: Leukopenia (including agranulocytosis), thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity: Fever, urticaria, maculopapular or erythematous cutaneous eruptions, anaphylactic reactions, vasculitis. Metabolism: Hyperkalemia, electrolyte disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions ( , hyponatremia, hypovolemia. 5.1 , 5.3 )] Musculoskeletal: Leg cramps. Nervous system/psychiatric: Lethargy, mental confusion, ataxia, dizziness, headache, drowsiness. Liver/biliary: A very few cases of mixed cholestatic/hepatocellular toxicity, with one reported fatality, have been reported with spironolactone administration. Renal: Renal dysfunction (including renal failure). Skin: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), alopecia, pruritus. The most common adverse reaction with  spironolactone treatment is gynecomastia.
