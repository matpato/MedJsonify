    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE FLAREX (fluorometholone acetate ophthalmic suspension) 0.1% is indicated for use in the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the eye.",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Contraindicated in acute superficial herpes simplex keratitis, vaccinia, varicella, and most other viral diseases of cornea and conjunctiva; mycobacterial infection of the eye; fungal diseases; acute purulent untreated infections, which like other diseases caused by microorganisms, may be masked or enhanced by the presence of the steroid; and in those persons who have known hypersensitivity to any component of this preparation.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE. NOT FOR INJECTION. Use in the treatment of herpes simplex infection requires great caution. Prolonged use may result in glaucoma, damage to the optic nerve, defect in visual acuity and visual field, cataract formation and/or may aid in the establishment of secondary ocular infections from pathogens due to suppression of host response. Acute purulent infections of the eye may be masked or exacerbated by presence of steroid medication. Topical ophthalmic corticosteroids may slow corneal wound healing. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforation has been known to occur with chronic use of topical steroids. If these products are used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure (IOP) should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients.PRECAUTIONS General Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Prescription Guidelines The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated. Not more than one bottle should be prescribed initially, and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation. Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. The preservative in FLAREX ® (fluorometholone acetate ophthalmic suspension) 0.1%, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed during instillation of FLAREX (fluorometholone acetate ophthalmic suspension) 0.1% but may be reinserted 15 minutes after instillation. Patients should be advised that their vision may be temporarily blurred following dosing with FLAREX ® (fluorometholone acetate ophthalmic suspension) 0.1%. Care should be exercised in operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted in animals or in humans to evaluate the possibility of these effects with fluorometholone. Pregnancy Fluorometholone has been shown to be embryocidal and teratogenic in rabbits when administered at low multiples of the human ocular dose. Fluorometholone was applied ocularly to rabbits daily on days 6-18 of gestation, and dose-related fetal loss and fetal abnormalities including cleft palate, deformed rib cage, anomalous limbs and neural abnormalities such as encephalocele, craniorachischisis, and spina bifida were observed. There are no adequate and well controlled studies of fluorometholone in pregnant women, and it is not known whether fluorometholone can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fluorometholone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when FLAREX (fluorometholone acetate ophthalmic suspension) 0.1%, is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Glaucoma with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, cataract formation, secondary ocular infection following suppression of host response, and perforation of the globe may occur. Postmarketing Experience The following reaction has been identified during post-marketing use of FLAREX (fluorometholone acetate ophthalmic suspension) 0.1% in clinical practice. Because reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reaction, which has been chosen for inclusion due to either its seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to FLAREX, or a combination of these factors, includes: dysgeusia. ® The following rare adverse reactions have been reported: Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression may occur after very frequent use of topical ophthalmic corticosteroids, particularly in very young children."
