    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Miglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor indicated as monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with mild/moderate type 1 Gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option ( 1.1 ). 1.1 Type 1 Gaucher Disease Miglustat is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option (e.g. due to allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor venous access).",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None. None ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Peripheral neuropathy: Perform baseline and follow-up neurological evaluations at 6-month intervals in all patients ( 5.1 ). Tremor : Reduce dose to ameliorate tremor or discontinue treatment if tremor does not resolve within days of dose reduction ( 5.2 ). Diarrhea and weight loss : Evaluate for underlying gastrointestinal disease in patients who do not respond to usual interventions (e.g. diet modification) ( 5.3 ). Reductions in Platelet Count : Mild reductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in some patients. Monitoring of platelet counts is recommended ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy In clinical trials, cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in 3% of Gaucher's patients treated with miglustat. All patients receiving miglustat treatment should undergo baseline and repeat neurological evaluations at approximately 6-month intervals. Patients who develop symptoms of peripheral neuropathy such as pain, weakness, numbness and tingling should have a careful re-assessment of the risk/benefit of miglustat therapy, and cessation of treatment may be considered. 5.2 Tremor Approximately 30% of patients have reported tremor or exacerbation of existing tremor on treatment. These tremors were described as an exaggerated physiological tremor of the hands. Tremor usually began within the first month of therapy and in many cases resolved between 1 to 3 months during treatment. Reduce dose to ameliorate tremor or discontinue treatment if tremor does not resolve within days of dose reduction. 5.3 Diarrhea and Weight Loss Diarrhea and weight loss were common in clinical studies of patients treated with miglustat, occurring in approximately 85% and up to 65% of treated patients, respectively. Diarrhea appears to be the result of the inhibitory activity of miglustat on intestinal disaccharidases such as sucrase-isomaltase in the gastrointestinal tract leading to reduced absorption of dietary disaccharides in the small intestine, with a resultant osmotic diarrhea. It is unclear if weight loss results from the diarrhea and associated gastrointestinal complaints, a decrease in food intake, or a combination of these or other factors. The incidence of weight loss was most evident in the first 12 months of treatment. Diarrhea decreased over time with continued miglustat treatment, and may respond to individualized diet modification (e.g., reduction of sucrose, lactose and other carbohydrate intake), to taking miglustat capsules between meals, and/or to anti-diarrheal medications, most commonly loperamide. Patients may be instructed to avoid high carbohydrate content foods during treatment with miglustat if they present with diarrhea. Patients with persistent gastrointestinal events that continue during treatment with miglustat, and who do not respond to usual interventions (e.g. diet modification), should be evaluated to determine whether significant underlying gastrointestinal disease is present. The safety of treatment with miglustat has not been evaluated in patients with significant gastrointestinal disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and continued treatment of these patients with miglustat should occur only after consideration of the risks and benefits of continued treatment. 5.4 Reductions in Platelet Count In clinical trials evaluating the use of miglustat for treatment of indications other than type 1 Gaucher disease, mild reductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in some patients; approximately 40% of patients in this trial had low platelet counts (defined as below 150×10 9 /L) before starting treatment with miglustat. Monitoring of platelet counts is recommended in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. Mild reductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who were switched from enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to miglustat.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Peripheral Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Tremor [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Diarrhea and Weight Loss [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Reductions in Platelet Count [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) are: diarrhea, weight loss, stomach pain, gas, nausea and vomiting headache including migraine, tremor, leg cramps, dizziness, weakness, vision problems, thrombocytopenia, muscle cramps, back pain, constipation, dry mouth, heaviness in arms and legs, memory loss, unsteady walking, anorexia, indigestion, paresthesia, stomach bloating, stomach pain not related to food, and menstrual changes ( 6.1 ).

The data described below reflect exposure of 80 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease in two open-label, uncontrolled, monotherapy trials, one open-label, active-controlled trial, and two extensions, who received miglustat capsules at doses ranging from 50 mg to 200 mg three times daily. Patients were aged 18 to 69 years at first treatment. The population was evenly distributed by gender. The most common serious adverse reaction reported with miglustat capsule treatment in clinical trials was peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with miglustat capsules (occurring in ≥5%) that were considered related to miglustat are shown in Tables 1 and 2 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )]. The most common adverse reactions requiring intervention were diarrhea and tremor [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )]. In two open-label, uncontrolled monotherapy trials, adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients were treated with miglustat capsules at a starting dose of 100 mg three times daily (dose range 100 to 200 mg three times daily) for up to 12 months in 28 patients [Study 1], or at a dose of 50 mg three times daily for up to 6 months in 18 patients [Study 2]. Table 1 below lists adverse reactions that occurred during the trials in ≥5% of patients.
