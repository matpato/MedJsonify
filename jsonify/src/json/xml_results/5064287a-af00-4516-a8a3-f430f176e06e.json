    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pressor Effects with Concomitant Use with Oxytocic Drugs: Pressor effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines is potentiated ( 5.1 ) Tachyphylaxis and Tolerance: Repeated administration of EMERPHED and EMERPHED-PFS may cause tachyphylaxis ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Pressor Effect with Concomitant Oxytocic Drugs Serious postpartum hypertension has been described in patients who received both a vasopressor (i.e., methoxamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine) and an oxytocic (i.e., methylergonovine, ergonovine) [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. Some of these patients experienced a stroke. Carefully monitor the blood pressure of individuals who have received both EMERPHED and EMERPHED-PFS and an oxytocic. 7 ) 5.2 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis Data indicate that repeated administration of ephedrine can result in tachyphylaxis. Be aware of this possibility when treating anesthesia-induced hypotension with EMERPHED and EMERPHED-PFS and be prepared with an alternative pressor to mitigate unacceptable responsiveness. 5.3 Risk of Hypertension When Used Prophylactically When used to prevent hypotension, ephedrine has been associated with an increased incidence of hypertension compared with when ephedrine is used to treat hypotension.",
    "adverseReactions": "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of ephedrine sulfate were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting Cardiac disorders: Tachycardia, palpitations (thumping heart), reactive hypertension, bradycardia, ventricular ectopics, R-R variability Nervous system disorders: Dizziness Psychiatric disorders: Restlessness Most common adverse reactions during treatment : nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia.
