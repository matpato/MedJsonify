    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DUPIXENT is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to dupilumab or any excipients of DUPIXENT [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Known hypersensitivity to dupilumab or any excipients in DUPIXENT. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, serum sickness, angioedema, urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum, and erythema multiforme have occurred. Discontinue DUPIXENT in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.1 ) Conjunctivitis and Keratitis: Advise patients to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare provider. Consider ophthalmological examination, as appropriate. ( 5.2 ) Eosinophilic Conditions: Be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, kidney injury and/or neuropathy, especially upon reduction of oral corticosteroids. ( 5.3 ) Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage: Do not discontinue systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of DUPIXENT. Decrease steroids gradually, if appropriate. ( 5.5 ) Psoriasis: Advise patients to report new-onset psoriasis symptoms to their healthcare provider. If symptoms persist or worsen, consider dermatologic evaluation and/or discontinuation of DUPIXENT. ( 5.7 ) Arthralgia and Psoriatic Arthritis: Advise patients to report new onset joint symptoms to their healthcare provider. If symptoms persist or worsen, consider rheumatological evaluation and/or discontinuation of DUPIXENT. ( 5.8 ) Parasitic (Helminth) Infections: Treat pre-existing helminth infections before initiating DUPIXENT. If patients become infected while receiving DUPIXENT and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue DUPIXENT until the infection resolves. ( 5.9) Vaccinations: Avoid use of live vaccines. ( 5.10 ) 5.1\tHypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions, angioedema, generalized urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme have been reported. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue DUPIXENT [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.6) ] 5.2\tConjunctivitis and Keratitis Conjunctivitis and keratitis adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Conjunctivitis and keratitis occurred more frequently in AD subjects who received DUPIXENT compared to those who received placebo. Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported eye disorder. Most subjects with conjunctivitis or keratitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Among subjects with asthma, the frequencies of conjunctivitis and keratitis were similar between DUPIXENT and placebo [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] In adult subjects with CRSwNP, the frequency of conjunctivitis was 2% in the DUPIXENT group compared to 1% in the placebo group in the 24-week safety pool; these subjects recovered. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the CRSwNP development program [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Among subjects with EoE, there were no reports of conjunctivitis and keratitis in the DUPIXENT group in placebo-controlled trials [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] In subjects with PN, the frequency of conjunctivitis was 4% in the DUPIXENT group compared to 1% in the placebo group; these subjects recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the PN development program [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Among subjects with COPD, the frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was 1.4% and 0.1% in the DUPIXENT group and 1% and 0% in the placebo group, respectively [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] In subjects with CSU, the frequency of conjunctivitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the CSU development program [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Conjunctivitis and keratitis adverse events have also been reported with DUPIXENT in postmarketing settings, predominantly in AD patients. Some patients reported visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision) associated with conjunctivitis or keratitis. Advise patients or their caregivers to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare provider. Consider ophthalmological examination for patients who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following standard treatment or signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis, as appropriate [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3\tEosinophilic Conditions Patients being treated for asthma may present with clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). These events may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Healthcare providers should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, kidney injury, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Cases of eosinophilic pneumonia were reported in adults who participated in the asthma development program. Cases of EGPA have been reported with DUPIXENT in adults who participated in the asthma development program as well as in adults with co-morbid asthma in the CRSwNP development program. Advise patients to report signs of eosinophilic pneumonia and EGPA to their healthcare provider. Consider withholding DUPIXENT if eosinophilic pneumonia or EGPA are suspected. 5.4\tAcute Symptoms of Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or Acute Deteriorating Disease DUPIXENT should not be used to treat acute symptoms or acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD. Do not use DUPIXENT to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma or COPD remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with DUPIXENT. 5.5\tRisk Associated with Abrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage Do not discontinue systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with DUPIXENT. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy. 5.6\tPatients with Co-morbid Asthma Advise patients with co-morbid asthma not to adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their physicians. 5.7 Psoriasis Cases of new-onset psoriasis have been reported with the use of DUPIXENT for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and asthma, including in patients without a family history of psoriasis. In postmarketing reports, onset of psoriasis varied from weeks to months after the first dose of DUPIXENT and resulted in partial or complete resolution of psoriasis with discontinuation of dupilumab, with or without use of supplemental treatment for psoriasis (topical or systemic). Those who continued on dupilumab received supplemental treatment for psoriasis to improve associated symptoms. Advise patients to report new-onset psoriasis symptoms to their healthcare provider. If symptoms persist or worsen, consider dermatologic evaluation and/or discontinuation of DUPIXENT. 5.8\tArthralgia and Psoriatic Arthritis Arthralgia has been reported with the use of DUPIXENT with some patients reporting gait disturbances or decreased mobility associated with joint symptoms; some cases resulted in hospitalization [see . In postmarketing reports, onset of arthralgia was variable, ranging from days to months after the first dose of DUPIXENT. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Cases of new-onset psoriatic arthritis requiring systemic treatment have been reported with the use of DUPIXENT. Some patients' symptoms resolved while continuing treatment with DUPIXENT, and other patients recovered or were recovering following discontinuation of DUPIXENT. Advise patients to report new onset or worsening joint symptoms to their healthcare provider. If symptoms persist or worsen, consider rheumatological evaluation and/or discontinuation of DUPIXENT. 5.9\tParasitic (Helminth) Infections Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. It is unknown if DUPIXENT will influence the immune response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with DUPIXENT. If patients become infected while receiving treatment with DUPIXENT and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue treatment with DUPIXENT until the infection resolves. Adverse reactions of helminth infections (5 cases of enterobiasis and 1 case of ascariasis) were reported in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years old who participated in the pediatric asthma development program [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.10\tVaccinations Consider completing all age-appropriate vaccinations as recommended by current immunization guidelines prior to initiating treatment with DUPIXENT. Avoid use of live vaccines during treatment with DUPIXENT. It is unknown if administration of live vaccines during DUPIXENT treatment will impact the safety or effectiveness of these vaccines. Limited data are available regarding coadministration of DUPIXENT with non-live vaccines [see . Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]",

Adults with Atopic Dermatitis Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and CHRONOS) and one dose-ranging trial (AD-1021) evaluated the safety of DUPIXENT in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD. The safety population had a mean age of 38 years; 41% of subjects were female, 67% were White, 24% were Asian, and 6% were Black; in terms of co-morbid conditions, 48% of the subjects had asthma, 49% had allergic rhinitis, 37% had food allergy, and 27% had allergic conjunctivitis. In these 4 trials, 1472 subjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of DUPIXENT, with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS). A total of 739 subjects were treated with DUPIXENT for at least 1 year in the development program for moderate-to-severe AD. SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021 compared the safety of DUPIXENT monotherapy to placebo through Week 16. CHRONOS compared the safety of DUPIXENT + TCS to placebo + TCS through Week 52. AD-1225 is a multicenter, open-label extension (OLE) trial which assessed the long-term safety of repeat doses of DUPIXENT through 260 weeks of treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe AD who had previously participated in controlled trials of DUPIXENT or had been screened for SOLO 1 or SOLO 2. The safety data in AD-1225 reflect exposure to DUPIXENT 200 mg QW, 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W in 2677 subjects, including 2254 exposed for at least 52 weeks, 1224 exposed for at least 100 weeks, 561 exposed for at least 148 weeks and 179 exposed for at least 260 weeks. Weeks 0 to 16 (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, CHRONOS, and AD-1021) In DUPIXENT monotherapy trials (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021) through Week 16, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1.9% in both the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W and placebo groups. Table 7 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W monotherapy groups, and in the DUPIXENT + TCS group, all at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups during the first 16 weeks of treatment. Table 7: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of the DUPIXENT Monotherapy Group or the DUPIXENT + TCS Group in the Atopic Dermatitis Trials through Week 16 Adverse Reaction DUPIXENT Monotherapy Pooled analysis of SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021.

Two subjects discontinued DUPIXENT because of adverse reactions: atopic dermatitis (1 subject) and exfoliative dermatitis (1 subject). The safety profile of DUPIXENT + TCS through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 16. Safety through 260 Weeks (AD-1225) The long-term safety profile observed in this trial through 260 weeks was generally consistent with the safety profile of DUPIXENT observed in controlled studies. Pediatric Subjects 12 to 17 Years of Age with Atopic Dermatitis The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in a trial of 250 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD (AD-1526). The safety profile of DUPIXENT in these subjects through Week 16 was similar to the safety profile seen in adults with AD. The long-term safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in an open-label extension study in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD (AD-1434). The safety profile of DUPIXENT in subjects followed through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed at Week 16 in AD-1526. The long-term safety profile of DUPIXENT observed in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age was consistent with that seen in adults with AD. Pediatric Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age with Atopic Dermatitis The safety of DUPIXENT with concomitant TCS was assessed in a trial of 367 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with severe AD (AD-1652). The safety profile of DUPIXENT + TCS in these subjects through Week 16 was similar to the safety profile from trials in adult and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with AD. The long-term safety of DUPIXENT ± TCS was assessed in an open-label extension study of 368 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with AD (AD-1434). Among subjects who entered this study, 110 (30%) had moderate and 72 (20%) had severe AD at the time of enrollment in AD-1434. The safety profile of DUPIXENT ± TCS in subjects followed through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed through Week 16 in AD-1652. The long-term safety profile of DUPIXENT ± TCS observed in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age was consistent with that seen in adult and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with AD [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Pediatric Subjects 6 Months to 5 Years of Age with Atopic Dermatitis The safety of DUPIXENT with concomitant TCS was assessed in a trial of 161 pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age with moderate-to-severe AD (AD-1539). The safety profile of DUPIXENT + TCS in these subjects through Week 16 was similar to the safety profile from trials in adults and pediatric subjects 6 to 17 years of age with AD. The long-term safety of DUPIXENT ± TCS was assessed in an open-label extension study of 180 pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age with AD (AD-1434). The majority of subjects were treated with DUPIXENT 300 mg every 4 weeks. The safety profile of DUPIXENT ± TCS in subjects followed through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile observed through Week 16 in AD-1539. The long-term safety profile of DUPIXENT ± TCS observed in pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age was consistent with that seen in adults and pediatric subjects 6 to 17 years old with AD. In addition, hand-foot-and-mouth disease was reported in 9 (5%) pediatric subjects and skin papilloma was reported in 4 (2%) pediatric subjects treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS. These cases did not lead to study drug discontinuation [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Atopic Dermatitis with Hand and/or Foot Involvement The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial (Liberty-AD-HAFT) in 133 adult and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis with moderate-to-severe hand and/or foot involvement [see . In this trial 67 subjects received DUPIXENT, and 66 subjects received placebo. DUPIXENT-treated subjects received the recommended dosage based on their age and body weight Clinical Studies (14) ] [see . The safety profile of DUPIXENT in these subjects through Week 16 was consistent with the safety profile from studies in adult and pediatric subjects 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe AD. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Asthma Adults and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Asthma A total of 2888 adult and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma (AS) were evaluated in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (DRI12544, QUEST, and VENTURE). Of these, 2678 had a history of 1 or more severe exacerbations in the year prior to enrollment despite regular use of medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller(s) (DRI12544 and QUEST). A total of 210 subjects with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus up to two additional controllers were enrolled (VENTURE). The safety population (DRI12544 and QUEST) was 12-87 years of age, of which 63% were female, and 82% were White. DUPIXENT 200 mg or 300 mg was administered subcutaneously Q2W, following an initial dose of 400 mg or 600 mg, respectively. In DRI12544 and QUEST, the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 4% of the placebo group, 3% of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, and 6% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group. Table 8 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups in DRI12544 and QUEST. Table 8:          Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of Adult and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Asthma in the DUPIXENT Groups in DRI12544 and QUEST and Greater than Placebo (6 Month Safety Pool) Adverse Reaction DRI12544 and QUEST DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W Placebo N=779 n (%) N=788 n (%) N=792 n (%) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions cluster includes erythema, edema, pruritus, pain, and inflammation. 111 (14%) 144 (18%) 50 (6%) Oropharyngeal pain 13 (2%) 19 (2%) 7 (1%) Eosinophilia Eosinophilia = blood eosinophils ≥3,000 cells/mcL or deemed by the investigator to be an adverse event. None met the criteria for serious eosinophilic conditions [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] 17 (2%) 16 (2%) 2 (<1%) Injection site reactions were most common with the loading (initial) dose. The safety profile of DUPIXENT through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 24. Pediatric Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age with Asthma The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in 405 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with moderate-to-severe asthma (VOYAGE). The safety profile of DUPIXENT in these subjects through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe asthma with the addition of helminth infections. Helminth infections were reported in 2.2% (6 subjects) in the DUPIXENT group and 0.7% (1 subject) in the placebo group. The majority of cases were enterobiasis, reported in 1.8% (5 subjects) in the DUPIXENT group and none in the placebo group. There was one case of ascariasis in the DUPIXENT group. All helminth infection cases were mild to moderate and subjects recovered with anti-helminth treatment without DUPIXENT treatment discontinuation. Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps A total of 722 adult subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) were evaluated in 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration (SINUS-24 and SINUS-52). The safety pool consisted of data from the first 24 weeks of treatment from both studies. In the safety pool, the proportion of adult subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 5% of the placebo group and 2% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group. Table 9 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1% in adult subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in SINUS-24 and SINUS-52.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis Adults and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with EoE A total of 239 adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older, weighing at least 40 kg, with EoE were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, including two 24-week treatment periods (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B) and received either DUPIXENT 300 mg QW or placebo [see . Clinical Studies (14.4) ] The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 2% of the placebo group and 2% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg QW group. Table 10 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in Parts A and B. Table 10: \tAdverse Reactions Occurring in ≥2% of Adult and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with EoE Treated with DUPIXENT in a Placebo-Controlled Trial (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B; 24-Week Safety Pool) Study EoE-1 Parts A and B Adverse Reaction DUPIXENT 300 mg QW N=122 n (%) Placebo N=117 n (%) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions are composed of several terms including, but not limited to, injection site swelling, pain, and bruising. 46 (38%) 39 (33%) Upper respiratory tract infections Upper respiratory tract infections are composed of several terms including, but not limited to, COVID-19, sinusitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. 22 (18%) 12 (10%) Arthralgia 3 (2%) 1 (1%) Herpes viral infections Herpes viral infections are composed of oral herpes and herpes simplex. 3 (2%) 1 (1%) The safety profile of DUPIXENT in 72 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age, weighing at least 40 kg, and adults in Parts A and B was similar. Pediatric Subjects 1 to 11 Years of Age, Weighing at least 15 kg, with EoE A total of 61 pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age, weighing at least 15 kg, with EoE were evaluated in a randomized, blinded, parallel-group, multicenter trial, including an initial 16-week placebo-controlled treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part A) and a 36-week extended active treatment period (Study EoE-2 Part B). Subjects in Part A received a weight-based dosing regimen of DUPIXENT or placebo [see . All subjects in Part B completed Part A and received active treatment with weight-based dosing regimens of DUPIXENT in Part B (N=47). Clinical Studies (14.4) ] The safety profile of DUPIXENT through Week 16 of Study EoE-2 Part A was generally similar to the safety profile in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with EoE. In Part B, a helminth infection was reported in one DUPIXENT-treated subject. Prurigo Nodularis A total of 309 adult subjects with prurigo nodularis (PN) were evaluated in two 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (PRIME and PRIME2). The safety pool included data from the 24-week treatment and 12-week follow-up periods from both trials. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 3% of the placebo group and 0% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group. The safety population had a mean age of 49 years; 65% of subjects were female, 56% were White, 34% were Asian, and 6% were Black or African American. Subjects with co-morbid conditions included 43% of subjects with a history of atopy (defined as having a medical history of AD, allergic rhinitis/rhino conjunctivitis, asthma, or food allergy), 8% of subjects with a history of hypothyroidism and 9% of subjects with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2. Table 11 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator group in PRIME and PRIME2.

Of those randomized, 1872 subjects received at least one dose of DUPIXENT 300 mg or placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W). The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in the pooled safety population from BOREAS and NOTUS, which consisted of 938 adult subjects treated with DUPIXENT. Of the subjects treated with DUPIXENT, 98% utilized inhaled triple therapy at baseline (comprising of an inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting beta-agonist, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist), and 97% had chronic bronchitis. Clinical Studies (14.6) ] Table 12 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than placebo in BOREAS and NOTUS trials. Table 12: \tAdverse Reactions That Occurred in ≥2% of Adult Subjects with COPD Treated with DUPIXENT in BOREAS and NOTUS Trials (Pooled Safety Population) and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction BOREAS and NOTUS DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W Placebo N=938 n (%) N=934 n (%) Viral Infection Consists of multiple similar terms. 133 (14.2) 115 (12.3) Headache 73 (7.8) 62 (6.6) Nasopharyngitis 73 (7.8) 69 (7.4) Back Pain 42 (4.5) 29 (3.1) Diarrhea 35 (3.7) 30 (3.2) Arthralgia 29 (3.1) 25 (2.7) Urinary Tract Infection 28 (3.0) 18 (1.9) Local Administration Reaction 26 (2.8) 6 (0.6) Injection Site Reaction 11 (1.2) 2 (0.2) Rhinitis 24 (2.6) 17 (1.8) Eosinophilia Eosinophilia was defined as blood eosinophils ≥3,000 cells/mcL or deemed by the investigator to be an adverse event.

Among these subjects, serious cholecystitis was reported in 4 (0.4%) of the DUPIXENT group compared with 0% of the placebo group. Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria The pooled safety data below reflects the safety of DUPIXENT in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment. A total of 392 adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with CSU were evaluated for safety in three randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled, studies, Study A, B, and C, conducted under a master protocol (CUPID) for 36 weeks [see . The pooled safety population received an initial dose of DUPIXENT 600 mg or 400 mg, followed by DUPIXENT 300 mg or 200 mg, respectively, or matching placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W) Clinical Studies (14.7) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.9) ] Table 13 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than placebo in CUPID Study A, B and C (pooled safety population). Table 13:\tAdverse Reactions That Occurred in ≥2% of Adult and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with CSU Treated with DUPIXENT in CUPID Study A, B, and C (Pooled Safety Population) and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction CUPID Study A, B, and C DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W or 300 mg Q2W Placebo N=195 n (%) N=197 n (%) Injection site reactions Injection site reactions cluster includes injection site dermatitis, injection site erythema, injection site hematoma, injection site induration, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site reaction, injection site swelling 20 (10.3) 16 (8.1) Specific Adverse Reactions for AD, Asthma, CRSwNP, EoE, PN, COPD, and CSU Conjunctivitis and Keratitis In adult subjects with AD, conjunctivitis was reported in 10% (34 per 100 subject-years) in the 300 mg Q2W dose group and in 2% of the placebo group (8 per 100 subject-years) during the 16-week treatment period of the monotherapy trials (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021). During the 52-week treatment period of concomitant therapy AD trial (CHRONOS), conjunctivitis was reported in 16% of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W + TCS group (20 per 100 subject-years) and in 9% of the placebo + TCS group (10 per 100 subject-years). During the long-term OLE trial with data through 260 weeks (AD-1225), conjunctivitis was reported in 21% of the DUPIXENT group (12 per 100 subject-years). In DUPIXENT AD monotherapy trials (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021) through Week 16, keratitis was reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 subject-years) and in 0% of the placebo group (0 per 100 subject-years). In the 52-week DUPIXENT + topical corticosteroids (TCS) AD trial (CHRONOS), keratitis was reported in 4% of the DUPIXENT + TCS group (4 per 100 subject-years) and in 2% of the placebo + TCS group (2 per 100 subject-years). Conjunctivitis and keratitis occurred more frequently in AD subjects who received DUPIXENT. Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported eye disorder. During the long-term OLE trial with data through 260 weeks (AD-1225), keratitis was reported in 3% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 subject-years). Most subjects with conjunctivitis or keratitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. Among subjects with asthma, the frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. In adult subjects with CRSwNP, the frequency of conjunctivitis was 2% in the DUPIXENT group compared to 1% in the placebo group in the 24-week safety pool; these subjects recovered. In the 52-week CRSwNP study (SINUS-52), the frequency of conjunctivitis was 3% in the DUPIXENT adult subjects and 1% in the placebo subjects; all of these subjects recovered. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the CRSwNP development program [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Among subjects with EoE, there were no reports of conjunctivitis and keratitis in the DUPIXENT group in placebo-controlled trials [see . In the 36-week active treatment extension period of Study EoE-2 Part B, conjunctivitis was reported in 4% of DUPIXENT-treated pediatric subjects with EoE. Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Among subjects with PN, the frequency of conjunctivitis was 4% in the DUPIXENT group compared to 1% in the placebo group; all of these subjects recovered or were recovering during the treatment period. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the PN development program [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Among subjects with COPD, the frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was 1.4% and 0.1% in the DUPIXENT group and 1% and 0% in the placebo group, respectively [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Among subjects with CSU in the pooled safety population, the frequency of conjunctivitis was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. There were no cases of keratitis reported in the CSU development program [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Eczema Herpeticum and Herpes Zoster The rate of eczema herpeticum was similar in the placebo and DUPIXENT groups in the AD trials. The rates remained stable through 260 weeks in the long-term OLE trial (AD-1225). Herpes zoster was reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT groups (1 per 100 subject-years) and in <1% of the placebo group (1 per 100 subject-years) in the 16-week AD monotherapy trials. In the 52-week DUPIXENT + TCS AD trial, herpes zoster was reported in 1% of the DUPIXENT + TCS group (1 per 100 subject-years) and 2% of the placebo + TCS group (2 per 100 subject-years). During the long-term OLE trial with data through 260 weeks (AD-1225), 2.0% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects reported herpes zoster (0.94 per 100 subject-years of follow up). Among asthma subjects the frequency of herpes zoster was similar between DUPIXENT and placebo. Among subjects with CRSwNP or EoE there were no reported cases of herpes zoster or eczema herpeticum. Among subjects with PN, herpes zoster and ophthalmic herpes zoster were each reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT group (1 per 100 subject-years) and 0% of the placebo group. Among subjects with COPD, herpes zoster was reported in 0.9% of the DUPIXENT group and 0.2% of the placebo group. Ophthalmic herpes zoster was reported in 0.1% of the DUPIXENT group and 0.2% of the placebo group. Among subjects with CSU in the pooled safety population, herpes zoster was reported in <1% of the DUPIXENT and placebo groups (1 per 100 subject-years). There were no cases of eczema herpeticum reported in the CSU development program. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in <1% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects. These included anaphylaxis, serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions, generalized urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum, and erythema multiforme [see . Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.6) ] Eosinophils DUPIXENT-treated subjects with AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and COPD had a greater initial increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count compared to subjects treated with placebo. In adult subjects with AD (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 100 and 0 cells/mcL, respectively. In pediatric subjects <6 years old with AD, the mean and median increases from baseline to week 4 were 478 and 90 cells/mcL, respectively. In adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma (DRI12544 and QUEST), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 130 and 10 cells/mcL, respectively. In subjects 6 to 11 years of age with asthma (VOYAGE), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 12 were 124 and 0 cells/mcL, respectively. In adult subjects with CRSwNP (SINUS-24 and SINUS-52), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 16 were 150 and 50 cells/mcL, respectively. In subjects with COPD (BOREAS and NOTUS), the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 8 were 60 and 0 cells/mcL, respectively. An increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count was not observed in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with EoE treated with DUPIXENT as compared to placebo (Study EoE-1). In pediatric subjects 1 to 11 years of age with EoE (Study EoE-2 Part A), blood eosinophil counts were generally consistent with those observed in Study EoE-1. In adult and pediatric subjects with CSU (CUPID Study A, Study B, and Study C) treated with DUPIXENT, an increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count was not observed compared to placebo at Week 12. In subjects with PN (PRIME and PRIME2), the mean and median decrease in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 9 and 10 cells/mcL, respectively. In the trials for the COPD indication, treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥500 cells/mcL) was higher in DUPIXENT (41.7%) than in the placebo group (39.4%); none of the cases were associated with clinical symptoms, and treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥1000 cells/mcL) was higher in DUPIXENT (13.6%) than in the placebo group (8.1%). Across the trials for AD, asthma, CRSwNP, and CSU indications, the incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥500 cells/mcL) was similar in DUPIXENT and placebo groups. In the trials for the PN indication, the incidence of treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥500 cells/mcL) was lower in DUPIXENT than in the placebo group. Treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥5,000 cells/mcL) was observed in <3% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects and <0.5% in placebo-treated subjects (SOLO 1, SOLO 2, and AD-1021; DRI12544, QUEST, and VOYAGE; SINUS-24 and SINUS-52; PRIME and PRIME2; BOREAS and NOTUS; CUPID Study A, B, and C). Blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline or remained below baseline levels (PRIME and PRIME2; BOREAS and NOTUS) during study treatment. In study AD-1539, treatment-emergent eosinophilia (≥5,000 cells/mcL) was reported in 8% of DUPIXENT-treated subjects and 0% in placebo-treated subjects [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Cardiovascular Thromboembolic Events In the 1-year placebo-controlled trial in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma (QUEST), cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.2%) of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group, 4 (0.6%) of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group, and 2 (0.3%) of the placebo group. In the 1-year placebo-controlled trial in subjects with AD (CHRONOS), cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.9%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg Q2W group, 0 (0.0%) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg QW group, and 1 (0.3%) of the placebo + TCS group. In the 24-week placebo-controlled trial in adult subjects with CRSwNP (SINUS-24), cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) were reported in 1 (0.7%) of the DUPIXENT group and 0 (0.0%) of the placebo group. In the 1-year placebo-controlled trial in adult subjects with CRSwNP (SINUS-52), there were no cases of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) reported in any treatment arm. In the 24-week placebo-controlled trial in subjects with EoE (Study EoE-1 Parts A and B), there were no cases of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) reported in any treatment arm. In the 24-week placebo-controlled trial in subjects with CSU (CUPID Study A, B, and C), there were no cases of cardiovascular thromboembolic events (cardiovascular deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarctions, and non-fatal strokes) reported in any treatment arm. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of DUPIXENT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: angioedema Musculoskeletal system disorders: psoriatic arthritis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Facial skin reactions, including erythema, rash, scaling, edema, papules, pruritus, burning, and pain; new-onset psoriasis, vasculitis"
