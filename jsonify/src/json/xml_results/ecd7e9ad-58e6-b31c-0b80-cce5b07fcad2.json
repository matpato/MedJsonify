    "indications": "1  INDICATIONS AND USAGE ProHance Multipack is a gadolinium-based\ncontrast agent indicated for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize: lesions with disrupted blood brain barrier and/or abnormal\nvascularity in the brain (intracranial lesions), spine and associated\ntissues in adults and pediatric patients, including term neonates\n( 1.1 ) lesions in the head and neck in adults ( 1.2 ) 1.1 MRI of the Central\nNervous System (CNS) ProHance is indicated for magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) in adults and pediatric patients including term neonates\nto visualize lesions with disrupted blood brain barrier and/or abnormal\nvascularity in the brain (intracranial lesions), spine and associated\ntissues. 1.2 MRI of Extracranial/Extraspinal\nTissues ProHance\nis indicated for MRI in adults to visualize lesions in the head and\nneck.",
    "contraindications": "4  CONTRAINDICATIONS ProHance\nis contraindicated in patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity\nreactions to ProHance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Allergic or hypersensitivity reactions\nto ProHance ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions with\ncardiovascular, respiratory and cutaneous manifestations, ranging\nfrom mild to severe reactions including shock can occur. Monitor patients\nclosely for need of emergency cardiorespiratory support ( 5.3 ). Gadolinium is retained for months or years in brain, bone,\nand other organs. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Risk Associated with\nIntrathecal Use Intrathecal administration of GBCAs can cause serious adverse reactions\nincluding death, coma, encephalopathy, and seizures. The safety and\neffectiveness of ProHance have not been established with intrathecal\nuse. ProHance is not approved for intrathecal use [see Dosage\nand Administration ( . 2.1 )] 5.2 Nephrogenic Systemic\nFibrosis GBCAs\nincrease the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients\nwith impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of ProHance among\nthese patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and\nnot available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated\nNSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney\ndisease (GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears\nlower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59\nmL/min/1.73m 2 ) and little, if any, for\npatients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis\naffecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis\nof NSF following ProHance Multipack administration to Bracco Diagnostics\n(1-800-257-5181) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch ). Screen patients\nfor acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal\nfunction. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours\nto days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly\nin the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced\nkidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not\nreliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury.\nFor patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example,\nage greater than 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension),\nestimate the GFR through laboratory testing. Among the factors that may increase the risk\nfor NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and\nthe degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the\nspecific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients\nat highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended ProHance dose\nand allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug\nprior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians\nmay consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration\nof a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent’s Page 4 elimination.\nThe usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12 )] 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have\nbeen reported, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous\nmanifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and\ndied. In most cases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of ProHance\nadministration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Prior to ProHance administration,\nensure the availability of trained personnel and medications to treat\nhypersensitivity reactions. Consider the risk for hypersensitivity\nreactions, especially in patients with a history of hypersensitivity\nreactions or a history of asthma or other allergic disorders. If such\na reaction occurs, stop ProHance and immediately begin appropriate\ntherapy. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity\nreaction during and for up to 2 hours after ProHance administration. 5.4 Gadolinium Retention Gadolinium is retained for months or years\nin several organs. The highest concentrations (nanomoles per gram\nof tissue) have been identified in the bone, followed by other organs\n(e.g. brain, skin, kidney, liver, and spleen). The duration of retention\nalso varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more\nretention than macrocyclic GBCAs. At equivalent doses, retention varies\namong the linear agents with Omniscan (gadodiamide) and Optimark (gadoversetamide)\ncausing greater retention than other linear agents [Eovist (gadoxetate\ndisodium), Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine), MultiHance (gadobenate\ndimeglumine)]. Retention is lowest and similar among the macrocyclic\nGBCAs [Dotarem (gadoterate meglumine), Gadavist (gadobutrol), ProHance\n(gadoteridol)]. Consequences\nof gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic\nand clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in\nskin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired\nrenal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( . There are rare reports of\npathologic skin changes in patients with normal renal function. Adverse\nevents involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients\nwith normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium\nretention 5.2 )] [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] While clinical consequences of gadolinium\nretention have not been established in patients with normal renal\nfunction, certain patients might be at higher risk. These include\npatients requiring multiple lifetime doses, pregnant and pediatric\npatients, and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the\nretention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these\npatients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies, particularly closely\nspaced studies when possible. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with chronically reduced renal\nfunction, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with\nthe use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with\nincreasing dose of the contrast agent; administer the lowest dose\nnecessary for adequate imaging.",

The adverse events described in this section were observed in clinical\ntrials involving 3174 subjects (including 2896 adults and 278 pediatric\nsubjects ages 0 to 17 years) exposed to ProHance. Approximately 48%\nof the subjects were men and ethnic distribution was 78% Caucasian,\n6% Black, 3% Hispanic, 6% Asian, and 2% other. In 5% of the subjects,\nrace was not reported. Average age was 47 years (range from 1 day\nto 91 years) and the exposure ranged from 0.03 to 0.3 mmol/kg. Overall, approximately 5.8% of\nsubjects reported one or more adverse reactions during a follow-up\nperiod that ranged from 24 hours to 7 days after ProHance administration. Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 0.4% subjects\nwho received ProHance. Table 2: More frequent adverse reactions in clinical trials Reaction Rate (%) N\n= 3174 Nausea 1.4% Dysgeusia 0.9% Headache 0.7% Dizziness 0.4% Urticaria 0.4% The following additional adverse events occurred in\nfewer than 0.4% of the subjects: General disorders and administration site conditions: Asthenia; chest discomfort, facial edema, feeling hot, injection\nsite coldness, injection site erythema, injection site pain, injection\nsite warmth, pain, pyrexia Cardiac: Angina pectoris, palpitations, atrio-ventricular block first degree Ear and labyrinth disorders: Ear discomfort, tinnitus Eye disorders: Eye pruritis, lacrimation increased Gastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, gingival\npain, oral pruritis, swollen tongue, vomiting Infections and infestations: Gingivitis, rhinitis Investigations: Alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase\nincreased, blood chloride increased, blood pressure immeasurable,\nblood urea decreased, hemoglobin decreased, heart rate increased Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Decreased appetite, hypoglycemia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Back pain, musculoskeletal stiffness Nervous system disorders: Formication, hypoesthesia, hypokinesia, lethargy, loss of consciousness,\nmigraine, paresthesia, presyncope, seizure, syncope, taste disorder Psychiatric disorders: Anxiety, mental status changes Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Cough, dry throat, dyspnea, nasal discomfort, throat irritation Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Hyperhidrosis, pruritis, rash, rash morbilliform Vascular disorders: Flushing, hypotension, peripheral coldness,\nvascular rupture, vasodilatation, vasospasm 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions\nhave been identified during post approval use of ProHance or other\nGBCAs that were not observed in the clinical trials. Because these\nreactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain\nsize, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency\nor establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. * Cases of acute renal failure have been\nreported in patients with pre-existing severe renal impairment. The following adverse drug reactions\nhave also been reported: General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Adverse events with variable onset and duration have been reported\nafter GBCA administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( These include fatigue, asthenia,\npain syndromes, and heterogeneous clusters of symptoms in the neurological,\ncutaneous, and musculoskeletal systems. 5.4 )]. Cardiac disorders: Cardiac arrest, bradycardia, hypertension Gastrointestinal disorders: Acute pancreatitis with onset within 48 hours after GBCA administration Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity/anaphylactoid reactions including cardiac arrest,\ncyanosis, pharyngeal edema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, angioedema,\ncough, sneezing, conjunctivitis, eyelid edema, hyperhidrosis, urticaria [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] Nervous system disorders: Coma, loss of consciousness, vasovagal reaction, tremor Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Respiratory arrest, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary\nedema Renal and urinary system disorders: Acute renal failure *"
