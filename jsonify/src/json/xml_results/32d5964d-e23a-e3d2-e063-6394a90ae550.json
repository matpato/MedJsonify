    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are indicated in pediatric and adult patients for use as a replacement solution in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) to replace plasma volume removed by ultrafiltration and to correct electrolyte and acid-base imbalances. They may also be used in case of drug poisoning when CRRT is used to remove dialyzable substances. PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are indicated: As a replacement solution in Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) and in case of drug poisoning when CRRT is used to remove dialyzable substances ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS PHOXILLUM and PRISMASOL replacement solutions are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivities to these products. Known hypersensitivities to PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor hemodynamic status and fluid inputs and outputs, potassium, phosphorus, other electrolytes and acid-base balance. Abnormalities may be corrected by the use of appropriate formulations and dosage of PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions ( 5.1 ) Treatment may affect glucose levels. Monitor blood glucose levels. Antidiabetic therapy adjustment or other corrective measures may be required during treatment ( 5.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-866-888-2472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 5.1 Electrolyte and Volume Abnormalities PHOXILLUM and PRISMASOL solutions can affect electrolytes and volume and may result in hyperkalemia or hyperphosphatemia. Monitor hemodynamic status and fluid inputs and outputs, potassium, phosphorous, calcium, other electrolytes and acid-base balance throughout the procedure. Abnormalities may be corrected by changing the formulation of replacement solution and/or dialysate, supplementation, or adjusting flow rates appropriately [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2) PHOXILLUM replacement solutions contain hydrogen phosphate, a weak acid that may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis. 5.2 Blood Glucose Abnormalities The use of PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM replacement solutions can affect blood glucose levels resulting in hypo- or hyper-glycemia depending upon the dextrose content of the replacement solution. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly. Patients may require initiation of or modification of antidiabetic therapy or other corrective measures during treatment.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use with these or other similar products and therefore may occur with use of PHOXILLUM or PRISMASOL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Metabolic acidosis Hypotension Acid-base disorders Electrolyte imbalance including calcium ionized increased (reported in PRISMASOL solutions containing calcium), hyperphosphatemia, and hypophosphatemia Fluid imbalance"
