    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Mono-Linyah is a combination of norgestimate, a progestin, and ethinyl estradiol, an estrogen, indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy. ( 1.1 ) 1.1 Oral Contraceptive Mono-Linyah tablets are indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )]",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases (4) Liver tumors or liver disease (4) Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding (4) Breast cancer (4) Co-administration with Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir ( 4 ) Mono-Linyah is contraindicated in females who are known to have or develop the following conditions: A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases. Examples include women who are known to: Smoke, if over age 35 [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Have deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, now or in the past [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Have inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Have cerebrovascular disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Have coronary artery disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Have thrombogenic valvular or thrombogenic rhythm diseases of the heart (for example, subacute bacterial endocarditis with valvular disease, or atrial fibrillation) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Have uncontrolled hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Have diabetes mellitus with vascular disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or migraine headaches with aura [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Women over age 35 with any migraine headaches [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Liver tumors, benign or malignant, or liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Current diagnosis of, or history of, breast cancer, which may be hormone-sensitive [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems: Stop Mono-Linyah if a thrombotic event occurs. Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery. Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. ( 5.1 ) Liver disease: Discontinue Mono-Linyah if jaundice occurs. ( 5.2 ) High blood pressure: If used in women with well-controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Mono-Linyah if blood pressure rises significantly. ( 5.4 ) Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects: Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Mono-Linyah. Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia. ( 5.6 ) Headache: Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Mono-Linyah if indicated. ( 5.7 ) Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea: Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems Stop Mono-Linyah if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic (VTE) event occurs. Stop Mono-Linyah if there is unexplained loss of vision, proptosis, diplopia, papilledema, or retinal vascular lesions. Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . If feasible, stop Mono-Linyah at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization. Start Mono-Linyah no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery, in women who are not breastfeeding. The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week, whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week. The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs. The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke. Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. 5.2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Mono-Linyah is contraindicated in women with liver disease, such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of liver [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded. Discontinue Mono-Linyah if jaundice develops. Liver Tumors Mono-Linyah is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases/100,000 COC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. (4) ]. Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) COC users. However, the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users. 5.3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications, such as COCs. Discontinue Mono-Linyah prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir [see Contraindications ( . Mono-Linyah can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen. 4 )] 5.4 High Blood Pressure Mono-Linyah is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [see Contraindications . For women with well- controlled hypertension, monitor blood pressure and stop Mono-Linyah if blood pressure rises significantly. (4) ] An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs, and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use. The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin. 5.5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users. Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease. A past history of COC-related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use. Women with a history of pregnancy-related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis. 5.6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Mono-Linyah. COCs may decrease glucose tolerance. Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs. Women with hypertriglyceridemia, or a family history thereof, may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs. 5.7 Headache If a woman taking Mono-Linyah develops new headaches that are recurrent, persistent, or severe, evaluate the cause and discontinue Mono-Linyah if indicated. Consider discontinuation of Mono-Linyah in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use (which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event). 5.8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product. In clinical trials of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol Tablets 0.25mg/0.035mg, the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was assessed in 1,647 patients (21,275 evaluable cycles) and 4,826 patients (35,546 evaluable cycles), respectively. A total of 100 (7.5%) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol Tablets 0.25mg/0.035mg, at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. Based on data from the clinical trials, 14-34% of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol Tablets 0.25mg/0.035mg experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year. The percent of women who experienced breakthrough/unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time. Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Mono-Linyah may experience amenorrhea. Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. If scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. 5.9 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Mono-Linyah if depression recurs to a serious degree. 5.10 Malignant Neoplasms Breast Cancer Mono-Linyah is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [see Contraindications (4) ]. Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (<6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [see . Postmarketing Experience (6.2) ] Cervical Cancer Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. 5.11 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, sex hormone-binding globulin, and cortisol-binding globulin. The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased. 5.12 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare. 5.13 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema, exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema. 5.14 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur, especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum. Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Mono-Linyah.8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy, therefore, Mono-Linyah should be discontinued during pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non-genital birth defects (including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects) following exposure to CHCs before conception or during early pregnancy. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 percent and 15 to 20 percent, respectively.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials (≥2%) were: headache/migraine, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, vaginal infection, genital discharge, breast issues (including breast pain, discharge, and enlargement), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered), flatulence, nervousness, rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Vascular events [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol 0.25mg/0.035mg tablets was evaluated in 1,647 healthy women of child-bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol 0.25mg/0.035mg tablets for contraception. Two trials were randomized active-controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open-label trial. In all 3 trials, subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles. Common Adverse Reactions (≥2% of subjects) : The most common adverse reactions reported  by at least 2% of the 1,647 women were the following in order of decreasing incidence: headache/migraine (32.9%), abdominal/gastrointestinal pain (7.8%), vaginal infection (8.4%), genital discharge (6.8%), breast issues (including breast pain, discharge,and enlargement) (6.3%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (5.0%), flatulence (3.2%), nervousness (2.9%), and rash (2.6%). Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation : Over the three trials, between 11 to 21% of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥1%) leading to discontinuation were: metrorrhagia (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (5.0%), headache (4.1%), mood disorders (including depression and mood altered) (2.4%), premenstrual syndrome (1.7%),  hypertension  (1.4%),  breast  pain  (1.4%),  nervousness  (1.3%),  amenorrhea  (1.1%), dysmenorrhea (1.1%), weight increased (1.1%), and flatulence (1.1%). Serious Adverse Reactions : breast cancer (1 subject), mood disorders including depression, irritability, and mood swings (1 subject), myocardial infarction (1 subject), and venous thromboembolic events including pulmonary embolism (1 subject) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1 subject). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Five studies that compared breast cancer risk between ever-users (current or past use) of COCs and never-users of COCs reported no association between ever use of COCs and breast cancer risk, with effect estimates ranging from 0.90 - 1.12 (Figure 1). Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users (<6 months since last use) and never users of COCs (Figure 1). One of these studies reported no association between breast cancer risk and COC use. The other two studies found an increased relative risk of 1.19 - 1.33 with current or recent use. Both of these studies found an increased risk of breast cancer with current use of longer duration, with relative risks ranging from 1.03 with less than one year of COC use to approximately 1.4 with more than 8-10 years of COC use. Figure 1: Relevant Studies of Risk of Breast Cancer with Combined Oral Contraceptives RR = relative risk; OR = odds ratio; HR = hazard ratio. “ ever COC ” are females with current or past COC use; “ never COC use ” are females that never used COCs. The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations : Urinary tract infection; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (Incl. Cysts and Polyps) : Breast cancer, benign breast neoplasm, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, breast cyst; Immune System Disorders : Anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Dyslipidemia; Psychiatric Disorders : Anxiety, insomnia; Nervous System Disorders : Syncope, convulsion, paresthesia, dizziness; Eye Disorders : Visual impairment, dry eye, contact lens intolerance; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : Vertigo; Cardiac Disorders : Tachycardia, palpitations; Vascular Events : Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vascular thrombosis, hot flush, venous thrombosis (including Budd Chiari Syndrome and hepatic vein thrombosis); Arterial Events: Arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : Dyspnea; Gastrointestinal Disorders : Pancreatitis, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation; Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Angioedema, erythema nodosum, hirsutism, night sweats, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria, pruritus, acne; Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue, and Bone Disorders : Muscle spasms, pain in extremity, myalgia, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : Ovarian cyst, suppressed lactation, vulvovaginal dryness; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Chest pain, asthenic conditions. figure1"
