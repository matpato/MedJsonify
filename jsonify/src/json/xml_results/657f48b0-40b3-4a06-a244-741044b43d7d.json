    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE KYBELLA ® (deoxycholic acid) injection is indicated for improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe convexity or fullness associated with submental fat in adults. Limitations of use The safe and effective use of KYBELLA for the treatment of subcutaneous fat outside the submental region has not been established and is not recommended. KYBELLA is a cytolytic drug indicated for improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe convexity or fullness associated with submental fat in adults. ( 1 ) Limit ation s of use The safe and effective use of KYBELLA for the treatment of subcutaneous fat outside the submental region has not been established and is not recommended. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS KYBELLA injection is contraindicated in the presence of infection at the injection sites. KYBELLA is contraindicated: In the presence of infection at the injection sites . ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PR E CAUTIONS Marginal mandibular nerve (MMN) injury: Follow injection technique to avoid this injury. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Dysphagia may occur with KYBELLA use.  Use in patients with pre-existing dysphagia may exacerbate the condition. ( 5.2 ) Submental hematoma/bruising occurs frequently after KYBELLA administration.  Use with caution in patients who are being treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or have coagulation abnormalities. ( 5.3 ) Avoid injecting in proximity to vulnerable anatomic structures due to the increased risk of tissue damage and vascular injury. ( 2.3 , 5.4 ) Injection site alopecia: Withhold subsequent treatments until resolution. ( 5.5 ) Injection site ulceration, necrosis, and infection: Do not administer to the affected area until complete resolution. ( 5.6 ) 5 . 1 Marginal mandibular nerve injury Cases of marginal mandibular nerve injury, manifested as an asymmetric smile or facial muscle weakness (paresis), were reported during clinical trials.  To avoid the potential for nerve injury, KYBELLA injection should not be injected into or in close proximity to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. All marginal mandibular nerve injuries reported from the trials resolved spontaneously (range 1-298 days, median 44 days). 5 . 2 Dysphagia Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) occurred in clinical trials in the setting of administration site reactions, e.g., pain, swelling, and induration of the submental area.  Cases of dysphagia spontaneously resolved (range 1-81 days, median 3 days). Subjects with current or prior history of dysphagia were excluded from clinical trials.  Avoid use of KYBELLA in these patients as current or prior history of dysphagia may exacerbate the condition. 5.3 Injection site hematoma /bruising In clinical trials, 72% of subjects treated with KYBELLA experienced injection site hematoma/bruising [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . KYBELLA should be used with caution in patients with bleeding abnormalities or who are currently being treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy as excessive bleeding or bruising in the treatment area may occur. 5.4 Risk of injecting in proximity to vulnerable anatomic structure s To avoid potential tissue damage, KYBELLA should not be injected into or in close proximity (1-1.5 cm) to salivary glands, lymph nodes and muscles. Care should be taken to avoid inadvertent injection directly into an artery or a vein as it can result in vascular injury. 5.5 Injection site alopecia Cases of injection site alopecia have been reported with the administration of KYBELLA. The onset and duration of this adverse reaction may vary among individuals and may persist. Consider withholding subsequent treatments until resolution of the adverse reaction. 5.6 Injection site ulceration , necrosis , and infection Injections that are too superficial (into the dermis) may result in skin ulceration and necrosis [see Injection Technique ( 2.3 )] . Cases of injection site ulceration, necrosis, and infection have been reported with the administration of KYBELLA. Some cases of injection site infection have included cellulitis and abscess requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment and incision and drainage. Do not administer KYBELLA into the affected area until complete resolution of the adverse reaction.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>20% of subjects) include injection site edema/swelling, hematoma, pain, numbness, erythema and induration. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan at 1-800-678-1605  or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials 513 subjects were treated with KYBELLA injection and 506 subjects were treated with placebo.  The population was 19-65 years old, 85% were women, 87% Caucasian, 8% African American.  At baseline the population had a mean BMI of 29 kg/m 2 , moderate to severe submental convexity (graded as 2 or 3 on a 0 to 4 scale) and without excessive skin laxity.  Subjects received up to 6 treatments at least 1 month apart and were followed for up to 6 months after the last received treatment. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are listed below ( Table 1 ). Table 1. Adverse Reactions in the Pooled Trials 1 and 2 a Adverse reactions KYBELLA (N=513) n (%) Placebo (N=506) n (%) Injection site reactions 492 (96%) 411 (81%) edema/swelling 448 (87%) 218 (43%) hematoma/bruising 368 (72%) 353 (70%) pain 356 (70%) 160 (32%) numbness 341 (66%) 29 (6%) erythema 136 (27%) 91 (18%) induration 120 (23%) 13 (3%) paresthesia 70 (14%) 20 (4%) nodule 68 (13%) 14 (3%) pruritus 64 (12%) 30 (6%) skin tightness 24 (5%) 6 (1%) site warmth 22 (4%) 8 (2%) nerve injury b 20 (4 %) 1 (<1%) Headache 41 (8%) 20 (4%) Oropharyngeal pain 15 (3%) 7 (1%) Hypertension 13 (3%) 7 (1%) Nausea 12 (2%) 3 (1%) Dysphagia 10 (2%) 1 (<1%) a Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% KYBELLA treated subjects and at greater incidence than placebo b Marginal mandibular nerve paresis Other adverse reactions associated with the use of KYBELLA include: injection site hemorrhage, injection site discoloration, pre-syncope/syncope, lymphadenopathy, injection site urticaria, and neck pain. Adverse reactions that lasted more than 30 days and occurred in more than 10% of subjects were injection site numbness (42%), injection site edema/swelling (20%), injection site pain (16%), and injection site induration (13%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KYBELLA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to KYBELLA exposure. Administration site conditions : injection site ulceration, necrosis, infection, alopecia, scarring, and mass. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, and itching. Nervous System Disorders: Oral hypoaesthesia and oral paraesthesia. Procedural Complications: Vascular injury due to inadvertent intravascular injection."
