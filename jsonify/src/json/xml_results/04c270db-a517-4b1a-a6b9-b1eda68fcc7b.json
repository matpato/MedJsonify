    "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Phendimetrazine tartrate is indicated in the management of exogenous obesity as a short term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction in patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or higher who have not responded to appropriate weight reducing regimen (diet and/or exercise) alone. Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient’s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient’s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds ÷ 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters. Phendimetrazine tartrate is indicated for use as monotherapy only. bmi index",
    "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Known hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to sympathomimetics. Advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, moderate and severe hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and glaucoma. Highly nervous or agitated patients. Patients with a history of drug abuse. Patients taking other CNS stimulants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS: Phendimetrazine tartrate should not be used in combination with other anorectic agents, including prescribed drugs, over-the-counter preparations and herbal products. In a case-control epidemiological study, the use of anorectic agents, including phendimetrazine tartrate, was associated with an increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, a rare, but often fatal disorder. The use of anorectic agents for longer than three months was associated with a 23-fold increase in the risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. Increased risk of pulmonary hypertension with repeated courses of therapy cannot be excluded. The onset or aggravation of exertional dyspnea, or unexplained symptoms of angina pectoris, syncope, or lower extremity edema suggest the possibility of occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. Under these circumstances, phendimetrazine tartrate should be immediately discontinued, and the patient should be evaluated for the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension. Valvular heart disease associated with the use of some anorectic agents such as fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine has been reported. Possible contributing factors include use for extended periods of time, higher than recommended dose, and/or use in combination with other anorectic drugs. However, no cases of this valvulopathy have been reported when phendimetrazine tartrate has been used alone. The potential risk of possible serious adverse effects such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension should be assessed carefully against the potential benefit of weight loss. Baseline cardiac evaluation should be considered to detect pre-existing valvular heart diseases or pulmonary hypertension prior to initiation of phendimetrazine treatment. Phendimetrazine tartrate is not recommended in patients with known heart murmur or valvular heart disease. Echocardiogram during and after treatment could be useful for detecting any valvular disorders which may occur. To limit unwarranted exposure and risks, treatment with phendimetrazine tartrate should be continued only if the patient has satisfactory weight loss within the first 4 weeks of treatment (i.e., weight loss of at least 4 pounds, or as determined by the physician and patient). Tolerance to the anorectic effect of phendimetrazine develops within a few weeks. When this occurs, its use should be discontinued; the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded. Use of phendimetrazine tartrate within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in a hypertensive crisis. Abrupt cessation of administration following prolonged high dosage results in extreme fatigue and depression. Because of the effect on the central nervous system, phendimetrazine tartrate may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly. Phendimetrazine tartrate is not recommended for patients who used any anorectic agents within the prior year.PRECAUTIONS: Caution is to be exercised in prescribing phendimetrazine for patients with even mild hypertension. Insulin requirements in diabetes mellitus may be altered in association with the use of phendimetrazine tartrate and the concomitant dietary regimen. Phendimetrazine tartrate may decrease the hypotensive effect of guanethidine. The least amount feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage. Only yellow tablet contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity. Drug Interactions: Efficacy of phendimetrazine tartrate with other anorectic agents has not been studied and the combined use may have the potential for serious cardiac problems. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies with Phendimetrazine Tartrate have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phendimetrazine tartrate. It is also not known whether phendimetrazine tartrate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Usage in Pregnancy: Safe use in pregnancy has not been established. Until more information is available, phendimetrazine tartrate should not be taken by women who are or may become pregnant unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, phendimetrazine tartrate should not be taken by women who are nursing unless, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS: Cardiovascular: Palpitations, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, ischemic events. Valvular heart disease associated with the use of some anorectic agents such as fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, both independently and especially when used in combination with other anorectic drugs, have been reported. However, no case of this valvulopathy has been reported when phendimetrazine tartrate has been used alone. Central Nervous System: Overstimulation, restlessness, insomnia, agitation, flushing, tremor, sweating, dizziness, headache, psychotic state, blurring of vision. Gastrointestinal: Dryness of the mouth, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain. Genitourinary: Urinary frequency, dysuria, changes in libido."
