    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE VYKAT XR is indicated for the treatment of hyperphagia in adults and pediatric patients 4 years of age and older with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). VYKAT XR is indicated for the treatment of hyperphagia in adults and pediatric patients 4 years of age and older with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). ( 1 )",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS VYKAT XR is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to diazoxide, other components of VYKAT XR, or to thiazides. Erythema multiforme has been reported with VYKAT XR [see . Adverse Reactions (6) ] Known hypersensitivity to diazoxide, other components of VYKAT XR, or to thiazides. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hyperglycemia : Hyperglycemia, including diabetic ketoacidosis, has been reported. During treatment, monitor fasting glucose and HbA1c. Monitor fasting glucose more frequently during first few weeks of treatment in patients with risk factors for hyperglycemia. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Risk of Fluid Overload : Edema, including severe reactions associated with fluid overload, has been reported. Monitor for signs or symptoms of edema or fluid overload. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) 5.1 Hyperglycemia VYKAT XR increases blood glucose, due primarily to an inhibition of insulin release from the pancreas. Hyperglycemia, including severe adverse reactions associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, occurred in VYKAT XR-treated patients during clinical trials [see . Adverse Reactions (6) ] Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis may include reduction in the dosages of concomitant antihyperglycemic medications, increase in the dosages of concomitant growth hormone, intercurrent illness, surgery, volume depletion or alcohol abuse. Signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise and shortness of breath. Before initiating VYKAT XR, test fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c; optimize blood glucose in patients who have hyperglycemia. After initiating treatment with VYKAT XR, regularly monitor fasting glucose (FPG or fasting blood glucose) and HbA1c [see . Monitor fasting glucose more frequently for the first few weeks of treatment with VYKAT XR in patients with risk factors for hyperglycemia, such as obesity, elevated FPG, HbA1c at the upper limit of normal or above, concomitant use of growth hormone, or concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., excessive thirst, urinating more often than usual or higher amount of urine than usual, or increased appetite with weight loss). If a patient experiences hyperglycemia after initiating treatment with VYKAT XR, monitor fasting glucose as clinically indicated, and at least twice weekly until fasting glucose decreases to normal levels. Consider monitoring ketones in patients with worsening hyperglycemia. If hyperglycemia is treated with anti-hyperglycemic medication during VYKAT XR treatment, continue monitoring fasting glucose at least once a week for 8 weeks, followed by once every 2 weeks and as clinically indicated. Consider consultation with a healthcare provider with expertise in the treatment of hyperglycemia and counsel patients on lifestyle changes. Based on the severity of the hyperglycemia, VYKAT XR may require dosage interruption, reduction, or discontinuation in order to avoid progression to ketoacidosis [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.2 Risk of Fluid Overload Edema, including general, localized, and peripheral edema, occurred in 27% of VYKAT XR-treated patients versus 12% of placebo-treated patients in the placebo-controlled trial with treatment-naïve\n subjects (Study 1). Severe adverse reactions associated with fluid overload, including pulmonary edema, were reported in VYKAT XR-treated patients during clinical trials [see . Adverse Reactions (6) ] The antidiuretic property of diazoxide may lead to significant fluid retention, which may precipitate congestive heart failure in patients with compromised cardiac reserve. VYKAT XR has not been studied in patients with compromised cardiac reserve and should be used with caution in these patients. Monitor for signs or symptoms of edema or fluid overload and consider appropriate clinical management, which may include VYKAT XR dosage reduction or treatment interruption, if clinically significant [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Risk of Fluid Overload [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies of VYKAT XR in Patients with PWS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the clinical study development program for treatment of hyperphagia in patients aged 4 years and older with PWS, a total of 125 patients received at least 1 dose of VYKAT XR. Patients received dosages of VYKAT XR up to 5.8 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum dosage of 525 mg/day) for up to 4.86 years (median: 3.0 years) in the following studies: Study 1: 13-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study in which 126 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to VYKAT XR or placebo and received at least one dose of VYKAT XR. Study 2-OLE: A long-term, open-label, maintenance treatment period in 115 patients (mean duration 2.6 years; maximum duration 4.3 years) who had previously been enrolled in Study 1. Study 2-RWP: A 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal treatment period, in which 77 patients who had completed Study 1 and Study 2-OLE were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to VYKAT XR or placebo [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] Study 3: A long-term, open-label, maintenance study in 77 patients who had completed Study 1 and Study 2-OLE. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in VYKAT XR-treated patients included aggression, diabetes mellitus, fluid retention, hirsutism, hyperglycemia, lower respiratory tract infection, peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, and papular rash. The primary safety analyses are based on Study 1. The most common adverse reactions (10% or more and at least 2% greater than in placebo) in Study 1 were hypertrichosis, edema, hyperglycemia, and rash. Table 3 presents adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients in Study 1 receiving VYKAT XR and 2% more frequently in VYKAT XR-treated patients than placebo. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥5% of Patients with PWS Receiving VYKAT XR and at Least 2% Greater than Placebo in Study 1 Adverse Reaction VYKAT XR (N=84) Placebo (N=42) Hypertrichosis 36% 14% Edema Edema includes peripheral edema, periorbital edema, swelling face, pulmonary edema, and peripheral swelling. 27% 12% Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia includes type 2 diabetes mellitus. 17% 5% Rash Rash includes contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, maculo-papular rash, papular rash, and urticaria. 12% 2% Pyrexia 6% 0% Arthralgia 5% 2% Influenza 5% 2% Nasopharyngitis 5% 2% In Study 2-RWP, the adverse reactions that occurred most frequently (at least 5%) and to a greater extent than placebo included: Immune System Disorders: Seasonal allergy Investigations: Increased weight Nervous System Disorders: Hyperphagia, anxiety, affect lability, anger, compulsive hoarding, suicidal ideation Respiratory Disorders: Streptococcal pharyngitis, upper respiratory infection Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Hirsutism Erythema multiforme was reported in one subject in Study 1. One subject in Study 3 experienced a serious adverse reaction of diabetic ketoacidosis. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials or Postmarketing Experience of Diazoxide in An Unapproved Population The following adverse reactions associated with use of diazoxide for an unapproved population have been identified in clinical studies or post-marketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity Investigations: Increased serum uric acid, transient neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit, eosinophilia Respiratory Disorders: Pulmonary hypertension Special Senses: Cataracts Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Abnormal facial features Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥10% and at least 2% greater than in placebo) are hypertrichosis, edema, hyperglycemia, and rash.
