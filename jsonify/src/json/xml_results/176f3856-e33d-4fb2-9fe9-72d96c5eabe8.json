    "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is indicated for: Pantoprazole sodium is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) indicated for the following: Short-Term Treatment of Erosive Esophagitis Associated with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) ( 1.1 ) Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis ( 1.2 ) Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions Including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Short-Term Treatment of Erosive Esophagitis Associated With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is indicated in adults and pediatric patients five years of age and older for the short-term treatment (up to 8 weeks) in the healing and symptomatic relief of erosive esophagitis (EE). For those adult patients who have not healed after 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 8-week course of pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension may be considered. Safety of treatment beyond 8 weeks in pediatric patients has not been established. 1.2 Maintenance of Healing of Erosive Esophagitis Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is indicated for maintenance of healing of EE and reduction in relapse rates of daytime and nighttime heartburn symptoms in adult patients with GERD. Controlled studies did not extend beyond 12 months. 1.3 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is indicated for the long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions, including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome.",
    "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation or any substituted benzimidazole. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urticaria [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension, are contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] Patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation or to substituted benzimidazoles ( 4 ) Patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products ( 4 , 7 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy: In adults, symptomatic response does not preclude presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. ( 5.1 ) Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis : Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients. ( 5.2 ) Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea. ( 5.3 ) Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue pantoprazole and refer to specialist for evaluation. ( 5.6 ) Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency : Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.7 ) Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism : Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( 5.8 ) Fundic Gland Polyps: Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.3 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like pantoprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of PPIs [see Adverse Reactions ( . Discontinue pantoprazole at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 6.2 )] 5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving pantoprazole, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.7 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Generally, daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.8 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of pantoprazole and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI. 5.9 Tumorigenicity Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( . 13.1 )] 5.10 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.11 Interference with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.2 )] 5.12 Interference with Urine Screen for THC There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs, including pantoprazole [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] 5.13 Concomitant Use of Pantoprazole with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling: Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Clostridium difficile- Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Bone Fracture [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Fundic Gland Polyps [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Most common adverse reactions are: For adult use (>2%): headache, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, flatulence, dizziness, and arthralgia. ( 6.1 ) For pediatric use (>4%): URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cipla Ltd. at 1-866-604-3268 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The adverse reaction profiles for pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are similar. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adults Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H 2 -receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another PPI, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials of Adult Patients with GERD at a Frequency of >2% Pantoprazole (n=1473) % Comparators (n=345) % Placebo (n=82) % Headache 12.2 12.8 8.5 Diarrhea 8.8 9.6 4.9 Nausea 7.0 5.2 9.8 Abdominal pain 6.2 4.1 6.1 Vomiting 4.3 3.5 2.4 Flatulence 3.9 2.9 3.7 Dizziness 3.0 2.9 1.2 Arthralgia 2.8 1.4 1.2 Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in clinical trials with a frequency of ≤2% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis Hematologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated CK (creatine kinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver enzymes elevated Musculoskeletal: myalgia Nervous: depression, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria, rash, pruritus Special Senses: blurred vision Pediatric Patients Safety of pantoprazole in the treatment of EE associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to pantoprazole are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (>4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain. For safety information in patients less than 1 year of age see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported for pantoprazole in pediatric patients in clinical trials with a frequency of ≤4% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, facial edema Gastrointestinal: constipation, flatulence, nausea Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated triglycerides, elevated liver enzymes, elevated CK (creatine kinase) Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous: dizziness, vertigo Skin and Appendages: urticaria The following adverse reactions seen in adults in clinical trials were not reported in pediatric patients in clinical trials, but are considered relevant to pediatric patients: photosensitivity reaction, dry mouth, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, generalized edema, depression, pruritus, leukopenia, and blurred vision. Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome In clinical studies of ZE Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients taking pantoprazole 80 mg/day to 240 mg/day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pantoprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are listed below by body system: Gastrointestinal Disorders: fundic gland polyps General Disorders and Administration Conditions: asthenia, fatigue, malaise Hematologic: pancytopenia, agranulocytosis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatocellular damage leading to jaundice and hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock), systemic lupus erythematosus Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea Investigations: weight changes Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders: hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia Musculoskeletal Disorders: rhabdomyolysis, bone fracture Nervous: ageusia, dysgeusia Psychiatric Disorders: hallucination, confusion, insomnia, somnolence Renal and Genitourinary Disorders: acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, erectile dysfunction Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: severe dermatologic reactions (some fatal), including erythema multiforme, SJS/TEN, DRESS, AGEP, angioedema (Quincke's edema) and cutaneous lupus erythematosus"
