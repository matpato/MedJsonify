    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hepatic Injury:  EPIDIOLEX can cause transaminase elevations.  Concomitant use of valproate and higher doses of EPIDIOLEX increase the risk of transaminase elevations.  See Full Prescribing Information for serum transaminase and bilirubin monitoring recommendations. ( 5.1 ) • Somnolence and Sedation:  Monitor for somnolence and sedation and advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on EPIDIOLEX. ( 5.2 ) • Suicidal Behavior and Ideation:  Monitor patients for suicidal behavior and thoughts. ( 5.3 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions:  Advise patients to seek immediate medical care.  Discontinue and do not restart EPIDIOLEX if hypersensitivity occurs. ( 5.4 ) • Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs:  EPIDIOLEX should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hepatic Injury EPIDIOLEX can cause dose-related elevations of liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]).  In controlled studies for LGS and DS (10 and 20 mg/kg/day dosages) and TSC (25 mg/kg/day), the incidence of ALT elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) was 13% (10 and 20 mg/kg/day dosages) and 12% (25 mg/kg/day dosage) in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients compared with 1% in patients on placebo.  Less than 1% of EPIDIOLEX-treated patients had ALT or AST levels greater than 20 times the ULN.  There were cases of transaminase elevations associated with hospitalization in patients taking EPIDIOLEX.  In clinical trials, serum transaminase elevations typically occurred in the first two months of treatment initiation; however, there were some cases observed up to 18 months after initiation of treatment, particularly in patients taking concomitant valproate.  Resolution of transaminase elevations occurred with discontinuation of EPIDIOLEX or reduction of EPIDIOLEX and/or concomitant valproate in about two-thirds of the cases.  In about one-third of the cases, transaminase elevations resolved during continued treatment with EPIDIOLEX, without dose reduction. In the postmarketing setting, cases of cholestatic or mixed patterns of liver injury (i.e., based on calculated ratio of [ALT/ULN]/[ALP/ULN] less than 2 and between 2-5, respectively) were reported in patients treated with EPIDIOLEX. Risk Factors for Transaminase Elevation Concomitant Valproate and Clobazam The majority of ALT elevations in the controlled studies occurred in patients taking concomitant valproate [see Drug Interactions ( .  Concomitant use of clobazam also increased the incidence of transaminase elevations, although to a lesser extent than valproate 7.3 )] [see Drug Interactions ( .  In EPIDIOLEX-treated patients with LGS or DS (10 and 20 mg/kg/day dosages), the incidence of ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN was 30% in patients taking both concomitant valproate and clobazam, 21% in patients taking concomitant valproate (without clobazam), 4% in patients taking concomitant clobazam (without valproate), and 3% in patients taking neither drug.  In EPIDIOLEX-treated patients with TSC (25 mg/kg/day), the incidence of ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN was 20% in patients taking both concomitant valproate and clobazam, 25% in patients taking concomitant valproate (without clobazam), 0% in patients taking concomitant clobazam (without valproate), and 6% in patients taking neither drug. 7.2 )] Consider discontinuation or dose adjustment of valproate or clobazam if liver enzyme elevations occur. In the postmarketing setting, cases of elevated ammonia levels were reported in some EPIDIOLEX-treated patients who also had transaminase elevations; where data were available, most cases reported concomitant use of valproate, clobazam, or both. Consider discontinuation or dose adjustment of valproate or clobazam if ammonia level elevations occur. Dose Transaminase elevations are generally dose-related.  In patients with DS or LGS (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) or TSC (25 mg/kg/day), ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN were reported in 17% and 12% of patients taking EPIDIOLEX 20 or 25 mg/kg/day, respectively, compared with 1% in patients taking EPIDIOLEX 10 mg/kg/day.  The risk of ALT elevations was higher (25%) in patients with TSC receiving a dosage above the recommended maintenance dosage of 25 mg/kg/day in Study 4. Baseline Transaminase Elevations Patients with baseline transaminase levels above the ULN had higher rates of transaminase elevations when taking EPIDIOLEX.  In the DS and LGS controlled trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3) in patients taking EPIDIOLEX 20 mg/kg/day, the frequency of treatment-emergent ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN was 30% when ALT was above the ULN at baseline, compared to 12% when ALT was within the normal range at baseline.  No patients taking EPIDIOLEX 10 mg/kg/day experienced ALT elevations greater than 3 times the ULN when ALT was above the ULN at baseline, compared with 2% of patients in whom ALT was within the normal range at baseline.  In the TSC controlled trial (Study 4) in patients taking EPIDIOLEX 25 mg/kg/day, the frequency of treatment-emergent ALT elevations greater than 3 and 5 times the ULN were both 11% when ALT was above the ULN at baseline, compared to 12% and 6%, respectively, when ALT was within the normal range at baseline. Monitoring In general, transaminase elevations of greater than 3 times the ULN in the presence of elevated bilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury.  Early identification of elevated liver enzymes may decrease the risk of a serious outcome.  Patients with elevated baseline transaminase levels above 3 times the ULN, accompanied by elevations in bilirubin above 2 times the ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of EPIDIOLEX treatment. Prior to starting treatment with EPIDIOLEX, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels.  Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of treatment with EPIDIOLEX, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated.  Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should also be obtained within 1 month following changes in EPIDIOLEX dosage and addition of or changes in medications that are known to impact the liver.  Consider more frequent monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin in patients who are taking valproate or who have elevated liver enzymes at baseline. If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with EPIDIOLEX, as appropriate.  Discontinue EPIDIOLEX in any patients with elevations of transaminase levels greater than 3 times the ULN and bilirubin levels greater than 2 times the ULN.  Patients with sustained transaminase elevations of greater than 5 times the ULN should also have treatment discontinued.  Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases should be evaluated for other possible causes.  Consider dosage adjustment of any coadministered medication that is known to affect the liver (e.g., valproate and clobazam). 5.2  Somnolence and Sedation EPIDIOLEX can cause somnolence and sedation.  In controlled studies for LGS and DS (10 and 20 mg/kg/day dosages), the incidence of somnolence and sedation (including lethargy) was 32% in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients (27% and 34% of patients taking EPIDIOLEX 10 or 20 mg/kg/day, respectively), compared with 11% in patients on placebo and was generally dose-related.  The rate was higher in patients on concomitant clobazam (46% in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients taking clobazam compared with 16% in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients not on clobazam).  In the controlled study for TSC, the incidence of somnolence and sedation (including lethargy) was 19% in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients (25 mg/kg/day), compared with 17% in patients on placebo. The rate was higher in patients on concomitant clobazam (33% in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients taking clobazam compared with 14% in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients not on clobazam).  In general, these effects were more common early in treatment and may diminish with continued treatment.  Other CNS depressants, including alcohol, could potentiate the somnolence and sedation effect of EPIDIOLEX.  Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on EPIDIOLEX to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery. 5.3  Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including EPIDIOLEX, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication.  Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo.  In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated.  There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.  Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.  The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication.  The risk did not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.  Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 2: Risk of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials in patients with epilepsy than in clinical trials in patients with psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing EPIDIOLEX or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risk of untreated illness.  Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.  Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. 5.4  Hypersensitivity Reactions EPIDIOLEX can cause hypersensitivity reactions.  Some subjects in the EPIDIOLEX clinical trials had pruritus, erythema, and angioedema requiring treatment, including corticosteroids and antihistamines.  Patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of EPIDIOLEX were excluded from the clinical trials.  If a patient develops hypersensitivity reactions after treatment with EPIDIOLEX, the drug should be discontinued.  EPIDIOLEX is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to cannabidiol or any of the ingredients in the product, which includes sesame seed oil [see Description ( 11 )]. 5.5  Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) As with most antiepileptic drugs, EPIDIOLEX should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Dosage and Administration ( But if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse event, rapid discontinuation can be considered. 2.5 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 )].",

In controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with LGS and DS, 689 patients were treated with EPIDIOLEX, including 533 patients treated for more than 6 months, and 391 patients treated for more than 1 year.  In controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with TSC, 223 patients were treated with EPIDIOLEX, including 151 patients treated for more than 6 months, 88 patients treated for more than 1 year, and 15 patients treated for more than 2 years. In an expanded access program and other compassionate use programs, 271 patients with DS, LGS, or TSC were treated with EPIDIOLEX, including 237 patients treated for more than 6 months, 204 patients treated for more than 1 year, and 140 patients treated for more than 2 years. Patients with LGS or DS In placebo-controlled trials of patients with LGS or DS (includes Studies 1, 2, 3, and a Phase 2 controlled study in DS), 323 patients received EPIDIOLEX [see Clinical Studies ( .  Adverse reactions are presented below; the duration of treatment in these trials was up to 14 weeks.  Approximately 46% of patients were female, 83% were Caucasian, and the mean age was 14 years (range 2 to 48 years).  All patients were taking other AEDs. 14.1 , 14.2 )] In controlled trials in LGS or DS, the rate of discontinuation as a result of any adverse reaction was 2.7% for patients taking EPIDIOLEX 10 mg/kg/day, 11.8% for patients taking EPIDIOLEX 20 mg/kg/day, and 1.3% for patients on placebo.  The most frequent cause of discontinuations was transaminase elevation.  Discontinuation for transaminase elevation occurred at an incidence of 1.3% in patients taking EPIDIOLEX 10 mg/kg/day, 5.9% in patients taking EPIDIOLEX 20 mg/kg/day, and 0.4% in patients on placebo. Somnolence, sedation, and lethargy led to discontinuation in 3% of patients taking EPIDIOLEX 20 mg/kg/day compared to 0% of patients taking EPIDIOLEX 10 mg/kg/day or on placebo. The most common adverse reactions that occurred in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients with LGS or DS (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were somnolence; decreased appetite; diarrhea; transaminase elevations; fatigue, malaise, and asthenia; rash; insomnia, sleep disorder, and poor quality sleep; and infections. Table 3 lists the adverse reactions that were reported in at least 3% of EPIDIOLEX-treated patients, and at a rate greater than those on placebo, in the placebo-controlled trials in LGS and DS.

Patients with TSC In a placebo-controlled trial of patients with TSC (Study 4), 148 patients received EPIDIOLEX [see Clinical Studies ( .  Adverse reactions are presented below; the duration of treatment in this trial was up to 16 weeks.  Approximately 42% of patients were female, 90% were Caucasian, and the mean age was 14 years (range 1 to 57 years).  All patients but one (25 mg/kg/day group) were taking other AEDs. 14.3 )] In the controlled trial in TSC, the rate of discontinuation as a result of any adverse reaction was 11% for patients taking EPIDIOLEX 25 mg/kg/day and 3% for patients on placebo.  The most frequent cause of discontinuation was rash (5%). The most common adverse reactions that occurred in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients with TSC (incidence at least 10% at the recommended dosage and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; transaminase elevations; decreased appetite; somnolence; pyrexia; and vomiting. Table 4 lists the adverse reactions that were reported in at least 3% of EPIDIOLEX-treated patients, and at a rate greater than those on placebo, in the placebo-controlled trial in TSC. Table 4: Adverse Reactions in Patients Treated with EPIDIOLEX in Controlled Trial of TSC (Study 4) Adverse Reactions EPIDIOLEX Placebo 25 mg/kg/day N = 75 % N = 76 % Hematological changes Anemia 7 1 Platelet count decreased 5 1 Eosinophil count increased 5 0 Hepatic Disorders Transaminases elevated 25 0 Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhea 31 25 Decreased appetite 20 12 Vomiting 17 9 Nausea 9 3 Gastroenteritis 8 7 Weight decreased 7 0 Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 13 9 Gait disturbance 9 5 Fatigue, malaise, asthenia 5 1 Infections Ear infection 8 3 Urinary tract infection 5 0 Pneumonia 4 1 Other Pyrexia 19 8 Rash 8 4 Rhinorrhea 4 0 Adverse reactions were similar in pediatric and adult patients with TSC. Additional Adverse Reactions in Patients with LGS, DS, or TSC Decreased Weight EPIDIOLEX can cause weight loss.  In the controlled trials of patients with LGS or DS (10 and 20 mg/kg/day), based on measured weights, 16% of EPIDIOLEX-treated patients had a decrease in weight of at least 5% from their baseline weight, compared to 8% of patients on placebo. The decrease in weight appeared to be dose-related, with 18% of patients on EPIDIOLEX 20 mg/kg/day experiencing a decrease in weight at least 5%, compared to 9% in patients on EPIDIOLEX 10 mg/kg/day. In the controlled trial of patients with TSC (25 mg/kg/day), 31% of EPIDIOLEX-treated patients had a decrease in weight of at least 5% from their baseline weight, compared to 8% of patients on placebo. In some cases, the decreased weight was reported as an adverse event (see Tables 3 and 4). Hematologic Abnormalities EPIDIOLEX can cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit.  In controlled trials of patients with LGS or DS, the mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to end of treatment was -0.42 g/dL in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients receiving 10 or 20 mg/kg/day and -0.03 g/dL in patients on placebo.  A corresponding decrease in hematocrit was also observed, with a mean change of -1.5% in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients, and -0.4% in patients on placebo.  In the trial of patients with TSC, the mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to end of treatment was -0.37 g/dL in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients receiving 25 mg/kg/day and 0.07 g/dL in patients on placebo.  A corresponding decrease in hematocrit was also observed, with a mean change of -1.2% in EPIDIOLEX-treated patients, and -0.2% in patients on placebo. There was no effect on red blood cell indices.  Thirty percent (30%) of EPIDIOLEX-treated patients with LGS and DS and 38% of EPIDIOLEX-treated patients with TSC developed a new laboratory-defined anemia during the course of the study (defined as a normal hemoglobin concentration at baseline, with a reported value less than the lower limit of normal at a subsequent time point), versus 13% of patients with LGS and DS on placebo and 15% of patients with TSC on placebo. Increases in Creatinine EPIDIOLEX can cause elevations in serum creatinine.  The mechanism has not yet been determined.  In controlled studies in healthy adults and in patients with LGS, DS, and TSC, an increase in serum creatinine of approximately 10% was observed within 2 weeks of starting EPIDIOLEX.  The increase was reversible in healthy adults.  Reversibility was not assessed in studies in LGS, DS, or TSC. Increases in Pneumonia with Concomitant Clobazam Pneumonia has been observed in controlled trials in patients with LGS and DS more frequently with clobazam (7 of 41 [17%] in patients receiving 10 mg/kg/day EPIDIOLEX, 13 of 125 [10%] in patients receiving 20 mg/kg/day EPIDIOLEX, and 1 of 123 [1%] receiving placebo) than without concomitant clobazam (0% in patients receiving 10 mg/kg/day EPIDIOLEX, 4 of 113 [4%] in patients receiving 20 mg/kg/day EPIDIOLEX, and 1 of 104 [1%] receiving placebo).  In the controlled trial in patients with TSC, pneumonia was observed more frequently with concomitant clobazam (3 of 18 [17%] in patients receiving 25 mg/kg/day EPIDIOLEX and 0 of 25 [0%] receiving placebo) than without clobazam (0 of 57 [0%] in patients receiving 25 mg/kg/day EPIDIOLEX and 1 of 51 [2%] receiving placebo)."
