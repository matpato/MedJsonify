Begin at a dose of 1 mg once daily and adjust in increments of no more than 1 mg/week (2.2). Do not crush, chew or break tablets before swallowing (2.1). Do not administer with high-fat meals, because of increased exposure (2.1). Do not substitute for immediate-release guanfacine tablets on a mg-per-mg basis, because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles (2.3). If switching from immediate-release guanfacine, discontinue that treatment and titrate with guanfacine extended-release tablets as directed (2.3).
