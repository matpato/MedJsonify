AVODART in combination with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, tamsulosin, is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic BPH in men with an enlarged prostate. ( 1.2 ) Limitations of Use: AVODART is not approved for the prevention of prostate cancer. ( 1.3 )",
    "contraindications": "The capsules should be swallowed whole and not chewed or opened, as contact with the capsule contents may result in irritation of the oropharyngeal mucosa. AVODART may be administered with or without food.",

AVODART capsules should not be handled by women who are pregnant or who could become pregnant because of the potential for absorption of dutasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a developing male fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].",

Dutasteride use is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, dutasteride inhibited development of male fetus external genitalia. Therefore, AVODART may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\n                     \n                        •Patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity (e.g., serious skin reactions, angioedema) to AVODART or other 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]."
