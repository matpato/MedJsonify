    "adverseReactions": "Phenobarbital is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to barbiturates. In such patients, severe hepatic damage can occur from ordinary doses and is usually associated with dermatitis and involvement of parenchymatous organs. A personal or familial history of acute intermittent porphyria represents one of the few absolute contraindications to the use of barbiturates. Phenobarbital is also contraindicated in patients with marked impairment of liver function, or respiratory disease in which dyspnea or obstruction is evident. It should not be administered to persons with known previous addiction to the sedative/hypnotic group, since ordinary doses may be ineffectual and may contribute to further addiction."
