    "indications": "Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.\n                  \n                     Limitations of Use\n                     Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see WARNINGS\n                     ], reserve Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics):\n                  \n                     Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated,\n                     Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia\n                  \n                  Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.",
    "contraindications": "Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, and with other hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solutions of different concentrations, which could result in accidental overdose and death.  Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed.  When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume.\n                        Instruct patients and caregivers on how to accurately measure and take the correct dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solution. Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use a graduated oral syringe or measuring cup, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication.\n                        Inform patients and caregivers that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solution.\n                        Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.\n                        Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see \n                              WARNINGS\n                           ]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.\n                        Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.\n                        There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see \n                              WARNINGS\n                           ].\n                        Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see \n                              WARNINGS\n                           ].",
