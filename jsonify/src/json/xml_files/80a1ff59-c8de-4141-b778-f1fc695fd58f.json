    "indications": "Testosterone topical gel is indicated for replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone: \n                  \n                     Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) – testicular failure due to conditions such as cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, orchiectomy, Klinefelter’s syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage from alcohol, heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone concentrations and gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) above the normal range. \n                     Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) – gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. These men have low serum testosterone concentrations but have gonadotropins in the normal or low range. \n                  \n                  \n                         Limitations of Use\n                  \n                  \n                     Safety and efficacy of testosterone topical gel in men with “age-related hypogonadism” (also referred to as “late-onset hypogonadism”) have not been established.\n                     Safety and efficacy of testosterone topical gel in males less than 18 years old have not been established [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].",
    "contraindications": "Prior to initiating testosterone gel, confirm the diagnosis of hypogonadism by ensuring that serum testosterone concentrations have been measured in the morning on at least 2 separate days and that these serum testosterone concentrations are below the normal range.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Testosterone Topical Gel is supplied in 60 g canisters with a metered dose pump that delivers 10 mg of testosterone, USP per complete pump actuation. The metered dose pump is capable of dispensing 120 metered pump actuations. One (1) pump actuation dispenses 0.5 g of gel. \n                  Testosterone Topical Gel is available in packages of 1 canister (NDC 0591-2363-60).\n                  Store at 20o to 25oC (68o to 77oF) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Do Not Freeze.\n                  Used Testosterone Topical Gel canisters should be discarded in household trash in a manner that prevents accidental application or ingestion by children or pets.",
    "adverseReactions": "Testosterone gel is contraindicated in men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. \n                     \n                     Testosterone gel is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Testosterone can cause virilization of the female fetus when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)]."
