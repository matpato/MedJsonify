    "indications": "Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution is indicated for the relief of bronchospasm in patients 12 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease and acute attacks of bronchospasm.",
    "contraindications": "The usual dosage for adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is 2.5 mg of albuterol (one unit-of-use vial) administered 3 to 4 times daily by nebulization. More frequent administration or higher doses are not recommended. To administer 2.5 mg of albuterol, dilute 0.5 mL of the 0.5% solution for inhalation to a total volume of 3 mL with sterile normal saline solution and administer by nebulization. The flow rate is regulated to suit the particular nebulizer so that albuterol sulfate inhalation solution will be delivered over approximately 5 to 15 minutes.\n                  Drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.\n                  The use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring bouts of bronchospasm. During treatment, most patients gain optimum benefit from regular use of the nebulizer solution.\n                  If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of seriously worsening asthma which would require reassessment of therapy.\n                  The nebulizer should be cleaned in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Failure to do so could lead to bacterial contamination of the nebulizer and possible infection.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, 2.5 mg/0.5 mL (equivalent to 3 mg albuterol sulfate), is a clear, colorless to light yellow solution, and is supplied in plastic sterile unit-dose vials of 0.5 mL each, supplied in individual foil pouches:\n                  NDC 76204-027-01: 30 unit-dose vials, each in an individual pouch.",
    "adverseReactions": "Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to albuterol or any of its components."
