    "indications": "JULUCA is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/mL) on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at least 6 months with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of JULUCA.",
    "contraindications": "• One tablet taken orally once daily with a meal. ( 2.1 ) • Rifabutin coadministration: Take an additional 25-mg tablet of rilpivirine with JULUCA once daily with a meal for the duration of the rifabutin coadministration. ( 2.2 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Each JULUCA tablet contains 50 mg of dolutegravir and 25 mg of rilpivirine, and is a pink, oval, film-coated, biconvex tablet debossed with “SV J3T” on one side.\n                  Bottle of 30 tablets with child-resistant closure (contains a desiccant)       NDC 49702-242-13.\n                  Store and dispense in the original package, protect from moisture, and keep the bottle tightly closed. Do not remove desiccant.\n                  Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].",
