    "indications": "Losartan potassium is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) indicated for: Treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and children greater than 6 years old. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.1 ) Reduction of the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. There is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients. ( 1.2 ) Treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of hypertension. ( 1.3 )",
    "contraindications": "Hypertension Usual adult dose: 50 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Usual pediatric starting dose: 0.7 mg per kg once daily (up to 50 mg). ( 2.1 ) Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Usual starting dose: 50 mg once daily. ( 2.2 ) Add hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and/or increase losartan potassium to 100 mg followed by an increase to hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg if further blood pressure response is needed. ( 2.2 , 14.2 ) Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Usual dose: 50 mg once daily. ( 2.3 ) Increase dose to 100 mg once daily if further blood pressure response is needed. ( 2.3 )",
