If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while taking this drug, the pregnant woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the male fetus. [See also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)and Patient Counseling Information (17.2).] In female rats, low doses of finasteride administered during pregnancy have produced abnormalities of the external genitalia in male offspring."
