(NOTE: Minocycline is not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection).\n                  When penicillin is contraindicated, minocycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections:\n                  Uncomplicated urethritis in men due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and for the treatment of other gonococcal infections.Infections in women caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum.Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue.Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes.Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis.Vincent’s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme.Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii.Infections caused by Clostridium species.\n                  In acute intestinal amebiasis, minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides.\n                  In severe acne, minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy.\n                  Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx. In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers, diagnostic laboratory procedures, including serotyping and susceptibility testing, should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment. It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high.\n                  \n                     Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection.\n                  Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, minocycline hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF MINOCYCLINE DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.\n                  \n                  Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be taken with or without food (see CLINICAL\n                     PHARMACOLOGY).\n                  Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration.

Close follow-up, including laboratory tests, is recommended.\n                  In the treatment of meningococcal carrier state, the recommended dosage is 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days.\n                  \n                     Mycobacterium marinum infections: Although optimal doses have not been established, 100 mg every 12 hours for 6 to 8 weeks have been used successfully in a limited number of cases.\n                  Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum: 100 mg orally, every 12 hours for at least 7 days.\n                  Ingestion of adequate amounts of fluids along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration.\n                  The pharmacokinetics of minocycline in patients with renal impairment (CLCR <80 mL/min) have not been fully characterized. Current data are insufficient to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. The total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours. However, due to the antianabolic effect of tetracyclines, BUN and creatinine should be monitored (see WARNINGS-Antianabolic Action).",
