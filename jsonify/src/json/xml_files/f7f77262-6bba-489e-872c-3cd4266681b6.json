    "indications": "Glycopyrrolate oral solution is indicated to reduce chronic severe drooling in patients aged 3 to 16 years with neurologic conditions associated with problem drooling (e.g., cerebral palsy).",
    "contraindications": "Glycopyrrolate oral solution must be measured and administered with an accurate measuring device [see \n                        \n                           Patient Counseling Information\n                          \n                     \n                        (17)\n                     ]. \n                  \n                  Initiate dosing at 0.02 mg/kg orally three times daily and titrate in increments of 0.02 mg/kg every 5 to 7 days based on therapeutic response and adverse reactions. The maximum recommended dosage is 0.1 mg/kg three times daily not to exceed 1.5 to 3 mg per dose based upon weight. For greater detail, see Table 1.\n                  \n                  During the four-week titration period, dosing can be increased with the recommended dose titration schedule while ensuring that the anticholinergic adverse events are tolerable. Prior to each increase in dose, review the tolerability of the current dose level with the patient’s caregiver. \n                  \n                  Glycopyrrolate oral solution should be dosed at
