    "indications": "Mitomycin for Injection, USP is not recommended as single-agent, primary therapy. It has been shown to be useful in the therapy of disseminated adenocarcinoma of the stomach or pancreas in proven combinations with other approved chemotherapeutic agents and as palliative treatment when other modalities have failed. Mitomycin is not recommended to replace appropriate surgery and/or radiotherapy.",
    "contraindications": "Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.\n                  Mitomycin should be given intravenously only, using care to avoid extravasation of the compound. If extravasation occurs, cellulitis, ulceration, and slough may result.\n                  Each vial contains mitomycin, USP 5 mg and mannitol 10 mg. To administer, add Sterile Water for Injection, 10 mL. Shake to dissolve. If product does not dissolve immediately, allow to stand at room temperature until solution is obtained.\n                  After full hematological recovery (see guide to dosage adjustment) from any previous chemotherapy, the following dosage schedule may be used at 6 to 8 week intervals:\n                  20 mg/m \n       \n \n  2 intravenously as a single dose via a functioning intravenous catheter.\n      \n\n \n                  Because of cumulative myelosuppression, patients should be fully reevaluated after each course of mitomycin, and the dose reduced if the patient has experienced any toxicities.
