    "indications": "Hypertension\n                  \n                  Enalapril maleate tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\n                  Enalapril maleate tablets USP are effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide- type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate tablets USP and thiazides are approximately additive.\n                  \n                     Heart Failure\n                  \n                  Enalapril maleate tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients enalapril maleate tablets USP improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of hospitalization (see\n \n  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trialsfor details and limitations of survival trials).\n\n \n                  \n                     Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction\n                  \n                  In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets USP decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see\n \n  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trialsfor details and limitations of survival trials).\n\n \n                  In using enalapril maleate tablets USP consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate tablets USP does not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS, Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis).\n                  In considering use of enalapril maleate tablets USP, it should be noted that in controlled clinical trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks (see\n \n  WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema).",
