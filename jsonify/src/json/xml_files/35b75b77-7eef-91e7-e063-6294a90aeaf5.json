    "indications": "Ampicillin for injection is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions:\n                  \n                     Respiratory Tract Infectionscaused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae, and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.\n\n \n                  \n                     Bacterial Meningitiscaused by E. coli, Group B streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria (\n \n  Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n \n                  \n                     Septicemia and Endocarditiscaused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including S\n \n  treptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci,and\n \n  enterococci. Gram-negative sepsis caused by\n \n  E. coli,\n \n  Proteus mirabilisand\n \n  Salmonella spp.responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy. The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis.\n\n \n                  \n                     Urinary Tract Infectionscaused by sensitive strains of\n \n  E. coliand\n \n  Proteus mirabilis.\n\n \n                  \n                     Gastrointestinal Infectionscaused by\n \n  Salmonella typhi(typhoid fever), other\n \n  Salmonella spp., and\n \n  Shigella spp.(dysentery) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy.\n\n \n                  Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin for injection and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n                  Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.",

It is designed for use in the pharmacy in preparing IV admixtures using aseptic technique in a laminar flow hood.\n                  a) Add 94 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP. The resulting solution will contain 100 milligrams ampicillin activity per mL and is stable up to\n \n  ONE hourat room temperature.\n\n \n                  b) Dilute further within\n \n  ONE hourto a concentration of 5 mg to 10 mg per mL.

Good professional practice suggests that compounded admixtures should be administered as soon after preparation as is feasible.\n\n \n                  c) Using aseptic technique under a laminar flow hood, the closure should be penetrated only one time after reconstitution using a suitable sterile dispensing set; which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Use of a syringe and needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage.\n                  d) After entry, use entire contents of bottle promptly. The entire contents of the Pharmacy Bulk Package must be dispensed within\n \n  ONE hourof reconstitution. This time limit should begin with the introduction of solvent or diluent into the Pharmacy Bulk Package.\n\n \n                  e) An integral hanger attached to the pharmacy bulk package provides a suitable hanging device while dispensing contents. Use of this product is restricted to a suitable work area, such as a laminar flow hood. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.\n                  \n                     CAUTION: NOT TO BE DISPENSED AS A UNIT.",
