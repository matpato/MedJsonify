    "contraindications": "• Morphine Sulfate Injection should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) • Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Morphine Sulfate Injection for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) • Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) • Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) • Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating the following dosage increases with Morphine Sulfate Injection. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) • Direct Intravenous Injection : Initiate treatment with 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg per kg every 4 hours as needed to manage pain. ( 2.2 ) • Intramuscular Injection : Initiate treatment with 10 mg, every 4 hours as needed to manage pain (based on a 70 kg adult). ( 2.2 ) • Do not abruptly discontinue Morphine Sulfate Injection in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.4 )",
