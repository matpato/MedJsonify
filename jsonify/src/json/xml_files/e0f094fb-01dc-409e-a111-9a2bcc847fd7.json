Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.\n                  Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, eg, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out.",
