In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen\n \n  [see\n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (5.3,\n  \n   5.15)]\n \n  .\n\n \n                  Use estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestogen, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.
