    "indications": "Moexipril hydrochloride tablets are indicated for treatment of patients with hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with thiazide diuretics.\n                  In using moexipril hydrochloride tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that another ACE inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen-vascular disease. Available data are insufficient to show that moexipril hydrochloride tablets do not have a similar risk (see\n \n  WARNINGS).\n\n \n                  In considering use of moexipril hydrochloride tablets, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see\n \n  WARNINGS, Angioedema).",
