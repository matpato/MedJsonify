    "indications": "EXTRANEAL (icodextrin) is indicated for a single daily exchange for the long (8- to 16- hour) dwell during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) for the management of kidney failure in patients requiring long-term kidney replacement therapy. EXTRANEAL is also indicated to improve (compared to 4.25% dextrose) long-dwell ultrafiltration and clearance of creatinine and urea nitrogen in patients with high average or greater transport characteristics, as defined using the peritoneal equilibration test (PET)\n \n  [see Clinical Pharmacology (\n  \n   12), Clinical Studies (\n  \n   14)].",
    "contraindications": "For intraperitoneal administration only. Not for intravenous or intra-arterial administration. Administer as a single daily peritoneal dialysis (PD) exchange for the long dwell. Dosage should be individualized by the prescribing physician experienced in the treatment of kidney failure in patients requiring long-term kidney replacement therapy with PD. ( 2.1 )",
