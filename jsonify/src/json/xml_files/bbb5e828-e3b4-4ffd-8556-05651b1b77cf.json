    "indications": "Predialysis Patients\n                  \n                  Calcitriol capsule is indicated in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone disease in patients with moderate to severe chronic renal failure (Ccr 15 to 55 mL/min) not yet on dialysis. In children, the creatinine clearance value must be corrected for a surface area of 1.73 square meters. A serum iPTH level of ≥ 100 pg/mL is strongly suggestive of secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n                  \n                     Dialysis Patients\n                  \n                  Calcitriol capsule is indicated in the management of hypocalcemia and the resultant metabolic bone disease in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis. In these patients, calcitriol administration enhances calcium absorption, reduces serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and may reduce elevated parathyroid hormone levels and the histological manifestations of osteitis fibrosa cystica and defective mineralization.\n                  \n                     Hypoparathyroidism Patients\n                  \n                  Calcitriol capsule is also indicated in the management of hypocalcemia and its clinical manifestations in patients with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism, idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, and pseudohypopara-thyroidism.",
    "contraindications": "The optimal daily dose of calcitriol capsules must be carefully determined for each patient. Calcitriol capsule can be administered orally as a capsule (0.25 mcg or 0.50 mcg). Calcitriol capsule therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of serum calcium.\n                  The effectiveness of calcitriol capsule therapy is predicated on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate but not excessive daily intake of calcium. Patients are advised to have a dietary intake of calcium at a minimum of 600 mg daily. The U.S. RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg to 1200 mg. To ensure that each patient receives an adequate daily intake of calcium, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct the patient in proper dietary measures.\n                  Because of improved calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, some patients on calcitriol capsule may be maintained on a lower calcium intake. Patients who tend to develop hypercalcemia may require only low doses of calcium or no supplementation at all.\n                  During the titration period of treatment with calcitriol, serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly. When the optimal dosage of calcitriol has been determined, serum calcium levels should be checked every month (or as given below for individual indications). Samples for serum calcium estimation should be taken without a tourniquet.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Capsules: 0.25 mcg calcitriol in soft gelatin, orange, oval capsules, imprinted with 673; bottles of 30 (NDC 23155-662-03), and bottles of 100 (NDC 23155-662-01).\n                  \n                     Capsules: 0.5 mcg calcitriol in soft gelatin, orange, oblong capsules, imprinted with 674; bottles of 100 (NDC 23155-663-01).\n                  Calcitriol Capsules should be protected from light.\n                  Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°C F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]",
    "adverseReactions": "Calcitriol should not be given to patients with hypercalcemia or evidence of vitamin D toxicity. Use of Calcitriol in patients with known hypersensitivity to Calcitriol (or drugs of the same class) or any of the inactive ingredients is contraindicated."
