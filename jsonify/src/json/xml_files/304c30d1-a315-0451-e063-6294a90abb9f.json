    "indications": "Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are indicated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication.",
    "contraindications": "Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets contain carbidopa and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio as either the 50 mg/200 mg tablet or the 25 mg/100 mg tablet. The daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release must be determined by careful titration. Patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period, particularly with regard to appearance or worsening of involuntary movements, dyskinesias or nausea. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should not be chewed or crushed.\n                  Standard drugs for Parkinson's disease, other than levodopa without a decarboxylase inhibitor, may be used concomitantly while carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is being administered, although their dosage may have to be adjusted.\n                  Since carbidopa prevents the reversal of levodopa effects caused by pyridoxine, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release can be given to patients receiving supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B\n \n  6).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Carbidopa and Levodopa Extended-release Tablets USP 50 mg/200 mg containing 50 mg of carbidopa and 200 mg of levodopa, are peach to light peach coloured with mosaic appearance, oval shaped biconvex, tablets, debossed with 'L200' on one side and breakline on other.

    "adverseReactions": "Nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are contraindicated for use with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. These inhibitors must be discontinued at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release may be administered concomitantly with the manufacturer's recommended dose of an MAO inhibitor with selectivity for MAO type B (e.g., selegiline HCl) (see\n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions\n                     ).\n\n \n                  Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of this drug, and in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma."
