Once a thrombus has occurred, however, the goals of anticoagulant treatment are to prevent further extension of the formed clot and to prevent secondary thromboembolic complications that may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae.",
    "contraindications": "Individualize dosing regimen for each patient, and adjust based on INR response. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Knowledge of genotype can inform initial dose selection. ( 2.3 ) Monitoring: Obtain daily INR determinations upon initiation until stable in the therapeutic range. Obtain subsequent INR determinations every 1 to 4 weeks.
