    "indications": "Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets are indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain, where treatment with an opioid is appropriate and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.\n                  Limitations of Use\n                  Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, with opioids, even at recommended doses (see WARNINGS), reserve acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics)\n                  Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia,\n                  Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated.",
    "contraindications": "Important Dosage and Administration Instructions\n                  Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).\n                  Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse (see WARNINGS).\n                  Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to\n  \n72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly (see WARNINGS).\n \n                  Initial Dosage\n                  Initiating Treatment with Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Tablets\n                  Dosage should be adjusted according to severity of pain and response of the patient. However, it should be kept in mind that tolerance to codeine can develop with continued use and that the incidence of untoward effects is dose related. Adult doses of codeine higher than 60 mg are associated with an increased incidence of adverse reactions and are not associated with greater efficacy.\n                  The usual adult dosage is:\n                  Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Tablets (codeine 15 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain.\n                  Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Tablets (codeine 30 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours as needed for pain.\n                  Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Tablets (codeine 60 mg and acetaminophen 300 mg): Take one tablet every 4 hours as needed for pain.\n                  Single Doses (Range)\n                  Maximum 24-Hour Dose\n                  Codeine Phosphate\n                  15 mg to 60 mg\n                  360 mg\n                  Acetaminophen\n                  300 mg to 1,000 mg\n                  4,000 mg\n                  The prescriber must determine the number of tablets per dose, and the maximum number of tablets per 24 hours, based upon the above dosage guidance. This information should be conveyed in the prescription.\n                  Conversion from Other Opioids to Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Tablets\n                  There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.\n                  Titration and Maintenance of Therapy\n                  Individually titrate acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse (see WARNINGS). Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.\n                  If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.\n                  Discontinuation of Acetaminophen and Codeine Phosphate Tablets\n                  When a patient who has been taking acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal. If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both. Do not abruptly discontinue acetaminophen and codeine phosphate tablets in a physically-dependent patient (see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).",
