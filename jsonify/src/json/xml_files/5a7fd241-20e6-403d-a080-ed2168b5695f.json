    "indications": "Estradiol gel 0.1% is an estrogen indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause (1.1).",
    "contraindications": "Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.Generally, a woman without a uterus, does not need a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].\n                      Use estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestogen, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine whether treatment is still necessary.",
