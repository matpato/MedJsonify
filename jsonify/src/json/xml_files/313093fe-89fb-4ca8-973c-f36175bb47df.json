    "indications": "DOTAREM is a gadolinium-based contrast agent indicated for intravenous use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in brain (intracranial), spine and associated tissues in adult and pediatric patients (including term neonates) to detect and visualize areas with disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and/or abnormal vascularity.",
    "contraindications": "Adult and pediatric patients: The recommended dose of DOTAREM is 0.2 mL/kg (0.1 mmol/kg) body weight administered as an intravenous bolus injection at a flow rate of approximately 2 mL/second for adults and 1 - 2 mL/second for pediatric patients (including term neonates). The dose is delivered by manual or power injection.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "DOTAREM Injection is a clear, colorless to yellow solution containing 0.5 mmol/mL of gadoterate meglumine.
