    "contraindications": "In adults with established CVD or with primary hyperlipidemia : The recommended dosage of REPATHA is either 140 mg every 2 weeks OR 420 mg once monthly administered subcutaneously. ( 2.1 ) If switching dosage regimens, administer the first dose of the new regimen on the next scheduled date of the prior regimen. ( 2.1 ) In pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with HeFH : The recommended dosage of REPATHA is either 140 mg every 2 weeks OR 420 mg once monthly administered subcutaneously. ( 2.1 ) If switching dosage regimens, administer the first dose of the new regimen on the next scheduled date of the prior regimen. ( 2.1 ) In adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with HoFH : The initial recommended dosage of REPATHA is 420 mg once monthly administered subcutaneously. ( 2.1 ) The dosage can be increased to 420 mg every 2 weeks if a clinically meaningful response is not achieved in 12 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Patients on lipid apheresis may initiate treatment with 420 mg every 2 weeks to correspond with their apheresis schedule. Administer REPATHA after the apheresis session is complete. ( 2.1 ) Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate. The LDL-lowering effect of REPATHA may be measured as early as 4 weeks after initiation. ( 2.1 ) REPATHA is available as prefilled single-dose SureClick ® autoinjectors and prefilled single-dose syringes that either contain dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex) in the needle cover or are not made with natural rubber latex. Consider prescribing a presentation of REPATHA that does not contain dry natural rubber for individuals that are sensitive to latex. ( 2.3 , 16 ) Administer REPATHA subcutaneously into areas of the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Rotate injection sites for each administration.
