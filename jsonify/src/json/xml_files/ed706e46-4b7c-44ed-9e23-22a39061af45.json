    "indications": "Travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.",
    "contraindications": "The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. Travoprost ophthalmic solution should not be administered more than once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may decrease the IOP lowering effect. \n                  Reduction of the IOP starts approximately 2 hours after the first administration with maximum effect reached after 12 hours.\n                  Travoprost ophthalmic solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower IOP. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.",
