    "contraindications": "Important Dosage and Administration Information: (2.1) Take ezetimibe and simvastatin orally once daily in the evening with or without food. Maximum recommended dosage is ezetimibe and simvastatin 10/40 mg once daily. Ezetimibe and simvastatin 10/80 mg daily dosage is restricted to patients who have been taking ezetimibe and simvastatin 10/80 mg daily chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity. For patients that require a high-intensity statin or are unable to achieve their LDL-C goal receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin 10/40 mg daily, prescribe alternative LDL-C-lowering treatment. If as dose is missed, take the missed dose as soon as possible. Do not double the next dose. Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate, as early as 2 weeks after initiating ezetimibe and simvastatin, and adjust the dosage if necessary. Adults: Recommended dosage range of 10/10 mg to 10/40 mg once daily. (2.2) See full prescribing information for ezetimibe and simvastatin dosage modifications due to drug interactions.
