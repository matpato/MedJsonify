    "contraindications": "See Full Prescribing Information for important administration instructions. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 ) Subcutaneous injection ( 2.2 ): Administer HUMALOG ® U-100 or U-200 by subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall, thigh, upper arm, or buttocks within 15 minutes before a meal or immediately after a meal. Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. Continuous subcutaneous infusion (Insulin Pump) ( 2.2 ): Refer to the insulin infusion pump user manual to see if HUMALOG can be used. Use in accordance with the insulin pump instructions for use. Administer HUMALOG U-100 by continuous subcutaneous infusion using an insulin pump in a region recommended in the instructions from the pump manufacturer. Rotate infusion sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis. DO NOT administer HUMALOG U-200 by continuous subcutaneous infusion. Intravenous Infusion ( 2.2 ): Administer HUMALOG U-100 by intravenous infusion ONLY after dilution and under medical supervision. DO NOT administer HUMALOG U-200 by intravenous infusion. The dosage of HUMALOG must be individualized based on the route of administration and the individual's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal. ( 2.3 ) Do not perform dose conversion when using the HUMALOG U-100 or U-200 prefilled pens. The dose window shows the number of insulin units to be delivered and no conversion is needed. ( 2.1 , 2.3 ) Do not mix HUMALOG U-200 with any other insulin. ( 2.4 )",
