    "indications": "To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "Not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Oral Suspension USP, containing 200 mg sulfamethoxazole and 40 mg trimethoprim per teaspoonful (5 mL), is a cherry flavored suspension available in:\n                  NDC 0121-0854-16: 16 fl oz (473 mL) bottle\n                  Store at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from light.\n                  SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING.\n                  Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP, with a child-resistant closure (as required).\n                  To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pharmaceutical Associates, Inc. at 1-800-845-8210 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.\n                  \n                     Rx only",
    "adverseReactions": "Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides, in patients with a history of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia with use of trimethoprim and/or sulfonamides, and in patients with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is also contraindicated in pregnant patients and nursing mothers, because sulfonamides pass the placenta and are excreted in the milk and may cause kernicterus. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is also contraindicated in patients with marked hepatic damage or with severe renal insufficiency when renal function status cannot be monitored."
