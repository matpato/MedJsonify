    "indications": "To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefdinir for oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, cefdinir for oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n                  Cefdinir for oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below.",

Once-daily dosing for 10 days is as effective as BID dosing. Once-daily dosing has not been studied in skin infections; therefore, cefdinir for oral suspension should be administered twice daily in this infection.
