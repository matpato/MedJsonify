    "indications": "Metolazone is indicated for the treatment of salt and water retention including:\n                  •  edema accompanying congestive heart failure;\n                  •  edema accompanying renal diseases, including the nephrotic syndrome and states of diminished renal function.\n                  Metolazone is also indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs of a different class. Mykrox\n \n  ®tablets, a more rapidly available form of metolazone, are intended for the treatment of new patients with mild to moderate hypertension.
