    "indications": "Tramadol hydrochloride tablets are indicated in adults for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.\n                  \n                     Limitations of Use\n                  \n                  Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses\n \n  [see\n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n \n  , reserve tramadol hydrochloride tablets for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics]:\n\n \n                  \n                     Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated.\n                     Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.",
    "contraindications": "Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals ( 2.1 ). Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk  for addiction, abuse, and misuse ( 2.1 ). Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24-72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with tramadol hydrochloride tablets and adjust the dosage accordingly ( 2.1 ). Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient's need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with tramadol hydrochloride tablets. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 5.3 , 5.7 ). Start at 25 mg/day and titrate in 25 mg increments as separate doses every 3 days to reach 100 mg/day (25 mg four times a day). Thereafter the total daily dose may be increased by 50 mg as tolerated every 3 days to reach 200 mg/day (50 mg four times a day). After titration, tramadol hydrochloride tablets 50 mg to 100 mg can be administered as needed for pain relief every 4 to 6 hours not to exceed 400 mg/day. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) Severe Renal Impairment: Increase the tramadol hydrochloride tablets dosing interval to 12 hours, and limit maximum daily dose to 200 mg ( 2.3 ). Severe hepatic impairment: Recommended dose is 50 mg every 12 hours. Do not abruptly discontinue tramadol hydrochloride tablets in a physically-dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide ( 2.3 ).",
