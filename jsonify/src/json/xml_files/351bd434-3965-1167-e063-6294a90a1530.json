    "indications": "Ursodiol Capsules are indicated for patients with radiolucent, noncalcified gallbladder stones < 20 mm in greatest diameter in whom elective cholecystectomy would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due to systemic disease, advanced age, idiosyncratic reaction to general anesthesia, or for those patients who refuse surgery. Safety of use of ursodiol capsules beyond 24 months is not established.\n                     Ursodiol capsules are indicated for the prevention of gallstone formation in obese patients experiencing rapid weight loss.",
    "contraindications": "Gallstone Dissolution\n                        The recommended dose for ursodiol capsules treatment of radiolucent gallbladder stones is 8 - 10 mg/kg/day given in 2 or 3 divided doses.\n\n \n                  Ultrasound images of the gallbladder should be obtained at 6-month intervals for the first year of ursodiol capsules therapy to monitor gallstone response. If gallstones appear to have dissolved, ursodiol capsules therapy should be continued and dissolution confirmed on a repeat ultrasound examination within 1 to 3 months. Most patients who eventually achieve complete stone dissolution will show partial or complete dissolution at the first on-treatment reevaluation. If partial stone dissolution is not seen by 12 months of Ursodiol capsules therapy, the likelihood of success is greatly reduced.\n                  \n                     Gallstone Prevention\n                       The recommended dosage of ursodiol capsules for gallstone prevention in patients undergoing rapid weight loss is 600 mg/day (300 mg b.i.d.).",
