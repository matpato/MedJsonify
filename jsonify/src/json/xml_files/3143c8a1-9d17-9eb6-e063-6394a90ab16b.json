The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it may be necessary to increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily.\n                  If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to a tolerated dose and OBSERVE THE PATIENT CLOSELY.\n                  If severe adverse reactions occur, STOP THE DRUG. After the acute phase of the disease is under control, an attempt to reduce the daily dose should be made repeatedly until the patient is receiving the smallest effective dose or the drug is discontinued.\n                  Careful instructions to, and observations of, the individual patient are essential to the prevention of serious, irreversible, including fatal, adverse reactions.\n                  As advancing years appear to increase the possibility of adverse reactions, indomethacin should be used with greater care in the elderly [see \n                        \n       \n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS\n                     , \n       \n \n  \n                        \n                           Geriatric Use\n                        \n                     ].\n      \n\n \n                  2.

The usual course of therapy is 7-14 days.\n                  3.

The dose should then be rapidly reduced to complete cessation of the drug. Definite relief of pain has been reported within 2 to 4 hours.\n                  Tenderness and heat usually subside in 24 to 36 hours, and swelling gradually disappears in 3 to 5 days.",
