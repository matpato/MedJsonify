    "indications": "Haloperidol injection is indicated for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.",
    "contraindications": "There is considerable variation from patient to patient in the amount of medication required for treatment.  As with all drugs used to treat schizophrenia, dosage should be individualized according to the needs and response of each patient.  Dosage adjustments, either upward or downward, should be carried out as rapidly as practicable to achieve optimum therapeutic control.\n\n                  To determine the initial dosage, consideration should be given to the patient's age, severity of illness, previous response to other antipsychotic drugs, and any concomitant medication or disease state. Debilitated or geriatric patients, as well as those with a history of adverse reactions to antipsychotic drugs, may require less haloperidol injection.  The optimal response in such patients is usually obtained with more gradual dosage adjustments and at lower dosage levels.\n\n                  Parenteral medication, administered intramuscularly in doses of 2 to 5 mg, is utilized for prompt control of the acutely agitated schizophrenic patient with moderately severe to very severe symptoms. Depending on the response of the patient, subsequent doses may be given, administered as often as every hour, although 4 to 8 hour intervals may be satisfactory.  The maximum dose is 20 mg/day.\n\n                  Controlled trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of intramuscular administration in children have not been conducted.\n\n                  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",
