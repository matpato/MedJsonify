    "indications": "Adjunctive therapy for the treatment of peptic ulcer.\n                  METHSCOPOLAMINE BROMIDE HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE HEALING OF PEPTIC ULCER, DECREASING THE RATE OF RECURRENCE OR PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS.",
    "contraindications": "The average dosage of Methscopolamine Bromide Tablets, USP is 2.5 mg one-half hour before meals and 2.5 to 5 mg at bedtime. A starting dose of 12.5 mg daily will be clinically effective in most patients without the production of appreciable side effects.\n                  If the patient is experiencing symptoms such as severe abdominal pain or cramping which demand prompt relief, the drug may be started on a daily dosage of 20 mg, administered in doses of 5 mg one-half hour before meals and at bedtime. If very unpleasant side effects develop promptly, the daily dosage should be reduced. If neither symptomatic relief nor side effects appear, the daily dosage may be increased. Some patients have tolerated 30 mg daily with no unpleasant reactions.\n                  Patients whose dosage has been reduced to eliminate or modify side effects often continue to show adequate response both subjectively in relief of symptoms and objectively as measured by antisecretory effects.\n                  The ultimate aim of therapy is to arrive at a dosage which provides maximal clinical effectiveness with a minimum of unpleasant side effects. Many patients report no side effects on a dosage which gives complete relief of symptoms. On the other hand, some patients have reported severe side effects without appreciable symptomatic relief. Such patients must be considered unsuited for this therapy. Usually they have been or will prove to be similarly intolerant to other anticholinergic drugs. If methscopolamine bromide is to be used in a patient who gives a history of such intolerance, it should be started at a low dosage.",
