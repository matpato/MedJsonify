    "contraindications": "Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution 20 mg/mL is only for opioid-tolerant adult patients . ( 2.1 ) Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.2 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.2 , 5 ) Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.2 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient’s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose. ( 2.3 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 ). Adults: Initiate treatment with Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution 10 mg to 20 mg every 4 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution. ( 2.4 , 2.5 ) Pediatric Patients 2 Years of Age and Older: Initiate treatment with Morphine Oral Solution 2 mg/mL or 4 mg/mL at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg every 4 hours as needed for pain, and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Do not exceed 20 mg as an initial dose in pediatrics. See Full Prescribing Information for complete information on pediatric dosing. ( 2.3 ) Do not abruptly discontinue Morphine Sulfate Oral Solution in a physically dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide.
