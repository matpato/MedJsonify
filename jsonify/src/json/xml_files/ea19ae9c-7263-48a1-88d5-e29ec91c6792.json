    "indications": "Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are indicated for the treatment of tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures and prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during or following neurosurgery.",
    "contraindications": "Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustmentsâ€”the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL).
