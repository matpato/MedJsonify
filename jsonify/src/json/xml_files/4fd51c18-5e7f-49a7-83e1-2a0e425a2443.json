    "indications": "Milrinone Lactate Injection, USP and Milrinone Lactate in 5% Dextrose Injection are indicated for the short-term intravenous treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Patients receiving milrinone should be observed closely with appropriate electrocardiographic equipment. The facility for immediate treatment of potential cardiac events, which may include life threatening ventricular arrhythmias, must be available. The majority of experience with intravenous milrinone has been in patients receiving digoxin and diuretics. There is no experience in controlled trials with infusions of milrinone for periods exceeding 48 hours.",

To use the Flexible Container, tear the overwrap at the notch and remove the Pre-Mix solution container. Squeeze the container firmly to check for leaks. Discard the container if leaks are found since the sterility of the product could be affected. Do not add supplementary medication.\n                  To prepare the container for administration of milrinone intravenously, use aseptic techniques.1. The flow control clamp of the administration set is closed.2. The cover of the outlet port at the bottom of the container is removed.3. Noting the full directions on the administration set carton, the piercing pin of the set is inserted into the port with a twisting motion until it is firmly sealed.4. The container is suspended on the hanger.5. The drop chamber is squeezed and released to establish the fill level.6. The flow control clamp is opened to expel air from the set and then closed.7. The set is attached to the venipuncture device, primed, and if not indwelling, the venipuncture is performed.8. The rate of administration is controlled with the flow control clamp.
