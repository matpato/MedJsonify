Furosemide is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.\n                  \n                     Hypertension\n                  \n                  Oral furosemide may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with furosemide alone.",
    "contraindications": "Edema \n                  \n                  Therapy should be individualized according to patient response to gain maximal therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose needed to maintain that response.\n                  \n                     \n                        Adults\n                     \n                  \n                  The usual initial dose of oral furosemide is 20 to 80 mg given as a single dose. Ordinarily a prompt diuresis ensues. If needed, the same dose can be administered 6 to 8 hours later or the dose may be increased. The dose may be raised by 20 or 40 mg and given not sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose until the desired diuretic effect has been obtained. The individually determined single dose should then be given once or twice daily (e.g., at 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.). The dose of furosemide may be carefully titrated up to 600 mg/day in patients with clinically severe edematous states.\n                  Edema may be most efficiently and safely mobilized by giving furosemide on 2 to 4 consecutive days each week.\n                  When doses exceeding 80 mg/day are given for prolonged periods, careful clinical observation and laboratory monitoring are particularly advisable (see\n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests\n                     ).\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                        Geriatric Patients\n                     \n                  \n                  In general, dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see\n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use\n                     ).\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                        Pediatric Patients\n                     \n                  \n                  The usual initial dose of oral furosemide in pediatric patients is 2 mg/kg body weight given as a single dose. If the diuretic response is not satisfactory after the initial dose, dosage may be increased by 1 or 2 mg/kg no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after the previous dose. Doses greater than 6 mg/kg body weight are not recommended.

Dosage should then be adjusted according to response. If response is not satisfactory, add other antihypertensive agents.\n                  Changes in blood pressure must be carefully monitored when furosemide is used with other antihypertensive drugs, especially during initial therapy. To prevent excessive drop in blood pressure, the dosage of other agents should be reduced by at least 50 percent when furosemide is added to the regimen. As the blood pressure falls under the potentiating effect of furosemide, a further reduction in dosage or even discontinuation of other antihypertensive drugs may be necessary.\n                  \n                     \n                        Geriatric Patients\n                     \n                  \n                  In general, dose selection and dose adjustment for the elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range (see\n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use\n                     ).",
