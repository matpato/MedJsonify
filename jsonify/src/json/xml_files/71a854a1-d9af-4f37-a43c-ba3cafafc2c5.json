    "indications": "LOMAIRA™ tablets are indicated as a short-term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on exercise, behavioral modification and caloric restriction in the management of exogenous obesity in patients with an initial body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m\n \n  2, or greater than or equal to 27 kg/m\n \n  2in the presence of other risk factors (e.g., controlled hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia).\n\n \n                  Below is a chart of body mass index (BMI) based on various heights and weights.\n                  BMI is calculated by taking the patient’s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient’s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds ÷ 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters.\n                  BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), kg/m\n \n  2\n                  \n                  \n                     \n                  \n                  The limited usefulness of agents of this class, including phentermine (see\n \n  \n                        Clinical Pharmacology\n                     ), should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.",

This tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose. Phentermine hydrochloride is not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than or equal to 16 years of age.\n \n                  Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.",
