    "indications": "AMPYRA is indicated as a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed [see Clinical Studies (14)].",
    "contraindications": "The maximum recommended dosage is 10 mg twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart). There is no evidence of additional benefit with doses greater than 10 mg twice daily. Adverse reactions, including seizures, were more frequent at higher doses. ( 2.1 ) Take with or without food. Administer tablets whole; do not divide, crush, chew, or dissolve ( 2.2 ) Patients should not take double or extra doses if they miss a dose. ( 2.2 ) Estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be known before initiating treatment with AMPYRA. In patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 51–80 mL/min), AMPYRA may reach plasma levels associated with a greater risk of seizures, and the potential benefits of AMPYRA should be carefully considered against the risk of seizures in these patients ( 2.3 , 5.2 , 8.6 )",
