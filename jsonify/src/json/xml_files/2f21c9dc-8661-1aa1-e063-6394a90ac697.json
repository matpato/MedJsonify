Below is a chart of BMI based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient’s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient’s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds divided by 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters.\n\n \n                  \n                     Body Mass Index (BMI), kg/m\n  \n   2\n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           Weight (pounds)\n                           Height (feet, inches)\n                        \n                        \n                           5’0”\n                           5’3”\n                           5’6”\n                           5’9”\n                           6’0”\n                           6’3”\n                        \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           140\n                           27\n                           25\n                           23\n                           21\n                           19\n                           18\n                        \n                        \n                           150\n                           29\n                           27\n                           24\n                           22\n                           20\n                           19\n                        \n                        \n                           160\n                           31\n                           28\n                           26\n                           24\n                           22\n                           20\n                        \n                        \n                           170\n                           33\n                           30\n                           28\n                           25\n                           23\n                           21\n                        \n                        \n                           180\n                           35\n                           32\n                           29\n                           27\n                           25\n                           23\n                        \n                        \n                           190\n                           37\n                           34\n                           31\n                           28\n                           26\n                           24\n                        \n                        \n                           200\n                           39\n                           36\n                           32\n                           30\n                           27\n                           25\n                        \n                        \n                           210\n                           41\n                           37\n                           34\n                           31\n                           29\n                           26\n                        \n                        \n                           220\n                           43\n                           39\n                           36\n                           33\n                           30\n                           28\n                        \n                        \n                           230\n                           45\n                           41\n                           37\n                           34\n                           31\n                           29\n                        \n                        \n                           240\n                           47\n                           43\n                           39\n                           36\n                           33\n                           30\n                        \n                        \n                           250\n                           49\n                           44\n                           40\n                           37\n                           34\n                           31\n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  The usefulness of agents of this class (see\n \n  \n                        CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n                     ) should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use such as those described below.
