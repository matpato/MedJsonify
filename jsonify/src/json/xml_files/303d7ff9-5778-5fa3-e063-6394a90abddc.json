    "adverseReactions": "Carbamazepine should not be used in patients with a history of previous bone marrow depression, hypersensitivity to the drug, or known sensitivity to any of the tricyclic compounds, such as amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, protriptyline, nortriptyline, etc. Likewise, on theoretical grounds its use with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors is not recommended. Before administration of carbamazepine, MAO inhibitors should be dis continued for a minimum of 14 days, or longer if the clinical situation permits.\n                  Coadministration of carbamazepine and nefazodone may result in insufficient plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite to achieve a therapeutic effect.  Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated."
