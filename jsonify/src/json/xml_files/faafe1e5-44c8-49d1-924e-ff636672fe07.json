    "indications": "Phenelzine sulfate has been found to be effective in depressed patients clinically characterized as \"atypical,\" \"nonendogenous,\" or \"neurotic.\" These patients often have mixed anxiety and depression and phobic or hypochondriacal features. There is less conclusive evidence of its usefulness with severely depressed patients with endogenous features.\n                  Phenelzine sulfate should rarely be the first antidepressant drug used. Rather, it is more suitable for use with patients who have failed to respond to the drugs more commonly used for these conditions.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Each phenelzine sulfate tablet is orange, biconvex, film-coated, and engraved with \"P-D 270\" and contains phenelzine sulfate equivalent to 15 mg of phenelzine base.\n                  NDC 59762-0119-1. Bottle of 60",
    "adverseReactions": "Phenelzine sulfate should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients, with pheochromocytoma, congestive heart failure, severe renal impairment or renal disease, a history of liver disease, or abnormal liver function tests.\n                  The potentiation of sympathomimetic substances and related compounds by MAO inhibitors may result in hypertensive crises (see WARNINGS). Therefore, patients being treated with phenelzine sulfate should not take sympathomimetic drugs (including amphetamines, cocaine, methylphenidate, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) or related compounds (including methyldopa, L-dopa, L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine, and phenylalanine). Hypertensive crises during phenelzine sulfate therapy may also be caused by the ingestion of foods with a high concentration of tyramine or dopamine. Therefore, patients being treated with phenelzine sulfate should avoid high protein food that has undergone protein breakdown by aging, fermentation, pickling, smoking, or bacterial contamination. Patients should also avoid cheeses (especially aged varieties), pickled herring, beer, wine, liver, yeast extract (including brewer's yeast in large quantities), dry sausage (including Genoa salami, hard salami, pepperoni, and Lebanon bologna), pods of broad beans (fava beans), and yogurt. Excessive amounts of caffeine and chocolate may also cause hypertensive reactions.\n                  Phenelzine sulfate should not be used in combination with dextromethorphan or with CNS depressants such as alcohol and certain narcotics. Excitation, seizures, delirium, hyperpyrexia, circulatory collapse, coma, and death have been reported in patients receiving MAOI therapy who have been given a single dose of meperidine. Phenelzine sulfate should not be administered together with or in rapid succession to other MAO inhibitors because HYPERTENSIVE CRISES and convulsive seizures, fever, marked sweating, excitation, delirium, tremor, coma, and circulatory collapse may occur.\n                  Concomitant use with meperidine is contraindicated (see WARNINGS).\n                  \n                     \n                        A List of MAO Inhibitors by Generic Name Follows:\n                     \n                  \n                  pargyline hydrochloridepargyline hydrochloride and methylclothiazidefurazolidoneisocarboxazidprocarbazinetranylcypromine\n                  Phenelzine sulfate should also not be used in combination with buspirone HCl, since several cases of elevated blood pressure have been reported in patients taking MAO inhibitors who were then given buspirone HCl. At least 14 days should elapse between the discontinuation of phenelzine sulfate and the institution of another antidepressant or buspirone HCl, or the discontinuation of another MAO inhibitor and the institution of phenelzine sulfate.\n                  There have been reports of serious reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonic movements and death) when serotoninergic drugs (e.g., dexfenfluramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, venlafaxine) have been combined with an MAO inhibitor. Therefore, the concomitant use of phenelzine sulfate with serotoninergic agents is contraindicated (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions). At least 14 days should elapse between the discontinuation of an MAO inhibitor and the start of a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor or vice-versa, with the exception of fluoxetine. Allow at least five weeks between discontinuation of fluoxetine and initiation of phenelzine sulfate and at least 14 days between discontinuation of phenelzine sulfate and initiation of fluoxetine, or other serotoninergic agents. Before initiating phenelzine sulfate after using other serotoninergic agents, a sufficient amount of time must be allowed for clearance of the serotoninergic agent and its active metabolites.\n                  The combination of MAO inhibitors and tryptophan has been reported to cause behavioral and neurologic syndromes including disorientation, confusion, amnesia, delirium, agitation, hypomanic signs, ataxia, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, shivering, ocular oscillations, and Babinski signs.\n                  The concurrent administration of an MAO inhibitor and bupropion hydrochloride (WellbutrinÂ®) is contraindicated. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAO inhibitor and initiation of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride.\n                  Patients taking phenelzine sulfate should not undergo elective surgery requiring general anesthesia. Also, they should not be given cocaine or local anesthesia containing sympathomimetic vasoconstrictors. The possible combined hypotensive effects of phenelzine sulfate and spinal anesthesia should be kept in mind. Phenelzine sulfate should be discontinued at least 10 days prior to elective surgery.\n                  MAO inhibitors, including phenelzine sulfate, are contraindicated in patients receiving guanethidine.",
