    "contraindications": "•  Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. (2.1) •  OA: 200 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily.

(2.4, 14.3) •  AS: 200 mg once daily single dose or 100 mg twice daily. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg (single or divided doses) may be of benefit. (2.5, 14.4) •  AP and PD: 400 mg initially, followed by 200 mg dose if needed on first day. On subsequent days, 200 mg twice daily as needed. (2.6, 14.5) Hepatic Impairment: Reduce daily dose by 50% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). (2.7, 8.6, 12.3) Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates: Consider a dose reduction by 50% (or alternative management for JRA) in patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers.
