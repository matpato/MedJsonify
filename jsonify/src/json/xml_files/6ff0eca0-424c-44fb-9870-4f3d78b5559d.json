    "contraindications": "Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals. ( 2.1 ) OA: 200 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily. ( 2.2 , 14.1 ) RA: 100 mg to 200 mg twice daily. ( 2.3 , 14.2 ) JRA: 50 mg twice daily in patients 10 kg to 25 kg. 100 mg twice daily in patients more than 25 kg. ( 2.4 , 14.3 ) AS: 200 mg once daily single dose or 100 mg twice daily. If no effect is observed after 6 weeks, a trial of 400 mg (single or divided doses) may be of benefit. ( 2.5 , 14.4 ) AP and PD: 400 mg initially, followed by 200 mg dose if needed on first day. On subsequent days, 200 mg twice daily as needed. ( 2.6 , 14.5 ) Hepatic Impairment: Reduce daily dose by 50% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). ( 2.7 , 8.6 , 12.3 ). Poor Metabolizers of CYP2C9 Substrates: Consider a dose reduction by 50% (or alternative management for JRA) in patients who are known or suspected to be CYP2C9 poor metabolizers ( 2.7 , 8.8 , 12.3 ).",
