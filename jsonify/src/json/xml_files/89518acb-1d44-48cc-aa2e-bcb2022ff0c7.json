    "indications": "TRAVATAN Z® (travoprost ophthalmic solution) 0.004% is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.",
    "contraindications": "The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. TRAVATAN Z  should not be administered more than once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may decrease the IOP-lowering effect.\n                  Reduction of the IOP starts approximately 2 hours after the first administration with maximum effect reached after 12 hours.\n                  TRAVATAN Z may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower IOP. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least 5 minutes apart.",
