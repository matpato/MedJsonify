    "indications": "JANUMET is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n                  \n                     Limitations of Use\n                  \n                  JANUMET should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n                  JANUMET has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUMET. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).]",
    "contraindications": "Take JANUMET orally twice daily with meals. ( 2.1 ) Individualize the dosage of JANUMET on the basis of the patient’s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. ( 2.1 ) The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2000 mg of metformin HCl. ( 2.1 ) The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. ( 2.1 ) The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl twice daily. ( 2.1 ) Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ( 2.2 ) Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures.
