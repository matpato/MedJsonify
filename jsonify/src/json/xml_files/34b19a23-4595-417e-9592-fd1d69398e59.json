    "indications": "Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist indicated for: • The treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). • Use as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). • The management of edema in adult patients who are cirrhotic when edema is not responsive to fluid and sodium restrictions and in the setting of nephrotic syndrome when treatment of the underlying disease, restriction of fluid and sodium intake, and the use of other diuretics produce an inadequate response ( 1.3 ). • Treatment of primary hyperaldosteronism for: ( 1.4 ) o Short-term preoperative treatment o Long-term maintenance for patients with discrete aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas who are not candidates for surgery and patients with bilateral micro or macronodular adrenal hyperplasia",
    "contraindications": "• Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). • Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). • Edema:  Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly.  The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ). • Primary hyperaldosteronism:  Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery.  In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient ( Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. ).",
