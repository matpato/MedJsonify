    "indications": "For control of severe nausea and vomiting.\n                  \n                  For the treatment of schizophrenia.\n                  \n                  Prochlorperazine is effective for the short-term treatment of generalized non-psychotic anxiety. However, prochlorperazine is not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines).\n                  \n                  When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, prochlorperazine should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks, because the use of prochlorperazine at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see\n \n  \n                        WARNINGS\n                     ).\n\n \n                  \n                  The effectiveness of prochlorperazine as treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. This evidence does not predict that prochlorperazine will be useful in patients with other non-psychotic conditions in which anxiety, or signs that mimic anxiety, are found (e.g., physical illness, organic mental conditions, agitated depression, character pathologies, etc.).\n                  \n                   Prochlorperazine has not been shown effective in the management of behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation.",
    "contraindications": "(For children’s dosage and administration, see below.) Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients.\n                  \n                  \n                     Elderly Patients:In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully monitored and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     1.To Control Severe Nausea and Vomiting:\n                  \n                  Adjust dosage to the response of the individual. Begin with the lowest recommended dosage.\n                  \n                     Oral Dosage-Tablets:Usually one 5mg or 10mg tablet 3 or 4 times daily.

In Adult Psychiatric Disorders:Adjust dosage to the response of the individual and according to the severity of the condition. Begin with the lowest recommended dose. Although response ordinarily is seen within a day or 2, longer treatment is usually required before maximal improvement is seen.\n\n \n                  \n                     Oral Dosage:Non-Psychotic Anxiety--Usual dosage is 5 mg 3 or 4 times daily. Do not administer in doses of more than 20mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks.\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     Psychotic Disorders including Schizophrenia--\n \n  In relatively mild conditions, as seen in private psychiatric practice or in outpatient clinics, dosage is 5 or 10 mg 3 or 4 times daily.\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     In moderate to severe conditions,for hospitalized or adequately supervised patients, usual starting dosage is 10 mg 3 or 4 times daily. Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are controlled or side effects become bothersome. When dosage is increased by small increments every 2 or 3 days, side effects either do not occur or are easily controlled.
