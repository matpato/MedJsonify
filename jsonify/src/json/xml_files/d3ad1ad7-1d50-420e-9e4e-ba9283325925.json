    "indications": "Methenamine hippurate tablets are indicated for prophylactic or suppressive treatment of frequently recurring urinary tract infections when long-term therapy is considered necessary. This drug should only be used after eradication of the infection by other appropriate antimicrobial agents.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of methenamine hippurate tablets and other antibacterial drugs, methenamine hippurate tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "1 tablet (1 g) twice daily (morning and night) for adults and pediatric patients over 12 years of age. 1/2 to 1 tablet (0.5 g to 1 g) twice daily (morning and night) for pediatric patients 6 years to 12 years of age. Since the antibacterial activity of methenamine hippurate tablets is greater in acid urine, restriction of alkalinizing foods and medications is desirable. If necessary, as indicated by urinary pH and clinical response, supplemental acidification of the urine should be instituted. The efficacy of therapy should be monitored by repeated urine cultures.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Methenamine hippurate tablets, USP are white to off-white colored, modified capsule-shaped, uncoated tablets, debossed with \"II\" and \"C\" on one side and score line on both the sides. \n                  NDC 72578-175-01 in bottle of 100 tablets with child-resistant closure\n                  Store at 20°C to 25°C (68ºF to 77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature].\n                  Dispense in well-closed, light-resistant container with child-resistant closure.",
    "adverseReactions": "Methenamine hippurate tablets are contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, or severe dehydration. Methenamine preparations should not be given to patients taking sulfonamides because some sulfonamides may form an insoluble precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine."
