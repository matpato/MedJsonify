    "indications": "RELEUKO is a leukocyte growth factor indicated to: Decrease the incidence of infection‚ as manifested by febrile neutropenia‚ in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti- cancer drugs associated with a significant incidence of severe neutropenia with fever. ( 1.1 ) Reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). ( 1.2 ) Reduce the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related clinical sequelae‚ e.g.‚ febrile neutropenia, in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). ( 1.3 ) Mobilize autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis ( 1.4 ) Reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of severe neutropenia (e.g., fever‚ infections‚ oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia‚ cyclic neutropenia‚ or idiopathic neutropenia. ( 1.5 ) Increase survival in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) ( 1.6 )",
    "contraindications": "Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy for AML. Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection, short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or continuous intravenous infusion. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.1 ) Patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration. ( 2.2 ) Patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.3 ) Administer for at least 4 days before first leukapheresis procedure and continue until last leukapheresis ( 2.3 ) Patients with congenital neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 6 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection twice daily ( 2.4 ) Patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection daily ( 2.4 ) Patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.5 ) Direct administration of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) using RELEUKO prefilled syringe is not recommended due to potential for dosing errors.
