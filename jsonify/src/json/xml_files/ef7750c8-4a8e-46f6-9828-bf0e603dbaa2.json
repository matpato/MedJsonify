    "indications": "Fluconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of: \n                  \n                     \n                        1.Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida). \n                     \n                        2.Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, fluconazole tablets were also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia. \n                     \n                        3.Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing fluconazole tablets for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see \n                           CLINICAL STUDIES\n                         section. Studies comparing fluconazole tablets to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted. \n                  \n                  Prophylaxis: Fluconazole tablets are also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. \n                  Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.",
    "contraindications": "Dosage and Administration in Adults: \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     Single Dose \n                  \n                  \n                     Vaginal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose. \n                  \n                     Multiple Dose \n                  \n                  SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF FLUCONAZOLE IS THE SAME FOR ORAL TABLETS AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy. \n                  The daily dose of fluconazole for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient’s response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. \n                  \n                     Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse. \n                  \n                     Esophageal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient’s response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms. \n                  \n                     Systemic Candida infections: For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used. \n                  \n                     Urinary tract infections and peritonitis: For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50 to 200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients. \n                  \n                     Cryptococcal meningitis: The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient’s response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of fluconazole for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily.\n                  \n                     Prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation: The recommended fluconazole daily dosage for the prevention of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation is 400 mg, once daily. Patients who are anticipated to have severe granulocytopenia (less than 500 neutrophils cells/mm3) should start fluconazole prophylaxis several days before the anticipated onset of neutropenia, and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 1000 cells/mm3.\n                  \n                     \n                        Dosage and Administration in Pediatric Patient:\n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis in pediatric patients 6 months and older is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Treatment should be administered for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.\n                  \n                     Esophageal candidiasis: For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, the recommended dosage of fluconazole in pediatric patients 6 months and older is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily.

The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. For suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in pediatric patients with AIDS, the recommended dose of fluconazole is 6 mg/kg once daily.\n                  \n                     \n                        Dosage in Patients with Impaired Renal Function: \n                     \n                  \n                  Fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug. There is no need to adjust single dose therapy for vaginal candidiasis because of impaired renal function. In patients with impaired renal function who will receive multiple doses of fluconazole, an initial loading dose of 50 mg to 400 mg should be given. After the loading dose, the daily dose (according to indication) should be based on the following summary: \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    Creatinine Clearance (mL/min)\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 \n                                    Recommended Dose (%)\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              >50\n                           \n                           \n                              100\n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              ≤50 (no dialysis)\n                           \n                           \n                              50\n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              Hemodialysis\n                           \n                           \n                              100% after each hemodialysis\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Patients on hemodialysis should receive 100% of the recommended dose after each hemodialysis; on non-dialysis days, patients should receive a reduced dose according to their creatinine clearance.\n                  These are suggested dose adjustments based on pharmacokinetics following administration of multiple doses.

There is no information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between fluconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used in prescribing fluconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles. Coadministration of other drugs known to prolong the QT interval and which are metabolized via the enzyme CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, pimozide, and quinidine are contraindicated in patients receiving fluconazole (see \n                        CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies\n                     and \n                        PRECAUTIONS)."
