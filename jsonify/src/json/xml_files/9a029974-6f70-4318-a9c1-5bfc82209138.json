    "indications": "ZUBSOLV is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence.  ZUBSOLV should be used as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support.",
    "contraindications": "Following induction, ZUBSOLV is administered sublingually as a single daily dose. ( 2.1 ) Strongly consider prescribing naloxone at the time ZUBSOLV is initiated or renewed because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose. ( 2.2 ) To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with ZUBSOLV should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident and Zubsolv should be administered in divided doses when used as initial treatment. ( 2.3 ) For patients dependent on short-acting opioid products who are in opioid withdrawal; on Day 1, administer up to 5.7 mg/1.4 mg of Zubsolv (in divided doses). On Day 2, administer up to a total dose of 11.4 mg/2.9 mg of Zubsolv as a single dose. ( 2.3 ) For patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products, induction onto sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended on Days 1 and 2 of treatment. ( 2.3 ) For maintenance treatment, the target dosage of ZUBSOLV is 11.4 mg/2.9 mg as a single daily dose. ( 2.4 ) Administer Zubsolv as directed in the Full Prescribing Information. ( 2.5 ) When discontinuing treatment, gradually taper to avoid signs and symptoms of withdrawal. ( 2.8 )",
