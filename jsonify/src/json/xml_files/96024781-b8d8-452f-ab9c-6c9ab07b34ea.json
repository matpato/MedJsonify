    "indications": "This fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of edema or hypertension except in individuals in whom the development of hypokalemia cannot be risked.\n                  \n                  \n                      \n                      Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are indicated for the treatment of hypertension or edema in patients who develop hypokalemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone. \n                   Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules are also indicated for those patients who require a thiazide diuretic and in whom the development of hypokalemia cannot be risked. \n                   Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules may be used alone or as an adjunct to other antihypertensive drugs, such as beta-blockers. Since triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules may enhance the action of these agents, dosage adjustments may be necessary.\n                  \n                  \n                     Usage in Pregnancy:\n                      The routine use of diuretics in an otherwise healthy woman is inappropriate and exposes mother and fetus to unnecessary hazard. Diuretics do not prevent development of toxemia of pregnancy, and there is no satisfactory evidence that they are useful in the treatment of developed toxemia. Edema during pregnancy may arise from pathological causes or from the physiologic and mechanical consequences of pregnancy. Diuretics are indicated in pregnancy when edema is due to pathologic causes, just as they are in the absence of pregnancy. Dependent edema in pregnancy resulting from restriction of venous return by the expanded uterus is properly treated through elevation of the lower extremities and use of support hose; use of diuretics to lower intravascular volume in this case is illogical and unnecessary. There is hypervolemia during normal pregnancy which is harmful to neither the fetus nor the mother (in the absence of cardiovascular disease), but which is associated with edema, including generalized edema in the majority of pregnant women. If this edema produces discomfort, increased recumbency will often provide relief. In rare instances this edema may cause extreme discomfort which is not relieved by rest. In these cases, a short course of diuretics may provide relief and may be appropriate.",
    "contraindications": "The usual dose of Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules, USP is 1 or 2 capsules given once daily, with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium and of the clinical effect (see WARNINGS, Hyperkalemia).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules, USP containing 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 37.5 mg triamterene.

    "adverseReactions": "Antikaliuretic Therapy and Potassium Supplementation:\n                      Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide should not be given to patients receiving other potassium-sparing agents such as spironolactone, amiloride, or other formulations containing triamterene. Concomitant potassium-containing salt substitutes should also not be used. Potassium supplementation should not be used with triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules except in severe cases of hypokalemia. Such concomitant therapy can be associated with rapid increases in serum potassium levels. If potassium supplementation is used, careful monitoring of the serum potassium level is necessary.\n                  \n                  \n                     Impaired Renal Function:\n                      Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients with anuria, acute and chronic renal insufficiency, or significant renal impairment.\n                  \n                  \n                     Hypersensitivity:\n                      Hypersensitivity to either drug in the preparation or to other sulfonamide-derived drugs is a contraindication.\n                  \n                  \n                     Hyperkalemia:\n                      Triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide  should not be used in patients with pre-existing elevated serum potassium."
