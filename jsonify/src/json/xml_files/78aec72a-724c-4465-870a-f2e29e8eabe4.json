    "indications": "Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, respectively. When used judiciously it effectively prevents and controls the convulsions of eclampsia without producing deleterious depression of the central nervous system of the mother or infant. However, other effective drugs are available for this purpose.",
    "contraindications": "Magnesium Sulfate in Water for Injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate.\n                  \n                     Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5-7 days can cause fetal abnormalities.",
