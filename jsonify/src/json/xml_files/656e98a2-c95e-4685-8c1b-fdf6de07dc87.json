    "indications": "Finasteride tablets are indicated for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) in MEN ONLY.\n                     Efficacy in bitemporal recession has not been established.\n                      Finasteride tablets are not indicated for use in women.",
    "contraindications": "Finasteride tablets may be administered with or without meals.\n                     The recommended dose of finasteride is one tablet (1 mg) taken once daily.\n                     In general, daily use for three months or more is necessary before benefit is observed. Continued use is recommended to sustain benefit, which should be re-evaluated periodically. Withdrawal of treatment leads to reversal of effect within 12 months.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Finasteride Tablets USP, 1 mg are white colored, octagonal, biconvex, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘J’ on one side and ‘81’ on the other side.\n                     Bottles of 30                           NDC 68788-6875-3\n                  Bottles of 60                           NDC 68788-6875-6\n                  Bottles of 90                           NDC 68788-6875-9\n                     \n                     \n                      Storage and Handling\n                     \n                      \n                     \n                     Store at 20º to 25ºC (68º to 77ºF) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Keep container closed and protect from moisture. \n                      Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets are not broken or crushed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].",
    "adverseReactions": "Finasteride tablets are contraindicated in the following:\n                  \n                     \n                        •Pregnancy. Finasteride use is contraindicated in women when they are or may potentially be pregnant. Because of the ability of Type II 5α-reductase inhibitors to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), finasteride may cause abnormalities of the external genitalia of a male fetus of a pregnant woman who receives finasteride. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while taking this drug, the pregnant woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the male fetus. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) and Patient Counseling Information (17).] In female rats, low doses of finasteride administered during pregnancy have produced abnormalities of the external genitalia in male offspring. \n                     \n                        •Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication."
