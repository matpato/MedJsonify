    "indications": "Metronidazole vaginal gel is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as\n \n  Haemophilusvaginitis,\n \n  Gardnerellavaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis,\n \n  Corynebacteriumvaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis).\n\n \n                  \n                     NOTE For purposes of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a \"fishy\" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent\n \n  Lactobacillusmorphology, (b) predominance of\n \n  Gardnerellamorphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.\n\n \n                  Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, e.g.,\n \n  Trichomonas vaginalis,\n \n  Chlamydia trachomatis,\n \n  N. gonorrhoeae,\n \n  Candida albicans, and\n \n  Herpes simplexvirus should be ruled out.",
    "contraindications": "The recommended dose is one applicator full of metronidazole vaginal gel (approximately 5 grams containing approximately 37.5 mg of metronidazole) intravaginally once or twice a day for 5 days. For once-a-day dosing, metronidazole vaginal gel should be administered at bedtime.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Metronidazole vaginal gel, 0.75% is a clear colorless to yellow gel with no visible grit or particles, supplied in a 70 g aluminum tube with HDPE cap and packaged with 5 vaginal applicators.\n                  The NDC number for the 70 g tube is 71656-067-70.\n                  Store at controlled room temperature 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Protect from freezing.\n                  \n                     Clinical Studies\n                  \n                  In a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of non-pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis who received metronidazole vaginal gel daily for 5 days, the clinical cure rates for evaluable patients determined at 4 weeks after completion of therapy for the QD and BID regimens were 98/185 (53%) and 109/190 (57%), respectively.\n                  Distributed by: \n  \n                     Saptalis Pharmaceuticals, LLC.\n                       Hauppauge, NY 11788 \n  \n                     MADE IN USA\n                       Rev.11/2024-R2",
