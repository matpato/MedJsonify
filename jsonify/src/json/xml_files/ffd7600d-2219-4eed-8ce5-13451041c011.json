    "indications": "50% Dextrose Injection is indicated in the treatment of insulin hypoglycemia (hyperinsulinemia or insulin shock) to restore blood glucose levels.\n                  The solution is also indicated, after dilution, for intravenous infusion as a source of carbohydrate calories in patients whose oral intake is restricted or inadequate to maintain nutritional requirements. Slow infusion of hypertonic solutions is essential to ensure proper utilization of dextrose and avoid production of hyperglycemia.",
    "contraindications": "For peripheral vein administration:\n                     Injection of the solution should be made slowly.\n                  The maximum rate at which dextrose can be infused without producing glycosuria is 0.5 g/kg of body weight/hour. About 95% of the dextrose is retained when infused at a rate of 0.8 g/kg/hr.\n                  In insulin-induced hypoglycemia, intravenous injection of 10 to 25 grams of dextrose (20 to 50 mL of 50% dextrose) is usually adequate. Repeated doses and supportive treatment may be required in severe cases. A specimen for blood glucose determination should be taken before injecting the dextrose. In such emergencies, dextrose should be administered promptly without awaiting pretreatment test results.\n                  \n                     For central venous administration:\n                     For total parenteral nutrition 50% Dextrose Injection, USP is administered by slow intravenous infusion (a) after admixture with amino acid solutions via an indwelling catheter with the tip positioned in a large central vein, preferably the superior vena cava, or (b) after dilution with sterile water for injection. Dosage should be adjusted to meet individual patient requirements.\n                  Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.\n                  The maximum rate of dextrose administration which does not result in glycosuria is the same as cited above.\n                  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See CONTRAINDICATIONS.",

    "adverseReactions": "A concentrated dextrose solution should not be used when intracranial or intraspinal hemorrhage is present, nor in the presence of delirium tremens if the patient is already dehydrated.\n                  Dextrose injection without electrolytes should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because of the possibility that pseudoagglutination of red cells may occur."
