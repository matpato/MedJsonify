    "indications": "Acute Infections Caused by Susceptible Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n                  \n                  Polymyxin B sulfate is a drug of choice in the treatment of infections of the urinary tract, meninges, and bloodstream caused by susceptible strains of Ps. aeruginosa. It may also be used topically and subconjunctivally in the treatment of infections of the eye caused by susceptible strains of Ps. aeruginosa.\n                  \n                  It may be indicated in serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the following organisms, when less potentially toxic drugs are ineffective or contraindicated:\n                  \n                  \n                     H. influenzae, specifically meningeal infections.\n                  \n                  \n                     Escherichia coli, specifically urinary tract infections.\n                  \n                  \n                     Aerobacter aerogenes, specifically bacteremia.\n                  \n                  \n                     Klebsiella pneumoniae, specifically bacteremia.\n                  \n                  NOTE: IN MENINGEAL INFECTIONS, POLYMYXIN B SULFATE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY THE INTRATHECAL ROUTE.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of polymyxin B and other antibacterial drugs, polymyxin B should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
