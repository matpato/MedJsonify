    "indications": "Guanfacine tablets are indicated in the management of hypertension. Guanfacine tablets may be given alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics.",
    "contraindications": "The recommended initial dose of guanfacine tablets when given alone or in combination with another antihypertensive drug is 1 mg daily given at bedtime to minimize somnolence. If after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy 1 mg does not give a satisfactory result, a dose of 2 mg may be given, although most of the effect of guanfacine tablets are seen at 1 mg (see \n       \n \n  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Higher daily doses have been used, but adverse reactions increase significantly with doses above 3 mg/day. \n      \n\n \n                  The frequency of rebound hypertension is low, but it can occur. When rebound occurs, it does so after 2 to 4 days, which is delayed compared with clonidine hydrochloride. This is consistent with the longer half-life of guanfacine. In most cases, after abrupt withdrawal of guanfacine, blood pressure returns to pretreatment levels slowly (within 2 to 4 days) without ill effects.",
