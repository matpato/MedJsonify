    "contraindications": "The optimal daily dose of calcitriol capsules must be carefully determined for each patient. Calcitriol can be administered orally as a capsule (0.25 mcg or 0.50 mcg). Calcitriol therapy should always be started at the lowest possible dose and should not be increased without careful monitoring of serum calcium.\n                  The effectiveness of calcitriol capsule therapy is predicated on the assumption that each patient is receiving an adequate but not excessive daily intake of calcium. Patients are advised to have a dietary intake of calcium at a minimum of 600 mg daily. The U.S. RDA for calcium in adults is 800 mg to 1200 mg. To ensure that each patient receives an adequate daily intake of calcium, the physician should either prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct the patient in proper dietary measures.\n                  Because of improved calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, some patients on calcitriol may be maintained on a lower calcium intake. Patients who tend to develop hypercalcemia may require only low doses of calcium or no supplementation at all.\n                  During the titration period of treatment with calcitriol, serum calcium levels should be checked at least twice weekly. When the optimal dosage of calcitriol has been determined, serum calcium levels should be checked every month (or as given below for individual indications). Samples for serum calcium estimation should be taken without a tourniquet.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Calcitriol capsules are available as follows:\n                  0.25 mcg - opaque, red-brown and yellow-brown, two-tone, oval, soft, gelatin capsules, imprinted “93” and “657”, in bottles of 100 (NDC: 72162-1031-01).\n                  Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Protect from light.\n                  Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP, with a child-resistant closure (as required).\n                  \n                  Repackaged/Relabeled by:\n  \nBryant Ranch Prepack, Inc.\n  \nBurbank, CA 91504",
    "adverseReactions": "Calcitriol capsules should not be given to patients with hypercalcemia or evidence of vitamin D toxicity. Use of calcitriol capsules in patients with known hypersensitivity to calcitriol (or drugs of the same class) or any of the inactive ingredients is contraindicated.",
