Acetazolamide Tablets are also indicated for the prevention or amelioration of symptoms associated with acute mountain sickness in climbers attempting rapid ascent and in those who are very susceptible to acute mountain sickness despite gradual ascent.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Acetazolamide Tablets USP are supplied as follows: \n    125 mg - White, round, scored in half, on one side, \"T52\" engraved on the other side. \n    NDC 55289-720-06 Bottle of 6 \n    NDC 55289-720-12 Bottle of 12",
    "adverseReactions": "Acetazolamide therapy is contraindicated in situations in which sodium and/or potassium blood serum levels are depressed, in cases of marked kidney and liver disease or dysfunction, in suprarenal gland failure, and in hyperchloremic acidosis. It is contraindicated in patients with cirrhosis because of the risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy.\n                  Long-term administration of acetazolamide is contraindicated in patients with chronic non-congestive angle-closure glaucoma since it may permit organic closure of the angle to occur while the worsening glaucoma is masked by lowered intraocular pressure."
