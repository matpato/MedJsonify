    "adverseReactions": "Coadministration of ergotamine with potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin) has been associated with acute ergot toxicity (ergotism) characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities (see \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS: \n   Drug Interactions\n                     ), with some cases resulting in amputation. There have been rare reports of cerebral ischemia in patients on protease inhibitor therapy when ergotamine tartrate and caffeine tablets was coadministered, at least one resulting in death. Because of the increased risk of ergotism and other serious vasospastic adverse events, ergotamine use is contraindicated with these drugs and other potent inhibitors of CYP 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) (see \n  \n                        WARNINGS: \n   CYP 3A4 Inhibitors\n                     ).\n \n                  Ergotamine tartrate and caffeine tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Ergotamine tartrate and caffeine tablets is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this product, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.\n                  Peripheral vascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, impaired hepatic or renal function and sepsis.\n                  Hypersensitivity to any of the components."
