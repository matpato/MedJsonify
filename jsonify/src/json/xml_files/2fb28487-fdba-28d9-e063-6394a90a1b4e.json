    "indications": "Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray is indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura.\n                  Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine.",
    "contraindications": "The solution used in Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray (4 mg/mL) is intended for intranasal use and must not be injected.\n                  \n                  In clinical trials, Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray has been effective for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura. One spray (0.5 mg) of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray should be administered in each nostril. Fifteen minutes later, an additional one spray (0.5 mg) of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray should be administered in each nostril, for a total dosage of four sprays (2 mg) of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray. Studies have shown no additional benefit from acute doses greater than 2 mg for a single migraine administration. The safety of doses greater than 3 mg in a 24-hour period and 4 mg in a 7‑day period has not been established.\n                  Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray, should not be used for chronic daily administration.\n                  Prior to administration, the pump must be primed (i.e., squeeze 4 times) before use (see administration instructions). Once the nasal spray applicator has been prepared, it should be discarded (with any remaining drug in opened vial) after 8 hours.\n                  \n                     \n                        Prior to administration, the pump must be primed (i.e., squeeze 4 times) before use (see administration instructions).\n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     Once the nasal spray applicator has been prepared, it should be discarded (with any remaining drug in opened vial after 8 hours).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray is available (as a clear, colorless to light yellow aqueous solution) in 3.5 mL amber glass vials containing 4 mg of dihydroergotamine mesylate.\n                  Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray is provided as a package of 8 units, administration instruction sheet, and one package insert. Each unit consists of one vial and one sprayer (NDC 68682-357-10).",
    "adverseReactions": "There have been a few reports of serious adverse events associated with the coadministration of dihydroergotamine and potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, such as protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics, resulting in vasospasm that led to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. The use of potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, troleandomycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole) with dihydroergotamine is, therefore contraindicated (\n  \n   see\n                        WARNINGS, CYP 3A4 Inhibitors).\n \n  \n                  \n                  \n                     Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray should not be given to patients with ischemic heart disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or documented silent ischemia) or to patients who have clinical symptoms or findings consistent with coronary artery vasospasm including Prinzmetal’s variant angina (\n  \n   see\n                        WARNINGS).\n \n  \n                  \n                  \n                     Because Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray may increase blood pressure, it should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n                  \n                  \n                     Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray, 5-HT\n  \n   1agonists (e.g., sumatriptan), ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications or methysergide should not be used within 24 hours of each other.\n \n  \n                  \n                  \n                     Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray should not be administered to patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine.\n                  \n                  In addition to those conditions mentioned above, Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray is also contraindicated in patients with known peripheral arterial disease, sepsis, following vascular surgery, and severely impaired hepatic or renal function.\n                  Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients who have previously shown hypersensitivity to ergot alkaloids.\n                  Dihydroergotamine mesylate should not be used with peripheral and central vasoconstrictors because the combination may result in additive or synergistic elevation of blood pressure."
