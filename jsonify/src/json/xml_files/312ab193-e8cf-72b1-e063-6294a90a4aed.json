When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules per day). The maximum daily dosage is 16 mg (eight capsules per day). If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment.\n                    \n                  Elderly\n                  No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in elderly subjects.

No dose adjustment is required for the elderly.\n                  \n                  In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Avoid Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules in elderly patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, Class IA or III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (see \n       \n \n   WARNINGS).\n      \n\n \n                    \n                  Renal Impairment\n                  No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since the metabolites and the unchanged drug are mainly excreted in the feces, no dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see \n       \n \n  PRECAUTIONS).\n      \n\n \n                    \n                  Hepatic Impairment\n                  The pharmacokinetics of loperamide have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.\n                  \n                  \n                      Use Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules with caution in such patients because the systemic exposure may be increased due to reduced metabolism (see \n       \n \n  PRECAUTIONS).",
