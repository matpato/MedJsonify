    "indications": "Sildenafil is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [see Clinical Studies (14)].\n                  Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II–III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%).",
    "contraindications": "1. Tablets and oral suspension: 5 mg or 20 mg three times a day, 4–6 hours apart; see full prescribing information for reconstitution instructions for the Powder for Oral Suspension ( 2.1 , 2.2 )",
    "adverseReactions": "Sildenafil is contraindicated in patients with:\n                  \n                     \n                        •Concomitant use of organic nitrates in any form, either regularly or intermittently, because of the greater risk of hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\n                     \n                        •Concomitant use of riociguat, a guanylate cyclase stimulator. PDE-5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of riociguat.\n                     \n                        •Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or any component of the tablet or oral suspension. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reaction, has been reported in association with the use of sildenafil.",
