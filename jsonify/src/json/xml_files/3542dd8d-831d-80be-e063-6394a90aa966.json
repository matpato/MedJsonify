In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, fluconazole tablets were also effective for the treatment of\n  \n   Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic\n  \n   Candidainfections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.\n \n  \n                     \n                        Cryptococcal meningitis.

Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.",
