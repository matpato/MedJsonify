    "indications": "H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence\n                     \n                      The components in lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or one-year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence (see \n                        CLINICAL STUDIES\n                     and \n                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n                     \n                     ).\n                     \n                      To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

    "adverseReactions": "Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets are contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute interstitial nephritis, and urticaria (see \n                        ADVERSE REACTIONS\n                     ). Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs), including lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, are contraindicated with rilpivirine-containing products (see \n                        CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n                     \n                     , \n                     \n                        Drug Interaction Studies\n                     ).\n                      A history of severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins) is a contraindication.\n                      Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to clarithromycin, erythromycin, or any of the macrolide antibiotics.\n                      Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin is contraindicated with concomitant use of lurasidone due to the risk of an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions [(see \n                        \n                           PRECAUTIONS\n                        \n                     , \n                        \n                           Drug Interactions\n                        \n                     ) (7)].\n                      Clarithromycin should not be given to patients with history of QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes.\n                     \n                      Concomitant administration of clarithromycin, a component of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets, and any of the following drugs is contraindicated: cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine or dihydroergotamine (see \n                        PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions\n                     ). There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when clarithromycin and/or erythromycin are coadministered with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine resulting in cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes) most likely due to inhibition of metabolism of these drugs by erythromycin and clarithromycin. Fatalities have been reported.\n                      Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.\n                      Clarithromycin should not be used concomitantly with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 (lovastatin or simvastatin), due to the increase risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis (see \n                        WARNINGS\n                     )."
