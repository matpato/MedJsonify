In patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides, clonazepam tablets may be useful.\n\n \n                  \n                  Some loss of effect may occur during the course of clonazepam treatment (see \n \n  PRECAUTIONS: \n \n  \n                        Loss of Effect\n                     ).\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                        Panic Disorder:\n                     Clonazepam tablets are indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-V. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks.\n\n \n                  \n                  The efficacy of clonazepam tablets was established in two 6- to 9-week trials in panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see \n \n  \n                        CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:\n                      \n \n  \n                        Clinical Trials\n                     ).\n\n \n                  \n                  Panic disorder (DSM-V) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes.\n                  \n                  The effectiveness of clonazepam tablets in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use clonazepam tablets for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see\n \n  \n                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n                     ).",
    "contraindications": "Clonazepam is available as a tablet. The tablets should be administered with water by swallowing the tablet whole.\n                  \n                  \n                     \n                        Seizure Disorders:\n                     \n                     \n                  \n                  The use of multiple anticonvulsants may result in an increase of CNS depressant adverse effects. This should be considered before adding clonazepam tablets to an existing anticonvulsant regimen.\n                  \n                     \n                        Adults:\n                     The initial dose for adults with seizure disorders should not exceed 1.5 mg/day divided into three doses. Dosage may be increased in increments of 0.5 to 1 mg every 3 days until seizures are adequately controlled or until side effects preclude any further increase. Maintenance dosage must be individualized for each patient depending upon response. Maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg.\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                        Pediatric Patients:\n                     Clonazepam tablets are administered orally. In order to minimize drowsiness, the initial dose for infants and children (up to 10 years of age or 30 kg of body weight) should be between 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg/day but not to exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day given in two or three divided doses. Dosage should be increased by no more than 0.25 to 0.5 mg every third day until a daily maintenance dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg of body weight has been reached, unless seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increase. Whenever possible, the daily dose should be divided into three equal doses. If doses are not equally divided, the largest dose should be given before retiring.\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                        Geriatric Patients:\n                     There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam tablets in seizure disorder patients 65 years of age and older. In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam tablets and observed closely (see \n \n  PRECAUTIONS: \n \n  Geriatric Use).\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                        Panic Disorder:\n                     \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                        Adults:\n                     The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg twice daily. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of 1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0.25 mg twice daily every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable.\n\n \n                  \n                  Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg twice daily every 3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn.\n                  \n                  There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the physician who elects to use clonazepam tablets for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.\n                  \n                     \n                        Pediatric Patients:\n                     There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam tablets in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age.\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                        Geriatric Patients:\n                     There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam tablets in panic disorder patients 65 years of age and older.

If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see \n \n  WARNINGS: \n \n  Dependence and Withdrawal Reactionsand \n \n  DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: \n \n  Dependence).",
