    "indications": "Timolol Maleate Sterile Ophthalmic Gel Forming Solution is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.",
    "contraindications": "Patients should be instructed to invert the closed container and shake once before each use. It is not necessary to shake the container more than once. Other topically applied ophthalmic medications should be administered at least 10 minutes before Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Gel Forming Solution [see\n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS,\n  \n   Information for Patients\n                     and accompanying\n \n  \n                        INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE\n                     ].\n\n \n                  Timolol Maleate Sterile Ophthalmic Gel Forming Solution is available in concentrations of 0.25% and 0.5%. The dose is one drop of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Gel Forming Solution (either 0.25% or 0.5%) in the affected eye(s) once a day.\n                  Because in some patients the pressure-lowering response to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Gel Forming Solution may require a few weeks to stabilize, evaluation should include a determination of intraocular pressure after approximately 4 weeks of treatment with Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Gel Forming Solution.\n                  Dosages higher than one drop of 0.5% Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Gel Forming Solution once a day have not been studied. If the patient’s intraocular pressure is still not at a satisfactory level on this regimen, concomitant therapy can be considered. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended [see\n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS,\n  \n   Drug Interactions,\n  \n   Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents\n                     ].\n\n \n                  When patients have been switched from therapy with Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution administered twice daily to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Gel Forming Solution administered once daily, the ocular hypotensive effect has remained consistent.",
