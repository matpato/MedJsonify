    "contraindications": "Inspect visually before use. Appearance should be uniformly white and cloudy. Do not use it if it looks clear or if it contains solid particles ( 2.1 ). Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 must be resuspended immediately before use. Resuspension is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature ( 2.1 ). Inject Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 subcutaneously in the abdominal region, buttocks, thigh, or upper arm (2.1). Administer the dose within 15 minutes before meal initiation. For patients with type 2 diabetes, the dose may also be given after meal initiation ( 2.1 ). Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis (2.1) . Do not administer intravenously or use in insulin infusion pumps ( 2.1 ). Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is typically dosed twice-daily (with each dose intended to cover 2 meals or a meal and a snack) (2.2) . Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, glycemic control goal ( 2.2 ). Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (i.e., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness ( 2.2 ). When switching from another insulin to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, a different dosage of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 may be needed ( 2.2 ).",
