In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen\n \n  [see\n  \n   Warnings and Precautions (\n  \n   5.2,\n  \n   5.14)]\n \n  .\n\n \n                  Use estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.",
