    "contraindications": "Store cisatracurium besylate injection with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product (2.1) • Administer intravenously only by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians familiar with drug’s actions and possible complications ( 2.1 ) • Use only if personnel and facilities for resuscitation and life support, and a cisatracurium besylate antagonist are immediately available ( 2.1 ) • Use a peripheral nerve stimulator to determine adequacy of blockade (e.g., need for additional doses), minimize risk of overdosage or underdosage, assess extent of recovery from blockade, potentially limit exposure to toxic metabolites through dose titration, and facilitate more rapid reversal of cisatracurium besylate-induced paralysis ( 2.1 ) • See the Full Prescribing Information for: o Dosage and administration instructions in adults, pediatric patients, geriatric patients, patients with neuromuscular disease, burns, end- stage renal disease, and patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with induced hypothermia ( 2.2 , 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 ) o Continuous infusion rates ( 2.6 ) o Preparation instructions ( 2.7 ) o Drug compatibility ( 2.8 )",
