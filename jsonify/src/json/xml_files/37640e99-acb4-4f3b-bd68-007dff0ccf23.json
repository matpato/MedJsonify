Electrocardiograms (ECGs) prior to dosing and at end of observation period required. ( 2.4 ) o Monitor until resolution if heart rate < 45 beats per minute (bpm) in adults, < 55 bpm in patients aged 12 years and above, or < 60 bpm in pediatric patients aged 10 to below 12 years, atrioventricular (AV) block, or if lowest postdose heart rate is at the end of the observation period. ( 2.4 ) o Monitor symptomatic bradycardia with ECG until resolved. Continue overnight if intervention is required; repeat first-dose monitoring for second dose. ( 2.4 ) o Observe patients overnight if at higher risk of symptomatic bradycardia, heart block, prolonged QTc interval, or if taking drugs with known risk of torsades de pointes. ( 2.4 , 7.1 )",
