    "indications": "Vancomycin hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the treatment of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea.

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
