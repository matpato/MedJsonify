    "indications": "To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy.\n                  \n                     \n                        Urinary Tract Infections\n                     \n                  \n                  For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the following organisms: \n \n  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilisand\n \n  Proteus vulgaris.
