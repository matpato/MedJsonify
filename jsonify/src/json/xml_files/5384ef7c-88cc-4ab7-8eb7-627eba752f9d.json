    "indications": "Treprostinil injection is a prostacyclin mimetic indicated for: • Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; WHO Group 1) to diminish symptoms associated with exercise. Studies establishing effectiveness included patients with NYHA Functional Class II-IV symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (58%), PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts (23%), or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (19%). (1.1) • Patients who require transition from epoprostenol, to reduce the rate of clinical deterioration. The risks and benefits of each drug should be carefully considered prior to transition. (1.2)",
    "contraindications": "PAH WHO Group 1 in patients with NYHA Class II-IV symptoms: • Initial dose for patients new to prostacyclin infusion therapy: 1.25 ng/kg/min; increase based on clinical response (increments of 1.25 ng/kg/min per week for the first 4 weeks of treatment, later 2.5 ng/kg/min per week). Avoid abrupt cessation. (2.2, 2.4) • Mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency: Decrease initial dose to 0.625 ng/kg/min. Severe hepatic insufficiency: No studies performed. (2.5) Transition from Epoprostenol: • Increase the Treprostinil injection dose gradually as the epoprostenol dose is decreased, based on constant observation of response. (2.7) Administration: Continuous subcutaneous infusion is the preferred mode. Use intravenous (IV) infusion if subcutaneous infusion is not tolerated. (2.1, 2.6)",
