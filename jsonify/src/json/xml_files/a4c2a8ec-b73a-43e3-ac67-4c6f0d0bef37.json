    "indications": "Ampicillin for Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions:\n                  \n                     Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae, and Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococci.\n                  \n                     Bacterial Meningitis caused by E. coli, Group B Streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria.\n                  \n                     Septicemia and Endocarditis caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including Streptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci, and enterococci. Gram-negative sepsis caused by E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella spp. responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy. The addition of an aminoglycoside may enhance the effectiveness of ampicillin when treating streptococcal endocarditis.\n                  \n                     Urinary Tract Infections caused by sensitive strains of E. coli and Proteus mirabilis.\n                  \n                  \n                     Gastrointestinal Infections caused by Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever), other Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. (dysentery) usually respond to oral or intravenous therapy.\n                  Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.\n                  It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ampicillin for Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Ampicillin for Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n                  Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.",
    "contraindications": "The Single Use ADD-Vantage® vials are for intravenous use only. Infections of the respiratory tract and soft tissues.\n                  Patients weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or more: 250 mg to 500 mg every 6 hours.\n                  Patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lbs): 25 to 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses at 6- to 8- hour intervals.\n                  Infections of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts (including those caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae in females).\n                  Patients weighing 40 kg (88 lbs) or more: 500 mg every 6 hours.\n                  Patients weighing less than 40 kg (88 lbs): 50 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses at 6- to 8- hour intervals.\n                  In the treatment of chronic urinary tract and intestinal infections, frequent bacteriological and clinical appraisal is necessary. Smaller doses than those recommended above should not be used. Higher doses should be used for stubborn or severe infections. In stubborn infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy.\n                  Urethritis in males due to N. gonorrhoeae.\n                  \n                  \n                     Adults – Two doses of 500 mg each at an interval of 8 to 12 hours. Treatment may be repeated if necessary or extended if required.\n                  In the treatment of complications of gonorrheal urethritis, such as prostatitis and epididymitis, prolonged and intensive therapy is recommended. Cases of gonorrhea with a suspected primary lesion of syphilis should have darkfield examinations before receiving treatment. In all other cases where concomitant syphilis is suspected, monthly serological tests should be made for a minimum of four months. \n                  The doses for the preceding infections may be given by either the intramuscular or intravenous route. A change to oral ampicillin may be made when appropriate.",
