    "contraindications": "(SEE BELOW)\n  \n   TABLE\n                     \n                  \n                  Carbamazepine suspension in combination with liquid chlorpromazine or thioridazine results in precipitate formation, and, in the case of chlorpromazine, there has been a report of a patient passing an orange rubbery precipitate in the stool following coadministration of the two drugs (see ). Because the extent to which this occurs with other liquid medications is not known, carbamazepine suspension should not be administered simultaneously with other liquid medications or diluents.\n \n  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions\n                  \n                  Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see ). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.\n \n  PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests\n                  \n                  Since a given dose of carbamazepine suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended to start with low doses (children 6 to 12 years: Â½ teaspoon q.i.d.) and to increase slowly to avoid unwanted side effects.\n                  Conversion of patients from oral carbamazepine tablets to carbamazepine suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., b.i.d. tablets to t.i.d. suspension).\n                  Carbamazepine extended-release tablets is an extended-release formulation for twice-a-day administration. When converting patients from carbamazepine conventional tablets to carbamazepine extended-release tablets, the same total daily mg dose of carbamazepine extended-release tablets should be administered. Carbamazepine extended-release tablets should be inspected for chips or cracks. Damaged tablets should not be consumed.\n \n  Carbamazepine extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "NDC:17856-4047-1 in a CUP of 10 SUSPENSIONS",
    "adverseReactions": "Carbamazepine should not be used in patients with a history of previous bone marrow depression, hypersensitivity to the drug, or known sensitivity to any of the tricyclic compounds, such as amitriptyline, desipramine, imipramine, protriptyline, nortriptyline, etc. Likewise, on theoretical grounds its use with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors is not recommended. Before administration of carbamazepine, MAO inhibitors should be discontinued for a minimum of 14 days, or longer if the clinical situation permits.\n                  Coadministration of carbamazepine and nefazodone may result in insufficient plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite to achieve a therapeutic effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated."
