    "indications": "ALVAIZ is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated: for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult and pediatric patients 6 years and older with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. ALVAIZ should be used only in patients with ITP whose degree of thrombocytopenia and clinical condition increase the risk for bleeding. ( 1.1 ) for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation and maintenance of interferon-based therapy. ALVAIZ should be used only in patients with chronic hepatitis C whose degree of thrombocytopenia prevents the initiation of interferon-based therapy or limits the ability to maintain interferon-based therapy. ( 1.2 ) for the treatment of adult patients with severe aplastic anemia who have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy. ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use: ALVAIZ is not indicated for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). ( 1.4 ) Safety and efficacy have not been established in combination with direct-acting antiviral agents used without interferon for treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. ( 1.4 )",
