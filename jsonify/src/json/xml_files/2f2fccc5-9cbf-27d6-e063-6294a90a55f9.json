( 2.2 , 2.4 ) See full prescribing information for instructions on preparation and administration. ( 2.1 , 2.3 ) Recommended Dosage for Correction of Hypophosphatemia in Intravenous Fluids Potassium phosphates injection is only for administration to a patient with a serum potassium concentration less than 4 mEq/dL; otherwise, use an alternative source of phosphorus. ( 2.1 ) The dosage is dependent upon the individual needs of the patient, and the contribution of phosphorus and potassium from other sources. ( 2.2 ) See full prescribing information for recommendations on initial or single dosing, repeated dosing, concentration and infusion rate. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Recommended Dosage for Administration in Parenteral Nutrition Individualize the dosage based upon the patient’s clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral phosphorus and potassium intake.
