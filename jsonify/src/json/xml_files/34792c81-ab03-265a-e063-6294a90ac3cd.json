    "indications": "Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) is indicated only for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of\n \n  Escherichia colior\n \n  Staphylococcus saprophyticus.\n                  \n                  Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) and other antibacterial drugs, nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n                  Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria (see\n \n  \n                        CLINICAL STUDIES\n                     ). Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals), other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals), lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.",

    "adverseReactions": "Anuria, oliguria, or significant impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance under 60 mL per minute or clinically significant elevated serum creatinine) are contraindications. Treatment of this type of patient carries an increased risk of toxicity because of impaired excretion of the drug.\n                  Because of the possibility of hemolytic anemia due to immature erythrocyte enzyme systems (glutathione instability), the drug is contraindicated in pregnant patients at term (38 to 42 weeks gestation), during labor and delivery, or when the onset of labor is imminent. For the same reason, the drug is contraindicated in neonates under one month of age.\n                  Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with nitrofurantoin.\n                  Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) is also contraindicated in those patients with known hypersensitivity to nitrofurantoin."
