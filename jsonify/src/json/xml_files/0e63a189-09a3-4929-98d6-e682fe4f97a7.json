    "indications": "Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection is a combination of sulfamethoxazole, a sulfonamide antimicrobial, and trimethoprim, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor antibacterial, indicated in adults and pediatric patients two months of age and older for treatment of infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria. Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia ( 1.1 ) Shigellosis ( 1.2 ) Urinary Tract Infections ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

    "contraindications": "Dosage Guidelines For Adults and Pediatric Patients (Two Months of Age and Older) Infection Total Daily Dose (based on trimethoprim content) Frequency Duration Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia 15 to 20 mg/kg (in 3 or 4 equally divided doses) Every 6 to 8 hours 14 days Severe Urinary Tract Infections 8 to 10 mg/kg (in 2 to 4 equally divided doses) Every 6, 8 or 12 hours 14 days Shigellosis 8 to 10 mg/kg (in 2 to 4 equally divided doses) Every 6, 8 or 12 hours 5 days For patients with impaired renal function, a reduced dosage should be employed. ( 2.2 ) Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection must be given by intravenous infusion over a period of 60 to 90 minutes. Rapid infusion or bolus injection must be avoided. ( 2.3 ) Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Injection must be diluted in 5% dextrose in water solution prior to administration.
