    "indications": "1.1 Trichomoniasis\n                  \n                  Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by \n  Trichomonas vaginalis. The organism should be identified by appropriate diagnostic procedures. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, partners of infected patients should be treated simultaneously in order to prevent re-infection \n  [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     1.2 Giardiasis\n                  \n                  Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of giardiasis caused by \n  Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia) in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age \n  [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     1.3 Amebiasis\n                  \n                  Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by \n  Entamoeba histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age. It is not indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage \n  [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)].\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     1.4 Bacterial Vaginosis\n                  \n                  Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as \n  Haemophilus vaginitis, \n  Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis) in adult women \n  [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].\n                  \n                  Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis such as \n  Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans and \n  Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out.\n \n                  \n                  \n                     1.5 Usage\n                  \n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tinidazole and other antibacterial drugs, tinidazole should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

Reported reactions have ranged in severity from urticaria to Stevens-Johnson syndrome\n    [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].\n                     \n                     In patients with Cockayne syndrome.
