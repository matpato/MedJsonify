    "indications": "Clindamycin Phosphate in Sodium Chloride Injection contains clindamycin, a lincosamide antibacterial indicated for the treatment of the following in adult and pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved: • Serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria  ( 1.1 ) • Infections Due to Susceptible Isolates of Streptococci, Pneumococci and Staphylococci.  ( 1.2 ) • Lower Respiratory Tract Infections.  ( 1.3 ) • Skin and Skin Structure Infections.  ( 1.4 ) • Gynecological Infections.  ( 1.5 ) • Intra-abdominal Infections.  ( 1.6 ) • Septicemia.  ( 1.7 ) • Bone and Joint Infections.  ( 1.8 ) Limitation of use Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, Clindamycin Phosphate in Sodium Chloride Injection should not be used in the treatment of meningitis ( 1.9 ) Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Clindamycin Phosphate in Sodium Chloride Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Clindamycin Phosphate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.  ( 1.10 )",
    "contraindications": "• If a dose of Clindamycin Phosphate in Sodium Chloride Injection is required that does not equal 300 mg 600 mg or 900 mg, this product is not recommended for use and an alternative formulation of clindamycin should be considered.  ( 2.1 ) • Recommended Adult Dosage:  Serious infections due to aerobic gram-positive cocci and the more susceptible anaerobes (NOT generally including Bacteroides fragilis , Peptococcus species and Clostridioides species other than Clostridium perfringens ):  600–1200 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses by intravenous infusion.  ( 2.2 ) • More severe infections, particularly those due to proven or suspected Bacteroides fragilis , Peptococcus species, or Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens :  1200–2700 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses by intravenous infusion.  ( 2.2 ) • Dosage in Pediatric Patients (1 Month of Age to 16 Years):  20 to 40 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equal doses by intravenous infusion.  ( 2.3 ) • Alternative Pediatric Patients Dosing:  350 mg/m 2 /day for serious infections and 450 mg/m2/day for more severe infections.  ( 2.3 ) • Dosage in Neonates (Less than 1 Month of Age):  15 to 20 mg/kg/day in 3 to 4 equal doses by intravenous infusion.  ( 2.3 )",
