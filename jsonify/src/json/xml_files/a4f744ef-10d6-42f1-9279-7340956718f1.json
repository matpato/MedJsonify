    "indications": "Lamotrigine extended-release tablets are indicated for: Adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTC) and partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients aged 13 years and older. (1.1) Conversion to monotherapy in patients aged 13 years and older with partial-onset seizures who are receiving treatment with a single antiepileptic drug. (1.2) Limitation of use: Safety and effectiveness in patients younger than 13 years have not been established. (1.3)",
    "contraindications": "Do not exceed      the recommended initial dosage and subsequent dose escalation. ( 2.1 ) Initiation of      adjunctive therapy and conversion to monotherapy requires slow titration      dependent on concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); the prescriber must refer      to the appropriate algorithm in Dosage and Administration. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Adjunctive      therapy: Target therapeutic dosage range is 200 to 600 mg daily and is      dependent on concomitant AEDs. ( 2.2 ) Conversion to      monotherapy: Target therapeutic dosage range is 250 to 300 mg daily. ( 2.3 ) Conversion      from immediate-release lamotrigine to lamotrigine extended-release: The      initial dose of lamotrigine extended-release should match the total daily      dose of the immediate-release lamotrigine. Patients should be closely      monitored for seizure control after conversion. ( 2.4 ) Do not restart      lamotrigine extended-release in patients who discontinued due to rash      unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Adjustments to      maintenance doses will be necessary in most patients starting or stopping      estrogen-containing products, including oral contraceptives.      ( 2.1 , 5.9 ) Discontinuation:      Taper over a period of at least 2 weeks (approximately 50% dose reduction      per week). ( 2.1 , 5.10 )",
