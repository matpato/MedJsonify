    "indications": "Technetium Tc 99m Pyrophosphate Injection is a skeletal imaging agent used to demonstrate areas of altered osteogenesis, and a cardiac imaging agent used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.\n                  As an adjunct in the diagnosis of confirmed myocardial infarction (ECG and serum enzymes positive), the incidence of false negative images has been found to be 6%. False negative images can also occur if made too early in the evolutionary phase of the infarct or too late in the resolution phase. In a limited study involving 22 patients in whom the ECG was positive and serum enzymes questionable or negative, but in whom the final diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was made, the incidence of false negative images was 23%. The incidence of false positive images has been found to be 7 to 9%. False positive images have been reported following coronary by-pass graft surgery, in unstable angina pectoris, old myocardial infarcts and in cardiac contusions.\n                  Technescan PYP is a blood pool imaging agent which may be used for gated blood pool imaging and for the detection of sites of gastrointestinal bleeding. When administered intravenously 15 to 30 minutes prior to intravenous administration of sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m for in vivo red blood cell labeling, approximately 75% of the injected activity remains in the blood pool. The modified in vivo/in vitro red blood cell labeling method may also be used for blood pool imaging.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "Catalog Number 094.\n                  Technescan PYP is supplied as a lyophilized powder packaged in vials. Each vial contains 11.9 mg sodium pyrophosphate, 3.2 mg (minimum) stannous chloride (SnCl\n \n  2•2H\n \n  2O) and 4.4 milligrams (maximum) total tin expressed as stannous chloride (SnCl\n \n  2•2H\n \n  2O), sealed under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Prior to lyophilization the pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid. The pH of the reconstituted drug is between 4.5 and 7.5.\n\n \n                  Kit containing 5 vials is available.",
