    "indications": "Eplerenone is an aldosterone antagonist indicated for: • Improving survival of stable patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) after an acute myocardial infarction. ( 1.1 ) • The treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.2 )",
    "contraindications": "HFrEF Post-MI : Initiate treatment with 25 mg once daily. Titrate to maximum of 50 mg once daily within 4 weeks, as tolerated. Dose adjustments may be required based on potassium levels. ( 2.1 ) Hypertension : 50 mg once daily, alone or combined with other antihypertensive agents. For inadequate response, increase to 50 mg twice daily. Higher dosages are not recommended. ( 2.2 ) For all patients: Measure serum potassium before starting eplerenone and periodically thereafter.
