    "indications": "Zafirlukast is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children 5 years of age and older.",
    "contraindications": "Because food can reduce the bioavailability of zafirlukast, zafirlukast should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.\n                  \n                     Adults and Children 12 years of age and older\n                  \n                  The recommended dose of zafirlukast in adults and children 12 years and older is 20 mg twice daily.\n                  \n                     Pediatric Patients 5 through 11 years of age \n                  \n                  The recommended dose of zafirlukast in children 5 through 11 years of age is 10 mg twice daily.\n                  \n                     Elderly Patients\n                  \n                  Based on cross-study comparisons, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in elderly patients (65 years of age and older), such that Cmax and AUC are approximately twice those of younger adults.  In clinical trials, a dose of 20 mg twice daily was not associated with an increase in the overall incidence of adverse events or withdrawals because of adverse events in elderly patients.\n                  \n                     Patients with Hepatic Impairment\n                  \n                  Zafirlukast is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment including hepatic cirrhosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). The clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients with stable alcoholic cirrhosis such that the Cmax and AUC are approximately 50 to  60% greater than those of normal adults.  Zafirlukast has not been evaluated in patients with hepatitis or in long-term studies of patients with cirrhosis.\n                  \n                     Patients with Renal Impairment\n                  \n                  Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment.",
