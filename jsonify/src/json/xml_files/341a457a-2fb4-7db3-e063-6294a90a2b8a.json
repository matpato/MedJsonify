    "indications": "Retin-A Micro\n \n  Â®is a retinoid indicated for topical application in the treatment of acne vulgaris.",
    "contraindications": "For topical use only. Not for ophthalmic, oral, or intravaginal use.\n                  Retin-A Micro should be applied once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area in a thin layer. Areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied. If medication is applied excessively, no more rapid or better results will be obtained and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur. A transitory feeling of warmth or slight stinging may be noted on application. In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or to reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or the frequency of application increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate the treatment. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Efficacy has not been established for less than once daily dosing frequencies.\n                  During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent exacerbation of inflammatory lesions may occur. If tolerated, this should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy\n \n  [see\n  \n   Adverse Reactions (6.1)]\n \n  .\n\n \n                  Therapeutic results may be noticed after two weeks, but more than seven weeks of therapy are required before consistent beneficial effects are observed.\n                  Retin-A Micro should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, paranasal creases of the nose, and mucous membranes.\n                  Patients treated with Retin-A Micro may use cosmetics.\n                  Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, products that have a strong drying effect, products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, or spices should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Avoid contact with the peel of limes. Particular caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of topical over-the-counter acne preparations containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with Retin-A Micro. It also is advisable to allow the effects of such preparations to subside before use of Retin-A Micro is begun.",
