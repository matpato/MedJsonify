    "contraindications": "• The recommended starting dose for patients new to or converting from another formulation of methylphenidate is 10 mg. ( 2.2 ) • Methylphenidate transdermal system should be applied to the hip area (using alternating sites) 2 hours before an effect is needed and should be removed 9 hours after application. Methylphenidate transdermal system may be removed earlier than 9 hours if a shorter duration of effect is desired or late day side effects appear. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) • Dosage should be titrated to effect. Dose titration, final dosage, and wear time should be individualized according to the needs and response of the patient. ( 2.2 )",
