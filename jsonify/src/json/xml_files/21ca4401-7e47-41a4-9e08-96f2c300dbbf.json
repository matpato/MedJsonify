    "contraindications": "Dilute prior to administration. (2.1 , 5.1) Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosage accordingly. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) If serum potassium concentration is <2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation. ( 2.1 ) Treatment of hypokalemia: Adults: Initial doses range from 40 to 100 mEq/day in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. Total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; not to exceed 1 mEq/kg as a single-dose or 40 mEq whichever is lower; if deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy. Total daily dose should not exceed 100 mEq. ( 2.3 ) Maintenance or Prophylaxis of hypokalemia: Adults: Typical dose is 20 mEq per day.
