    "contraindications": "Contains 20 mg of calcium gluconate per mL which contains 1.86 mg (0.093 mEq) of elemental calcium. ( 2.1 ) Administer intravenously (bolus or continuous infusion) via a secure intravenous line. ( 2.1 ) See Full Prescribing Information (FPI) for administration rates and appropriate monitoring. ( 2.1 ) Do not dilute calcium gluconate in sodium chloride injection prior to use. Any unused portion should be discarded. ( 2.1 ) Individualize the dose within the recommended range in adults and pediatric patients depending on the severity of symptoms of hypocalcemia, the serum calcium level and the acuity of onset of hypocalcemia. See Table 2 in the FPI for dosing recommendations in mg of calcium gluconate for neonates, pediatric and adult patients. ( 2.2 ) Measure serum calcium during intermittent infusions every 4 hours to 6 hours and during continuous infusion every 1 hour to 4 hours. ( 2.3 ) Calcium gluconate injection is not physically compatible with fluids containing phosphate or bicarbonate. Precipitation may result if mixed. See FPI for all drug incompatibilities. ( 2.5 )",
