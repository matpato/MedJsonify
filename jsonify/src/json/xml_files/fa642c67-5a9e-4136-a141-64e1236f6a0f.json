    "indications": "EVOTAZ is a two-drug combination of atazanavir, a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protease inhibitor, and cobicistat, a CYP3A inhibitor indicated for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV‑1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg. (1) Limitations of Use Use of EVOTAZ in treatment-experienced patients should be guided by the number of baseline primary protease inhibitor resistance substitutions. (1)",
    "contraindications": "• Pretreatment testing: Renal laboratory testing should be performed in all patients prior to initiation of EVOTAZ and continued during treatment with EVOTAZ. Hepatic testing should be performed in patients with underlying liver disease prior to initiation of EVOTAZ and continued during treatment with EVOTAZ. (2.1) • Recommended dosage: One tablet once daily, taken orally with food in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg. (2.2) • Renal impairment: EVOTAZ is not recommended for use in treatment-experienced patients with end-stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis. (2.3 , 8.6) • Hepatic impairment: EVOTAZ is not recommended in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment. (2.4 , 8.7)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions": "EVOTAZ® tablets, 300 mg atazanavir and 150 mg cobicistat, are oval, biconvex, pink, film-coated, debossed with “3641” on one side and plain on the other side. Each bottle contains 30 tablets (NDC-0003-3641-11), a silica gel desiccant and is closed with a child-resistant closure.\n                  Store EVOTAZ tablets at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Keep container tightly closed.",
