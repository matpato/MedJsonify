    "contraindications": "Table 1 (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Xylocaine Injection for various types of anesthetic procedures.  The dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults and refer to the use of epinephrine-free solutions.  When larger volumes are required, only solutions containing epinephrine should be used except in those cases where vasopressor drugs may be contraindicated.\n                  There have been adverse event reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures.  Xylocaine is not approved for this use (see \n       \n \n  \n       \n \n  \n                        WARNINGS\n                      and \n       \n \n  \n       \n \n  \n                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n                     ).\n      \n\n \n      \n\n \n                  These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures.  The actual volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration of anesthesia required, and the physical condition of the patient.  In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will produce the desired result should be given.  Dosages should be reduced for children and for the elderly and debilitated patients and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease.\n                  The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume and concentration (i.e., total dose) of local anesthetic used.  Thus, an increase in volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection will decrease the onset of anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the segmental spread of anesthesia.  However, increasing the volume and concentration of Xylocaine Injection may result in a more profound fall in blood pressure when used in epidural anesthesia.  Although the incidence of side effects with lidocaine HCl is quite low, caution should be exercised when employing large volumes and concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected.\n                  For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50 mL single dose vial containing Xylocaine (lidocaine HCl) 0.5% Injection should be used.",
