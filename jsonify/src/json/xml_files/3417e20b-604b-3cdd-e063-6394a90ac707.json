    "indications": "Cefaclor is indicated in the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms:\n                  \n                     Otitis media caused by \n  Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,staphylococci, and \n  Streptococcus pyogenes\n                  \n                  \n                     Note: β-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains of \n  Haemophilus influenzae should be considered resistant to cefaclor despite apparent \n  in vitro susceptibility of some BLNAR strains.\n \n                  \n                     Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, caused by \n  Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,and \n  Streptococcus pyogenes\n                  \n                  \n                     Note: β-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains of \n  Haemophilus influenzae should be considered resistant to cefaclor despite apparent \n  in vitro susceptibility of some BLNAR strains.\n \n                  \n                     Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis, caused by \n  Streptococcus pyogenes\n                  \n                  \n                     Note:Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment and prevention of streptococcal infections, including the prophylaxis of rheumatic fever. Cefaclor is generally effective in the eradication of streptococci from the nasopharynx; however, substantial data establishing the efficacy of cefaclor in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present.\n \n                  \n                     Urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis and cystitis, caused by \n  Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp \n  .,and coagulase-negative staphylococci\n \n                  \n                     Skin and skin structure infections caused by \n  Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes\n                  \n                  Appropriate culture and susceptibility studies should be performed to determine susceptibility of the causative organism to cefaclor.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefaclor Capsule and other antibacterial drugs, Cefaclor Capsule should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications": "Cefaclor is administered orally.\n                  \n                     Adults ─ The usual adult dosage is 250 mg every 8 hours. For more severe infections (such as pneumonia) or those caused by less susceptible organisms, doses may be doubled.\n \n                  \n                     Pediatric Patients ─ The usual recommended daily dosage for pediatric patients is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours. In more serious infections, otitis media, and infections caused by less susceptible organisms, 40 mg/kg/day are recommended, with a maximum dosage of 1 g/day.\n \n                  Cefaclor may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Under such a condition, the dosage usually is unchanged (see \n  PRECAUTIONS).\n \n                  In the treatment of β-hemolytic streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of cefaclor should be administered for at least 10 days.",
