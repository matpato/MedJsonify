                  <paragraph>Metformin hydrochloride, USP is a white or almost white, crystalline powder with a
  <br/>
molecular formula of C4H11N5•HCl and a molecular weight of 165.62. Metformin
  <br/>
hydrochloride is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol, practically insoluble in
  <br/>
acetone and in Methylene chloride. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1%
  <br/>
aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.35.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP contain 500 mg or 750 mg of
  <br/>
metformin hydrochloride as the active ingredient.

                  <paragraph>System Components and Performance - Metformin hydrochloride extended-release</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>tablets, USP comprises a dual hydrophilic polymer matrix system. Metformin
  <br/>
hydrochloride, USP is combined with a drug release controlling polymer to form an
  <br/>
"inner" phase, which is then incorporated as discrete particles into an "external" phase of
  <br/>
a second polymer. After administration, fluid from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract enters
  <br/>
the tablet, causing the polymers to hydrate and swell. Drug is released slowly from the
  <br/>
dosage form by a process of diffusion through the gel matrix that is essentially
  <br/>
independent of pH. The hydrated polymer system is not rigid and is expected to be
  <br/>
broken up by normal peristalsis in the GI tract. The biologically inert components of the
  <br/>
tablet may occasionally remain intact during GI transit and will be eliminated in the feces
  <br/>
as a soft, hydrated mass.

                        <paragraph>Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see PRECAUTIONS) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Following a single oral dose of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, C 
  <sub>max</sub> is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4  to 8 hours.Peak plasma levels are approximately 20% lower compared to the same dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets, however, the extent of absorption (as measured by AUC) is similar to metformin hydrochloride tablets.
  <br/>
                                 <br/>
At steady state, the AUC and C 
  <sub>max</sub> are less than dose proportional for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets within the range of 500  to 2000 mg administered once daily. Peak plasma levels are approximately 0.6, 1.1, 1.4, and 1.8 mcg/mL for 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg once-daily doses, respectively. The extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at a 2000 mg once-daily dose is similar to the same total daily dose administered as metformin hydrochloride tablets 1000 mg twice daily. After repeated administration of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, metformin did not accumulate in plasma.
  <br/>
                                 <br/>
Within-subject variability in C 
  <sub>max</sub> and AUC of metformin from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is comparable to that with metformin hydrochloride tablets.
  <br/>
                                 <br/>
Although the extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from the metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets increased by approximately 50% when given with food, there was no effect of food on C 
  <sub>max</sub> and T 
  <sub>max</sub> of metformin. Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

                              <paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride tablets, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &lt;1 mcg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of metformin hydrochloride tablets, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at maximum doses.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance (see 
  <content styleCode="bold">Table 1</content>) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.

From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see Table 1; also see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced (see

Patients entering the study had a mean baseline HbA1c of 8% and a mean baseline FPG of 176 mg/dL. After 12 weeks treatment, mean HbA 1c had increased from baseline by 0.1% and mean FPG decreased from baseline by 2 mg/dL in the placebo group, compared with a decrease in mean HbA 1c of 0.6% and a decrease in mean FPG of 23 mg/dL in patients treated with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1000 mg once daily. Subsequently, the treatment dose was increased to 1500 mg once daily if HbA 1c was ≥7% but &lt;8% (patients with HbA 1c ≥8% were discontinued from the study).

The onset of metformin associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels(&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidenceof ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL (see PRECAUTIONS).</content>

  <content styleCode="italics">Lactic acidosis</content> –There have been post marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by
  <br/>
    nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have
  <br/>
    occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence

    of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing
  <br/>
    lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>    If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of or 
  <br/>
    metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt
  <br/>
    hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good
  <br/>
    hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.
  <br/>
                           <br/>
    Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extend release
  <br/>
    tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.

  <content styleCode="italics">Renal impairment</content>—The post marketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.
  <br/>
                           <br/>
    The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the
  <br/>
    kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY):
 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>  o Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets, obtain an estimated  glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
  <br/>
                           <br/>
    o Metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).
  <br/>
                           <br/>
    o Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
  <br/>
                           <br/>
    o Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the  
  <br/>
       elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>    o In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>•  
  <content styleCode="italics">Drug Interactions</content> – The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extend release tablets with   specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis:
  <br/>
    those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent
  <br/>
    monitoring of patients.
  <br/>
                           <br/>
• 
  <content styleCode="italics"> Age 65 or greater</content>—The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the   patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal,
  <br/>
    or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.
 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>

  <content styleCode="italics">Radiologic studies with contrast</content>—Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the
  <br/>
    occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR
  <br/>
    between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated
  <br/>
    contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets if renal function is stable.

  <content styleCode="italics">Hypoxic states</content>— several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when  accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets.

Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Measurement of hematologic parameters on an annual basis is advised in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and any apparent abnormalities should be appropriately investigated and managed (see

Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of metformin therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be counselled against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.

                           <br/>
Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets alone does not usually cause hypoglycemia, although it may occur when metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is used in conjunction with oral sulfonylureas and insulin. When initiating combination therapy, the risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members. (See PATIENT INFORMATION

  <br/>
                           <br/>
Patients should be informed that metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and not crushed or chewed, and that the inactive ingredients may occasionally be eliminated in the feces as a soft mass that may resemble the original tablet.

                        <paragraph>Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. During initial dose titration, fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response. Thereafter, both glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin should be monitored. Measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin may be especially useful for evaluating long-term control (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit and red blood cell indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis.While megaloblastic anemia has rarely been seen with metformin hydrochloride therapy, if this is suspected, vitamin B12 deficiency should be excluded.
  <br/>
Instruct patients to inform their doctor that they are taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets prior to any surgical or radiological procedure, as temporary discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may be required until renal function has been confirmed to be normal (see PRECAUTIONS).

Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C max by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the Cmax and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when coadministered chronically.

                        <paragraph>Drugs that reduce metformin clearance—Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT2] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.</paragraph>

This represents an exposure of about 2 and 6 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin hydrochloride has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases (see WARNINGS). Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.</paragraph>

It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are used to treat type 2 diabetes. This is also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. People with type 2 diabetes are not able to make enough insulin or respond normally to the insulin their bodies make. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems including kidney damage, amputations, and blindness. Diabetes is also closely linked to heart disease. The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, by a number of medicines taken by mouth, and by insulin shots. Before you take metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, try to control your diabetes by exercise and weight loss. While you take your diabetes medicine, continue to exercise and follow the diet advised for your diabetes. No matter what your recommended diabetes management plan is, studies have shown that maintaining good blood sugar control can prevent or delay complications of diabetes, such as blindness.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Metformin hydrochloride and Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have the same active ingredient. However, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets works longer in your body. Both of these medicines help control your blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets do not cause your body to make more insulin. Because of this, when taken alone, they rarely cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and usually do not cause weight gain. However, when they are taken with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, hypoglycemia is more likely to occur, as is weight gain.
  <br/>
                     <br/>
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may not be right for you. Talk with your doctor about your choices. You should also discuss your choices with your doctor if you are nursing a child.

                     <br/>
Your doctor will tell you how much medicine to take and when to take it. You will probably start out with a low dose of the medicine. Your doctor may slowly increase your dose until your blood sugar is better controlled. You should take metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with meals.
  <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
Your doctor may have you take other medicines along with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets to control your blood sugar. These medicines may include insulin shots. Taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with insulin may help you better control your blood sugar while reducing the insulin dose.
  <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
Continue your exercise and diet program and test your blood sugar regularly while taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Your doctor will monitor your diabetes and may perform blood tests on you from time to time to make sure your kidneys and your liver are functioning normally. There is no evidence that metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets causes harm to the liver or kidneys.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Tell your doctor if you:
  <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
• have an illness that causes severe vomiting, diarrhea or fever, or if you drink a much lower amount of liquid than normal. These conditions can lead to severe dehydration (loss of
  <br/>
                     <br/>
water in your body). You may need to stop taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a short time.
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• plan to have surgery or an x-ray procedure with injection of dye (contrast agent). You may need to stop taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a short time.
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• start to take other medicines or change how you take a medicine. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets can affect how well other drugs work, and some drugs can
  <br/>
                     <br/>
affect how well metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets work. Some medicines may cause high blood sugar.

buildup of an acid in the blood) that can cause death. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in the hospital.

                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms, which could be signs of lactic acidosis:
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• you feel cold in your hands or feet
  <br/>
                     <br/>

• you feel very weak or tired
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• you have unusual (not normal) muscle pain
  <br/>
                     <br/>

                     <br/>
• you have stomach pains, nausea or vomiting
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Most people who have had lactic acidosis with metformin have other things that, combined with the metformin, led to the lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following, because you have a higher chance for getting lactic acidosis with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if you:
  <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
• have severe kidney problems, or your kidneys are affected by certain x-ray tests that use injectable dye
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• have liver problems
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• drink alcohol very often, or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term "binge" drinking
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• get dehydrated (lose a large amount of body fluids). This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Dehydration can also happen when you sweat a lot with
  <br/>
                     <br/>
activity or exercise and do not drink enough fluids
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• have surgery
  <br/>
                     <br/>
• have a heart attack, severe infection, or stroke
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>The best way to keep from having a problem with lactic acidosis from metformin is to tell your doctor if you have any of the problems in the list above. Your doctor may decide to stop your metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a while if you have any of these things.
  <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
Other Side Effects. Common side effects of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets include diarrhea, nausea, and upset stomach. These side effects generally go away after you take the medicine for a while. Taking your medicine with meals can help reduce these side effects. Tell your doctor if the side effects bother you a lot, last for more than a few weeks, come back after they’ve gone away, or start later in therapy. You may need a lower dose or need to stop taking the medicine for a short period or for good.
  <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
About 3 out of every 100 people who take metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have an unpleasant metallic taste when they start taking the medicine. It lasts for a short time.
  <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets rarely cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) by themselves. However, hypoglycemia can happen if you do not eat enough, if you drink alcohol or if you take other medicines to lower blood sugar.
