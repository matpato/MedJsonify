                  <paragraph>Chorionic gonadotropin, a gonadotropin, is a polypeptide hormone produced by the human placenta and obtained from the urine of pregnant persons. Chorionic gonadotropin is a purified preparation composed of an alpha and a beta subunit. The alpha subunit is essentially identical to the alpha subunits of the human pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), as well as to the alpha subunit of human thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The beta subunits of these hormones differ in amino acid sequence.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The action of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is virtually identical to that of pituitary LH, although hCG appears to have a small degree of FSH activity as well. It stimulates production of gonadal steroid hormones by stimulating the interstitial cells (Leydig cells) of the testis to produce androgens and the corpus luteum of the ovary to produce progesterone.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Androgen stimulation in the male leads to the development of secondary sex characteristics and may stimulate testicular descent when no anatomical impediment to descent is present. This descent is usually reversible when hCG is discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During the normal menstrual cycle, LH participates with FSH in the development and maturation of the normal ovarian follicle, and the mid-cycle LH surge triggers ovulation. hCG can substitute for LH in this function. During a normal pregnancy, hCG secreted by the placenta maintains the corpus luteum after LH secretion decreases, supporting continued secretion of estrogen and progesterone and preventing menstruation. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>HCG HAS NO KNOWN EFFECT ON FAT MOBILIZATION, APPETITE OR SENSE OF HUNGER, OR BODY FAT DISTRIBUTION.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Use hCG in conjunction with gonadotropin therapy only if the physician is experienced with infertility problems and is familiar with the criteria for patient selection, contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions described in the package insert for gonadotropins. Gonadotropin therapy, including hCG, requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, and requires the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities (see <linkHtml href="#S6">PRECAUTIONS/Laboratory Tests</linkHtml>). Safe and effective induction of ovulation with use of PREGNYL requires monitoring of ovarian response with serum estradiol and transvaginal ultrasound on a regular basis.</paragraph>

                        <br/>Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement and may progress rapidly to become a serious medical event. OHSS is characterized by a dramatic increase in vascular permeability, which can result in a rapid accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, thorax, and potentially, the pericardium. The early warning signs of the development of OHSS are severe pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight gain. Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnea, and oliguria have been reported with OHSS. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolemia, hemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, hemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic reactions. Transient liver function test abnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction with or without morphologic changes on liver biopsy, have been reported in association with OHSS. OHSS occurs after gonadotropin treatment has been discontinued and it can develop rapidly, reaching its maximum about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. <br/>
                        <br/>
							If there is evidence that OHSS may be developing prior to hCG administration, withhold hCG. Cases of OHSS are more common, more severe, and more protracted if pregnancy occurs; therefore, assess women for the development of OHSS for at least two weeks after hCG administration. <br/>
                        <br/>
							Severe OHSS may be life-threatening.<br/>
                        <br/>
							Monitor women undergoing ovarian stimulation for early signs and symptoms of OHSS. Women with known risk factors for a high ovarian response may be especially prone to the development of OHSS during or following treatment with PREGNYL.<br/>
                        <br/>
							Adherence to the recommended PREGNYL dose and treatment regimen and careful monitoring of ovarian response is important to reduce the risk of OHSS. <br/>
                        <br/>
							If serious OHSS occurs, stop gonadotropins, including hCG, and consider whether the woman should be hospitalized. Treatment is primarily symptomatic and overall consists of bed rest, fluid and electrolyte management, and analgesics (if needed). Because the use of diuretics can accentuate the diminished intravascular volume, avoid diuretics except in the late phase of resolution.<br/>
                        <br/>
							Initiate early consultation with a physician experienced in the management of OHSS and fluid and electrolyte imbalances.<br/>

                        <br/>Serious pulmonary conditions (e.g., atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome) have been reported in women treated with gonadotropins. In addition, thromboembolic reactions both in association with, and separate from OHSS have been reported following gonadotropin therapy. Intravascular thrombosis, which may originate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to vital organs or the extremities. Women with generally recognized risk factors for thrombosis, such as a personal or family history, severe obesity, or thrombophilia, may have an increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolic events, during or following treatment with gonadotropins. Sequelae of such reactions have included venous thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, cerebral vascular occlusion (stroke), and arterial occlusion resulting in loss of limb and rarely in myocardial infarction. In rare cases, pulmonary complications and/or thromboembolic reactions have resulted in death. In women with recognized risk factors, the benefits of ovulation induction, in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment need to be weighed against the risks. Pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thrombosis.<br/>

Ovarian torsion may be related to other conditions, such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian torsion, and previous or current ovarian cysts. Damage to the ovary due to reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion.<br/>

                        <br/> The incidence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, sperm characteristics) and to the higher incidence of multiple gestations after ART. There are no indications that the use of gonadotropins during ART is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations.<br/>

                        <br/> There have been infrequent reports of ovarian neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug therapy for ovarian stimulation; however, a causal relationship has not been established.<br/>

                        <br/>Induction of androgen secretion by hCG may cause fluid retention. <br/>
					Use hCG with caution in patients with cardiac or renal disease, hypertension, epilepsy, migraine, or asthma.<br/>
                        <br/>Careful attention should be given to the diagnosis of infertility in candidates for hCG therapy (see <linkHtml href="#S3">INDICATIONS AND USAGE</linkHtml>).

                        <br/>Prior to therapy with hCG, patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and monitoring of their condition that will be required. The risks of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and multiple births in women (see <linkHtml href="#S5">WARNINGS</linkHtml>) and other possible adverse reactions (see <linkHtml href="#S8">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>) should also be discussed.<br/>

                        <br/>In most instances, treatment of women with FSH results only in follicular recruitment and development. In the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG is given when monitoring of the patient indicates that sufficient follicular development has occurred. This may be estimated by pelvic ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels. The combination of both pelvic ultrasound and serum estradiol measurement are useful for monitoring the development of follicles, for timing of the ovulatory trigger, as well as for detecting ovarian enlargement and minimizing the risk of the Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome and multiple gestation. Confirm the number of growing follicles using ultrasonography because serum estrogens do not give an indication of the size or number of follicles. </item>

                  <paragraph>Human chorionic gonadotropins can crossreact in the radioimmunoassay of gonadotropins, especially luteinizing hormone.
