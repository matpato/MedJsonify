                     <title>5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including esomeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules consider alternative anti-platelet therapy <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#_RefID52">7</linkHtml>)].</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#ID50">6.2</linkHtml>)].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID85">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules was evaluated in over 15,000 patients (aged 18 to 84 years) in clinical trials worldwide including over 8,500 patients in the United States and over 6,500 patients in Europe and Canada. Over 2,900 patients were treated in long-term studies for up to 6 to 12 months. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety in the treatment of healing of EE in adults was assessed in four randomized comparative clinical trials, which included 1,240 patients who received esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 20 mg once daily, 2,434 patients on esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg once daily, and 3,008 patients on omeprazole 20 mg once daily. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (at least 1%) in all three groups were headache (5.5%, 5%, and 3.8%, respectively) and diarrhea (no difference among the three groups). Nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, and dry mouth occurred at similar rates among patients taking esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules or omeprazole.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules in pregnant women. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Available epidemiologic data fail to demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with first trimester omeprazole use (see Data). Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits resulted in dose-dependent embryo-lethality at omeprazole doses that were approximately 3.4 to 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg (based on a body surface area for a 60 kg person).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Teratogenicity was not observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of oral esomeprazole magnesium in rats and rabbits with doses about 68 times and 42 times, respectively, an oral human dose of 40 mg (based on a body surface area basis for a 60 kg person). Changes in bone morphology were observed in offspring of rats dosed through most of pregnancy and lactation at doses equal to or greater than approximately 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg. When maternal administration was confined to gestation only, there were no effects on bone physeal morphology in the offspring at any age (see Data).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Four epidemiological studies compared the frequency of congenital abnormalities among infants born to women who used omeprazole during pregnancy with the frequency of abnormalities among infants of women exposed to H2-receptor antagonists or other controls.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A population-based retrospective cohort epidemiological study from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, covering approximately 99% of pregnancies, from 1995 to 1999, reported on 955 infants (824 exposed during the first trimester with 39 of these exposed beyond first trimester, and 131 exposed after the first trimester) whose mothers used omeprazole during pregnancy. The number of infants exposed in utero to omeprazole that had any malformation, low birth weight, low Apgar score, or hospitalization was similar to the number observed in this population. The number of infants born with ventricular septal defects and the number of stillborn infants was slightly higher in the omeprazole-exposed infants than the expected number in this population.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2009, reported on 1,800 live births whose mothers used omeprazole during the first trimester of pregnancy and 837,317 live births whose mothers did not use any proton pump inhibitor. The overall rate of birth defects in infants born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole was 2.9% and 2.6% in infants born to mothers not exposed to any proton pump inhibitor during the first trimester.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A retrospective cohort study reported on 689 pregnant women exposed to either H2-blockers or omeprazole in the first trimester (134 exposed to omeprazole) and 1,572 pregnant women unexposed to either during the first trimester. The overall malformation rate in offspring born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole, an H2-blocker, or were unexposed was 3.6%, 5.5%, and 4.1% respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A small prospective observational cohort study followed 113 women exposed to omeprazole during pregnancy (89% with first trimester exposures). The reported rate of major congenital malformations was 4% in the omeprazole group, 2% in controls exposed to non-teratogens, and 2.8% in disease paired controls. Rates of spontaneous and elective abortions, preterm deliveries, gestational age at delivery, and mean birth weight were similar among the groups.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Several studies have reported no apparent adverse short-term effects on the infant when single dose oral or intravenous omeprazole was administered to over 200 pregnant women as premedication for cesarean section under general anesthesia.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Reproductive studies conducted with omeprazole in rats at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at doses up to 69.1 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) during organogenesis did not disclose any evidence for a teratogenic potential of omeprazole. In rabbits, omeprazole in a dose range of 6.9 to 69.1 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) administered during organogenesis produced dose-related increases in embryo-lethality, fetal resorptions, and pregnancy disruptions. In rats, dose-related embryo/fetal toxicity and postnatal developmental toxicity were observed in offspring resulting from parents treated with omeprazole at 13.8 to 138.0 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), administered prior to mating through the lactation period.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in reproduction studies with esomeprazole magnesium in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) or in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 41 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) administered during organogenesis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Neonatal/early postnatal (birth to weaning) survival was decreased at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Body weight and body weight gain were reduced and neurobehavioral or general developmental delays in the immediate post-weaning timeframe were evident at doses equal to or greater than 69 mg/kg/day (about 17 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). In addition, decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses equal to or greater than 14 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Physeal dysplasia in the femur was observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of esomeprazole magnesium at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in a pre- and postnatal toxicity study when esomeprazole magnesium was administered at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A pre- and postnatal development study in rats with esomeprazole strontium (using equimolar doses compared to esomeprazole magnesium study) produced similar results in dams and pups as described above.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A follow up developmental toxicity study in rats with further time points to evaluate pup bone development from postnatal day 2 to adulthood was performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) where esomeprazole administration was from either gestational day 7 or gestational day 16 until parturition. When maternal administration was confined to gestation only, there were no effects on bone physeal morphology in the offspring at any age.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The active ingredient in the proton pump inhibitor esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules for oral administration is bis(5-methoxy-2-[(S)-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1<content styleCode="italics">H</content>-benzimidazole-1-yl) magnesium trihydrate. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole, which is a mixture of the S- and R- isomers. (Initial U.S. approval of esomeprazole magnesium: 2001). Its molecular formula is (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>18</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>S)<sub>2 </sub>Mg x 3 H<sub>2</sub>O with molecular weight of 767.17 as a trihydrate and 713.1 on an anhydrous basis. The structural formula is:</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The magnesium salt is a white or slightly colored powder. It contains 3 moles of water of solvation and is slightly soluble in methanol, insoluble in water and in n-Heptane. The stability of esomeprazole magnesium is a function of pH; it rapidly degrades in acidic media, but it has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions. At pH 6.8 (buffer), the half-life of the magnesium salt is about 19 hours at 25°C and about 8 hours at 37°C.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules are supplied in delayed-release capsules. Each delayed-release capsule contains 20 mg, or 40 mg of esomeprazole (present as 22.25 mg, or 44.50 mg esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate) in the form of enteric-coated granules with the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose 2910, magnesium stearate, methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate copolymer dispersion, mono-and di-glycerides, polysorbate 80, sugar spheres, talc and triethyl citrate. The capsule shells have the following inactive ingredients: gelatin, sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide. The imprinting ink also contains ferric oxide black, shellac, strong ammonium solution, potassium hydroxide and propylene glycol. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole is protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, esomeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules showed similar bioavailability after a single dose (40 mg) administration in 94 healthy male and female subjects under fasting conditions. After oral administration, peak plasma levels (C<sub>max</sub>) of esomeprazole occur at approximately 1.5 hours (T<sub>max</sub>). The C<sub>max</sub> increases proportionally when the dose is increased, and there is a three-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 20 mg to 40 mg. At repeated once-daily dosing with 40 mg, the systemic bioavailability is approximately 90% compared to 64% after a single dose of 40 mg. The mean exposure (AUC) to esomeprazole increases from 4.32 μmol*hr/L on Day 1 to 11.2 μmol*hr/L on Day 5 after 40 mg once daily dosing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The AUC after administration of a single 40 mg dose of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules are decreased by 43% to 53% after food intake compared to fasting conditions <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID417">2.3</linkHtml>)]</content>. The pharmacokinetics profile of esomeprazole in adult patients with symptomatic GERD following repeated once daily administration of 20 mg and 40 mg esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules over a period of five days are shown in Table 6:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The metabolites of esomeprazole lack antisecretory activity. The major part of esomeprazole's metabolism is dependent upon the CYP2C19 isoenzyme, which forms the hydroxy and desmethyl metabolites. The remaining amount is dependent on CYP3A4 which forms the sulphone metabolite.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The plasma elimination half-life of esomeprazole is approximately 1 to 1.5 hours. Less than 1% of parent drug is excreted in the urine. Approximately 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as inactive metabolites in the urine, and the remainder is found as inactive metabolites in the feces.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules were studied in 28 adolescent patients with GERD aged 12 to 17 years inclusive, in a single center study. Patients were randomized to receive esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 20 mg or 40 mg once daily for 8 days. Mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values of esomeprazole were not affected by body weight or age; and more than dose-proportional increases in mean Cmax and AUC values were observed between the two dose groups in the study. Overall, esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules pharmacokinetics in adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years were similar to those observed in adult patients with symptomatic GERD.

                        <paragraph>CYP2C19, a polymorphic enzyme, is involved in the metabolism of esomeprazole. The CYP2C19*1 allele is fully functional while the CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles are nonfunctional. There are other alleles associated with no or reduced enzymatic function. Patients carrying two fully functional alleles are extensive metabolizers and those carrying two loss-of-function alleles are poor metabolizers. The systemic exposure to esomeprazole varies with a patient's metabolism status: poor metabolizers &gt; intermediate metabolizers &gt; extensive metabolizers. Approximately 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Systemic esomeprazole exposures were modestly higher (approximately 17%) in CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers (IM; n=6) compared to extensive metabolizers (EM; n=17) of CYP2C19. Similar pharmacokinetic differences were noted across these genotypes in a study of Chinese healthy subjects that included 7 EMs and 11 IMs. There is very limited pharmacokinetic information for poor metabolizers (PM) from these studies. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At steady state following once daily administration of esomeprazole 40 mg, the ratio of AUC in poor metabolizers to AUC in the rest of the population (EMs) is approximately 1.5. This change in exposure is not considered clinically meaningful.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The carcinogenic potential of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules was assessed using studies of omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer. In two 24-month oral carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44, and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.4 to 34 times the human dose of 40 mg/day expressed on a body surface area basis) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) for 1 year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of 1 year (94% treated vs. 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs. 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for 2 years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. A 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole was negative in the Ames mutation test, in the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> rat bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> mouse micronucleus test. Esomeprazole, however, was positive in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test. Omeprazole was positive in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> mouse bone marrow cell chromosome aberration test, and the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> mouse micronucleus test.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The potential effects of esomeprazole on fertility and reproductive performance were assessed using omeprazole studies. Omeprazole at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day in rats (about 34 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) was found to have no effect on reproductive performance of parental animals.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 28-day toxicity study with a 14-day recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats with esomeprazole magnesium at doses of 70 to 280 mg /kg/day (about 17 to 68 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). An increase in the number of deaths at the high dose of 280 mg/kg/day was observed when juvenile rats were administered esomeprazole magnesium from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 35. In addition, doses equal to or greater than 140 mg/kg/day (about 34 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), produced treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length, and affected overall growth. Comparable findings described above have also been observed in this study with another esomeprazole salt, esomeprazole strontium, at equimolar doses of esomeprazole.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.5 Risk Reduction of NSAID-Associated Gastric Ulcer</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in adult patients at risk of developing gastric and/or duodenal ulcers associated with continuous use of non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs. A total of 1,429 patients were randomized across the 2 studies. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 89 (median age 66 years) with 71% female, 29% male, 83% Caucasian, 5% Black, 4% Asian, and 8% Others. At baseline, the patients in these studies were endoscopically confirmed not to have ulcers but were determined to be at risk for ulcer occurrence due to their age (at least 60 years) and/or history of a documented gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. Patients receiving NSAIDs and treated with esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 20 mg or 40 mg once daily experienced significant reduction in gastric ulcer occurrences relative to placebo treatment at 26 weeks. See Table 13. No additional benefit was seen with esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg over esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 20 mg. Esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg once daily is not recommended regimen for the risk reduction of NSAID-associated gastric ulcer in adults. These studies did not demonstrate significant reduction in the development of NSAID-associated duodenal ulcer due to the low incidence.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies were conducted in adult patients using a 10-day treatment regimen of triple therapy (esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin and clarithromycin). The first study (191) compared esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg once daily in combination with amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily to esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg once daily plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily. The second study (193) compared esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg once daily in combination with amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily to esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg once daily. <content styleCode="italics">H. pylori</content> eradication rates, defined as at least two negative tests and no positive tests from CLOtest<sup>®</sup>, histology and/or culture, at 4 weeks post-therapy were significantly higher in the esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin group than in the esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules and clarithromycin group or esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules alone group. The results are shown in Table 14:</paragraph>

                     <title>14.7 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome in Adults</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In a multicenter, open-label dose-escalation study of 21 adult patients (15 males and 6 females, 18 Caucasian and 3 Black, mean age of 56 years) with pathological hypersecretory conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion. The initial dosage of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules was 40 mg twice daily in 19 patients and 80 mg twice daily in 2 patients. Total daily doses ranging from 80 mg to 240 mg for 12 months maintained gastric acid output below the target levels of 10 mEq/h in patients without prior gastric acid-reducing surgery and below 5 mEq/hr in patients with prior gastric acid-reducing surgery. At the Month 12 final visit, 18/20 (90%) patients had Basal Acid Output (BAO) under satisfactory control (median BAO = 0.17 mmol/hr). Of the 18 patients evaluated with a starting dose of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules 40 mg twice daily, 13 (72%) had their BAO controlled with the original dosing regimen at the final visit. See Table 15.</paragraph>
