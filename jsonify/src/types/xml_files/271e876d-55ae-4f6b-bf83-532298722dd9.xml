                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam extended-release tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe alprazolam extended-release tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of alprazolam extended-release tablets than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking alprazolam extended-release tablets, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when alprazolam extended-release tablets is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_7.1">Drug Interactions (7.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam extended-release tablets, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_9.2">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Before prescribing alprazolam extended-release tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of alprazolam extended-release tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of alprazolam extended-release tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam extended-release tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_2.3">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The continued use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam extended-release tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam extended-release tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_9.3">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_9.3">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to alprazolam extended-release tablets. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)]</content>. Even after relatively short-term use at doses of <content styleCode="underline">&lt;</content> 4 mg/day, there is some risk of dependence. Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of dependence and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg/day and for long periods (more than 12 weeks). However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients who received alprazolam, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. In contrast, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than those treated with less than 4 mg/day.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss. Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Early morning anxiety and emergence of anxiety symptoms between doses of alprazolam have been reported in patients with panic disorder taking prescribed maintenance doses. These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose. In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound, or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval.</paragraph>

In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects, patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur, alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder, a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability, hostility, and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco, and other medications, have not confirmed these findings. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Alprazolam extended-release tablets are a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.  Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Alprazolam extended-release tablets may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used.<br/>

               <title>10 OVERDOSAGE</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Consider contacting the Poison Help Line at (1-800-222-1222), or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Alprazolam is a 1,4 benzodiazepine. Alprazolam exerts its effect for the treatment of panic disorder through binding to the benzodiazepine site of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors in the brain and enhances GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam and two of its major active metabolites (4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam) are linear, and concentrations are proportional up to 10 mg alprazolam extended-release tablets given once daily.</paragraph>

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Following oral administration of alprazolam extended-release tablets in the morning, peak plasma concentration of alprazolam (C<sub>max</sub>) occurs in about 10 hours postdose. Compared to morning dosing, alprazolam C<sub>max</sub> increased by 30% and the T<sub>max</sub> decreased by an hour following dosing at night.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The mean absolute bioavailability of alprazolam following administration of alprazolam extended-release tablets is approximately 90%, and the relative bioavailability compared to alprazolam is about 100%. The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of alprazolam following administration of alprazolam extended-release tablets are similar to that for alprazolam, with the exception of a slower rate of absorption.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A high-fat meal given up to 2 hours before dosing with alprazolam extended-release tablets increased the mean C<sub>max</sub> by about 25%. The effect of this meal on T<sub>max</sub> depended on the timing of the meal, with a reduction in T<sub>max</sub> by about 1/3 for subjects eating immediately before dosing and an increase in T<sub>max</sub> by about 1/3 for subjects eating 1 hour or more after dosing. The extent of exposure (AUC) and elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) were not affected by eating.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution of alprazolam is similar for alprazolam extended-release tablets and alprazolam. Alprazolam is 80% bound to human serum protein, and albumin accounts for the majority of the binding.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mean plasma elimination half-life of alprazolam following administration of alprazolam extended-release tablets ranges from 10.7 to 15.8 hours in healthy adults.</paragraph>

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), to two major active metabolites in the plasma: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. The plasma circulation levels of the two active metabolites after both alprazolam extended-release tablets and alprazolam are less than 10% and 4% of the parent, respectively. The reported relative potencies in benzodiazepine receptor binding experiments and in animal models of induced seizure inhibition are 0.20 and 0.66, respectively, for 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they unlikely contribute much to the effects of alprazolam. A benzophenone derived from alprazolam is also found in humans. Their half-lives appear to be similar to that of alprazolam. The pharmacokinetic parameters at steady-state for the two hydroxylated metabolites of alprazolam (4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam) were similar for alprazolam and alprazolam extended-release tablets, indicating that the metabolism of alprazolam is not affected by absorption rate.<br/>

                  <paragraph>The efficacy of alprazolam extended-release tablets in the treatment of panic disorder in adults was established in two 6-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies in adult patients meeting DSM-III criteria for panic disorder. In these studies, patients were treated with alprazolam extended-release tablets in a dose range of 1 mg to 10 mg once per day. The effectiveness of alprazolam extended-release tablets was assessed on the basis of changes in various measures of panic attack frequency, on various measures of the Clinical Global Impression, and on the Overall Phobia Scale. In all, there were 7 primary efficacy measures in these studies, and alprazolam extended-release tablets was superior to placebo on all 7 outcomes in both studies. The mean dose of alprazolam extended-release tablets at the last treatment visit was 4.2 mg per day in the first study and 4.6 mg per day in the second.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In addition, there were two 8-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled studies of alprazolam extended-release tablets in adult patients with panic disorder, involving fixed alprazolam extended-release tablets doses of 4 mg and 6 mg/ once per day that did not show a benefit for either dose of alprazolam extended-release tablets.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and gender did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender.</paragraph>
