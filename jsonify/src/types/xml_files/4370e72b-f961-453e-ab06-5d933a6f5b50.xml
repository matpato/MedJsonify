This day is known as the âPatch Change Day.â For example, if the first patch is applied on a Monday, all subsequent patches should be applied on a Monday.

                        <paragraph>On the day after Week Four ends, a new four-week cycle is started by applying a new patch. Under no circumstances should there be more than a seven-day patch-free interval between dosing cycles. </paragraph>

In case of breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, consider nonfunctional causes. In case of undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another method of contraception may solve the problem. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The use of CHCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs. The risk of VTE may be greater with ZAFEMY in women with a BMI â¥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> compared to women with a lower BMI <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_de4f5cbe-4dc5-40d1-b25a-f3dc7c22fca5">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While the risk of VTE associated with the use of CHCs is well-established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 1). The frequency of VTE in women using CHCs has been estimated to be 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 woman-years. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of CHCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. This initial higher risk declines during the first year, but users of CHCs remain at an increased risk of VTE compared to non-users of CHCs. Based on results from a few studies, there is some evidence that this is true for non-oral products as well. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to CHCs gradually disappears after CHC use is discontinued. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for women who use CHCs with a range of doses and routes of administration, for pregnant women, and for women in the post-partum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in women using ZAFEMY. Consider non-hormonal causes and take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out malignancy, other pathology, or pregnancy in the event of unscheduled bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology and pregnancy have been excluded, time or a change to another contraceptive product may resolve the bleeding. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the clinical trials, most women started their scheduled (withdrawal) bleeding on the fourth day of the drug-free interval, and the median duration of withdrawal bleeding was 5 to 6 days. On average, 26% of women per cycle had 7 or more total days of bleeding and/or spotting (this includes both scheduled and unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting). Three clinical studies of the efficacy of ZAFEMY in preventing pregnancy assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_363c6c48-31c3-4c94-8632-ada1874db5ec">Clinical Studies (14)</linkHtml>]</content> in 3,330 women who completed 22,155 cycles of exposure. A total of 36 (1.1%) of the women discontinued ZAFEMY at least in part, due to bleeding or spotting. </paragraph>

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (&lt;6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_e309f941-c8af-4f5f-addd-bf4f4505f05e">Postmarketing Experience (6.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.<br/>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The data described below reflect exposure to ZAFEMY in 3,330 sexually active women (3,322 of whom had safety data) who participated in three Phase 3 clinical trials designed to evaluate contraceptive efficacy and safety. These subjects received six or 13 cycles of contraception (ZAFEMY or an oral contraceptive comparator in 2 of the trials). The women ranged in age from 18 to 45 years and were predominantly white (91%). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse reactions (â¥ 5%) reported during clinical trials were breast symptoms, nausea/vomiting, headache, application site disorder, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginal bleeding and menstrual disorders, and mood, affect and anxiety disorders. The most common events leading to discontinuation were application site reaction, breast symptoms (including breast discomfort, engorgement and pain), nausea and/or vomiting, headache and emotional lability. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse drug reactions reported by â¥ 2.5% of Â ZAFEMY-treated subjects in these trials are shown in Table 3.<br/>

                        <paragraph>Five studies that compared breast cancer risk between ever-users (current or past use) of COCs and never-users of COCs reported no association between ever use of COCs and breast cancer risk, with effect estimates ranging from 0.90 to 1.12 (Figure 2).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users (&lt;6 months since last use) and never users of COCs (Figure 2). One of these studies reported no association between breast cancer risk and COC use. The other two studies found an increased relative risk of 1.19 to 1.33 with current or recent use. Both of these studies found an increased risk of breast cancer with current use of longer duration, with relative risks ranging from 1.03 with less than one year of COC use to approximately 1.4 with more than 8 to 10 years of COC use.<br/>

                        <paragraph>Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of CHCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. Johnâs wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>CHCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. CHCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, and temazepam. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>ZAFEMY is a transdermal system with a contact surface area of 12.5 cm<sup>2</sup>. It contains 3.15 mg norelgestromin, USP (NGMN) and 0.289 mg ethinyl estradiol, USP (EE), and its delivery rate is approximately 150 mcg of NGMN, USP and 35 mcg of EE, USP per day. Systemic exposures (as measured by area under the curve [AUC] and steady-state concentration [C<sub>ss</sub>]) of NGMN, USP and EE, USP during use of ZAFEMY are higher and the C<sub>max</sub> is lower than those produced by an oral contraceptive containing norgestimate, USP (NGM) 250 mcg / EE, USP 35 mcg <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2ef65fbe-29f0-482f-9a00-690b9781675c">Boxed Warning</linkHtml>Â </content>andÂ <content styleCode="italics">

                  <paragraph>ZAFEMY is a thin, matrix-type transdermal system consisting of three layers. <content styleCode="underline">The backing layer</content> is composed of a tan backing consisting of pigmented polyethylene and polyester. It provides structural support and protects the middle adhesive layer from the environment. <content styleCode="underline">The middle layer</content> contains polyisobutylene/polybutene adhesive, polybutene, crospovidone, oleyl alcohol and dipropylene glycol as inactive components. The active components in this layer are the hormones, NGMN, USP and EE, USP. <content styleCode="underline">The third layer is the release liner</content>, which protects the adhesive layer during storage and is removed just prior to application. It is a transparent polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film with a silicone coating on the side that is in contact with the middle adhesive layer. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The outside of the backing layer is printed with âNorelgestromin and Ethinyl Estradiol 150/35 mcg per dayâ in brown ink. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NGMN is the active progestin largely responsible for the progestational activity that occurs in women following application of ZAFEMY. NGMN is also the primary active metabolite produced following oral administration of NGM, the progestin component of some oral contraceptive products. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Combination hormonal contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Absorption </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The systemic delivery rate of NGMN and EE from ZAFEMY is approximately 150 mcg of NGMN and 35 mcg of EE per day based on a comparative analysis with intravenous (IV) data. Following a single application of ZAFEMY, both NGMN and EE reach a plateau by approximately 48 hours. Pooled data from the 3 clinical studies have demonstrated that steady-state is reached within 2 weeks of application. In one of the clinical studies, C<sub>ss</sub> concentrations across all subjects ranged from 0.305 to 1.53 ng/mL for NGMN and from 23 to 137 pg/mL for EE. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Absorption of NGMN and EE following application of ZAFEMY to the buttock, upper outer arm, abdomen and upper torso (excluding breast) was examined. While absorption from the abdomen was slightly lower than from other sites, absorption from these anatomic sites was considered to be therapeutically equivalent. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean (%CV) PK parameters C<sub>ss</sub> and AUC<sub>0-168</sub> for NGMN and EE following a single buttock application of ZAFEMY are summarized in Table 5. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In multiple dose studies, AUC<sub>0-168</sub> for NGMN and EE was found to increase over time (Table 5). In a three-cycle study, these PK parameters reached steady-state conditions during Cycle 3 (Figures 5 and 4). Upon removal of the patch, serum levels of EE and NGMN reach very low or non-measurable levels within 3 days.<br/>

                        <paragraph>Results from a study of consecutive ZAFEMY wear for 7 days and 10 days indicated that serum concentrations of NGMN and EE dropped slightly during the first 6 hours after the patch replacement, and recovered within 12 hours. By Day 10 of patch administration, both NGMN and EE concentrations had decreased by approximately 25% when compared to Day 7 concentrations. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Since Â norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol are delivered transdermally, first-pass metabolism (via the gastrointestinal tract and/or liver) of NGMN and EE that would be expected with oral administration does not occur. Hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include norgestrel, which is highly bound to SHBG, and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NGMN and norgestrel (a serum metabolite of NGMN) are highly bound (&gt;97%) to serum proteins. NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG, while norgestrel is bound primarily to SHBG, which limits its biological activity. EE is extensively bound to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG (see Table 5). </paragraph>

Under steady-state conditions, AUC<sub>0-168</sub> and C<sub>ss</sub> for EE were approximately 55% and 60% higher, respectively, for the transdermal patch, and the C<sub>max</sub> was about 35% higher for the oral contraceptive, respectively. Inter-subject variability (%CV) for the PK parameters following delivery from ZAFEMY was higher relative to the variability determined from the oral contraceptive. The mean PK profiles are different between the two products and caution should be exercised when making a direct comparison of these PK parameters. </paragraph>

For both NGMN and EE, increasing age, body weight and body surface area each were associated with slight decreases in C<sub>ss</sub> and AUC values. However, only a small fraction (10% to 25%) of the overall variability in the PK of NGMN and EE following application of ZAFEMY may be associated with any or all of the above demographic parameters. There was no significant effect of race with respect to Caucasians, Hispanics and Blacks. </paragraph>

                           <item>Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combined hormonal contraceptive use, and that women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use combined hormonal contraceptives. </item>
                           <item>The use of CHCs increases the risk of VTE. However, pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of CHCs. The risk of VTE in women using CHCs is 3 to 12 cases per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of CHCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to CHCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued. </item>

                           <item>Amenorrhea may occur. Consider pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea. Rule out pregnancy in the event of amenorrhea in two or more consecutive cycles, amenorrhea in one cycle if the woman has not adhered to the dosing schedule, or if associated with symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. </item>

She should start a new cycle immediately by applying a new patch.

This increased risk is highest when you first start using hormonal birth control and when you restart the same or different hormonal birth control after not using it for a month or more. Some studies have reported that women who use ZAFEMY have a higher risk of getting a blood clot. Talk with your healthcare provider about your risk of getting a blood clot before using ZAFEMY or deciding which type of birth control is right for you.</item>

                              <paragraph>It is not known if hormonal birth control causes breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>
                                 <br/>If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.</paragraph>

                                 <br/>Women who use hormonal birth control methods may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.Â <br/>

                              <paragraph>When you use ZAFEMY you may have bleeding and spotting between periods, called unplanned bleeding. Unplanned bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Unplanned bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of ZAFEMY use, but may also occur after you have been using the patch for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue using the patch on schedule. If the unplanned bleeding or spotting is heavy or lasts for more than a few days, you should discuss this with your healthcare provider. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Some women miss periods on hormonal birth control, even when they are not pregnant. However, if you go 2 or more months in a row without a period, or you miss your period after a month where you did not use all of your patches correctly, or you have symptoms associated with pregnancy, such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness, call your healthcare provider because you may be pregnant. Stop taking ZAFEMY if you are pregnant. </paragraph>
