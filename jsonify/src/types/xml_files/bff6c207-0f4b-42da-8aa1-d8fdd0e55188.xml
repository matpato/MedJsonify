                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1,000 patients treated are provided in <content styleCode="bold">Table 1.</content>

                        <paragraph>It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing escitalopram tablets, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>SSRIs, including Escitalopram tablets, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID26">4</linkHtml>) and Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID71">7</linkHtml>)].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination) seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The concomitant use of Escitalopram tablets with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Escitalopram tablets in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Escitalopram tablets, discontinue Escitalopram tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID26">4</linkHtml>) and Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID20">2.7</linkHtml>)].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor all patients taking Escitalopram tablets for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Escitalopram tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Escitalopram tablets with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>During marketing of Escitalopram tablets and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Escitalopram tablets. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID18">2.6</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph>Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram tablets or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram tablets in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one (0.1%) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram tablets and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram tablets treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram tablets, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID14">2.4</linkHtml>)].</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including escitalopram. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and was reversible when escitalopram was discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk [<content styleCode="italics">see</content> <content styleCode="italics">Geriatric Use (<linkHtml href="#ID121">8.5</linkHtml>
                           </content>)]. Discontinuation of escitalopram should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Escitalopram tablets, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage <content styleCode="italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]</content>. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Escitalopram tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants.

                        <paragraph>In a study in normal volunteers, escitalopram 10 mg/day did not produce impairment of intellectual function or psychomotor performance. Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that escitalopram therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Clinical experience with Escitalopram tablets in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using Escitalopram tablets in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses.</paragraph>

Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased.

                        <paragraph>Use of SSRIs, including escitalopram tablets, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [<content styleCode="italics">see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#ID59">6.1</linkHtml>)</content>]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of escitalopram tablets and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions information for escitalopram was collected from 715 patients with major depressive disorder who were exposed to escitalopram and from 592 patients who were exposed to placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. An additional 284 patients with major depressive disorder were newly exposed to escitalopram in open-label trials. The adverse event information for escitalopram in patients with GAD was collected from 429 patients exposed to escitalopram and from 427 patients exposed to placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization (WHO) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. </paragraph>

In two fixed-dose studies, the rate of discontinuation for adverse reactions in patients receiving 10 mg/day escitalopram was not significantly different from the rate of discontinuation for adverse reactions in patients receiving placebo. The rate of discontinuation for adverse reactions in patients assigned to a fixed dose of 20 mg/day escitalopram was 10%, which was significantly different from the rate of discontinuation for adverse reactions in patients receiving 10 mg/day escitalopram (4%) and placebo (3%). Adverse reactions that were associated with the discontinuation of at least 1% of patients treated with escitalopram, and for which the rate was at least twice that of placebo, were nausea (2%) and ejaculation disorder (2% of male patients).</paragraph>

However, the following adverse reactions (excluding those which appear in Table 2 and those for which the coded terms were uninformative or misleading) were reported at an incidence of at least 2% for escitalopram tablets and greater than placebo: back pain, urinary tract infection, vomiting, and nasal congestion.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The potential dose dependency of common adverse reactions (defined as an incidence rate of ≥5% in either the 10 mg or 20 mg escitalopram groups) was examined on the basis of the combined incidence of adverse reactions in two fixed-dose trials. The overall incidence rates of adverse reactions in 10 mg escitalopram-treated patients (66%) was similar to that of the placebo-treated patients (61%), while the incidence rate in 20 mg/day escitalopram-treated patients was greater (86%). Table 4 shows common adverse reactions that occurred in the 20 mg/day escitalopram group with an incidence that was approximately twice that of the 10 mg/day escitalopram group and approximately twice that of the placebo group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Escitalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to (1) mean change from baseline in vital signs (pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) and (2) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with escitalopram treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures in subjects receiving escitalopram indicated that escitalopram treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Electrocardiograms from escitalopram (N=625) and placebo (N=527) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline (tachycardic or bradycardic outliers, respectively). None of the patients in the escitalopram group had a QTcF interval &gt;500 msec or a prolongation &gt;60 msec compared to 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.2% in the escitalopram and the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.5% in the escitalopram group and 0.2% in the placebo group. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 (6.4) and 10.7 (12.7) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm (95% confidence interval) under the Cmax for the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 (7.9) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean Cmax of 1.7-fold higher than the mean Cmax for the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state (20 mg). The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Neonates exposed to SSRIs or SNRIs, including escitalopram tablets, late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [<content styleCode="italics">see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID38">5.2</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a rat embryo/fetal development study, oral administration of escitalopram (56, 112, or 150 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and associated delays in ossification at the two higher doses [approximately ≥ 55 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis]. Maternal toxicity (clinical signs and decreased body weight gain and food consumption), mild at 56 mg/kg/day, was present at all dose levels. The developmental no-effect dose of 56 mg/kg/day is approximately 27 times the MRHD of 20 mg on a mg/m<sup>2</sup>basis. No malformations were observed at any of the doses tested (as high as 73 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When female rats were treated with escitalopram (6, 12, 24, or 48 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy and through weaning, slightly increased offspring mortality and growth retardation were noted at 48 mg/kg/day which is approximately 23 times the MRHD of 20 mg on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. Slight maternal toxicity (clinical signs and decreased body weight gain and food consumption) was seen at this dose. Slightly increased offspring mortality was also seen at 24 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose was 12 mg/kg/day which is approximately 6 times the MRHD of 20 mg on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In two rat embryo/fetal development studies, oral administration of racemic citalopram (32, 56, or 112 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects) at the high dose, which is approximately 18 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day on a mg/ m<sup>2</sup> basis. This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity (clinical signs, decreased body weight gain). The developmental no-effect dose was 56 mg/kg/day is approximately 9 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. In a rabbit study, no adverse effects on embryo/fetal development were observed at doses of racemic citalopram of up to 16 mg/kg/day, or approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. Thus, developmental effects of racemic citalopram were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When female rats were treated with racemic citalopram (4.8, 12.8, or 32 mg/kg/day) from late gestation through weaning, increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days after birth and persistent offspring growth retardation were observed at the highest dose, which is approximately 5 times the MRHD of 60 mg on a mg/m<sup>2</sup>basis. The no-effect dose was 12.8 mg/kg/day is approximately 2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup>basis. Similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses ≥ 24 mg/kg/day, approximately 4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup>basis. A no-effect dose was not determined in that study.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a juvenile animal study, male and female rats were administered escitalopram at 5, 40, or 80 mg/kg/day by oral gavage from postnatal day (PND) 21 to PND 69. A delay in sexual maturation was observed in both males and females at ≥ 40 mg/kg/day with a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 5 mg/kg/day. This NOAEL was associated with plasma AUC levels less than those measured at the maximum recommended dose (MRHD) in pediatrics (20 mg). However, there was no effect on reproductive function. Increased motor activity (both ambulatory and fine movements) was observed in females prior to daily dosing at ≥ 40 mg/kg/day (3.5 times the MRHD based on AUC levels). A reversible disruption of learning and memory function was observed in males at 80 mg/kg/day with a NOAEL of 40 mg/kg/day, which was associated with an AUC level 3.5 times those measured at the MRHD in pediatrics. There was no effect on learning and memory function in treated female rats.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Approximately 69 patients (6%) of the 1,144 patients receiving escitalopram in controlled trials of Escitalopram tablets in major depressive disorder and GAD were 60 years of age or older <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#ID147">14.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID149">14.2</linkHtml>)]. </content>The number of elderly patients in these trials was insufficient to adequately assess for possible differential efficacy and safety measures on the basis of age.

                        <paragraph>Animal studies suggest that the abuse liability of racemic citalopram is low. Escitalopram has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. The premarketing clinical experience with escitalopram did not reveal any drug-seeking behavior. However, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate escitalopram patients for history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose, drug-seeking behavior).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mechanism of antidepressant action of escitalopram, the S-enantiomer of racemic citalopram, is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> studies in animals suggest that escitalopram is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. Escitalopram is at least 100-fold more potent than the R-enantiomer with respect to inhibition of 5-HT reuptake and inhibition of 5-HT neuronal firing rate. Tolerance to a model of antidepressant effect in rats was not induced by long-term (up to 5 weeks) treatment with escitalopram. Escitalopram has no or very low affinity for serotonergic (5-HT<sub>1-7</sub>) or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine (D<sub>1-5</sub>), histamine (H<sub>1-3</sub>), muscarinic (M<sub>1-5</sub>), and benzodiazepine receptors. Escitalopram also does not bind to, or has low affinity for, various ion channels including Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, and Ca<sup>++</sup> channels. Antagonism of muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular side effects of other psychotropic drugs. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of escitalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of escitalopram in plasma in young healthy subjects was 2.2-2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The absolute bioavailability of citalopram is about 80% relative to an intravenous dose. The tablet and the oral solution dosage forms of escitalopram oxalate are bioequivalent.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet or solution) of escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours. Absorption of escitalopram is not affected by food.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The binding of escitalopram to human plasma proteins is approximately 56%. The volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg. Data specific on escitalopram are unavailable.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Biotransformation of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 27-32 hours. The oral clearance of escitalopram is 600 mL/min, with approximately 7% of that due to renal clearance.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Escitalopram is metabolized to S-DCT and S-didemethylcitalopram (S-DDCT). In humans, unchanged escitalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentration of the escitalopram metabolite S-DCT in plasma is approximately one-third that of escitalopram. The level of S-DDCT was not detectable in most subjects. In vitro studies show that escitalopram is at least 7 and 27 times more potent than S-DCT and S-DDCT, respectively, in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites of escitalopram do not contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of escitalopram. S-DCT and S-DDCT also have no or very low affinity for serotonergic (5-HT1-7) or other receptors including alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine (D1-5), histamine (H1-3), muscarinic (M1-5), and benzodiazepine receptors. S-DCT and S-DDCT also do not bind to various ion channels including Na+, K+, Cl-, and Ca++ channels. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of escitalopram.</paragraph>

Based on in vitro data, escitalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these cytochromes. While in vivo data to address this question are limited, results from drug interaction studies suggest that escitalopram, at a dose of 20 mg, has no 3A4 inhibitory effect and a modest 2D6 inhibitory effect <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID71">7</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph>Pathologic changes (degeneration/atrophy) were observed in the retinas of albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study with racemic citalopram. There was an increase in both incidence and severity of retinal pathology in both male and female rats receiving 80 mg/kg/day. Similar findings were not present in rats receiving 24 mg/kg/day of racemic citalopram for two years, in mice receiving up to 240 mg/kg/day of racemic citalopram for 18 months, or in dogs receiving up to 20 mg/kg/day of racemic citalopram for one year. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Additional studies to investigate the mechanism for this pathology have not been performed, and the potential significance of this effect in humans has not been established.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a one-year toxicology study, 5 of 10 beagle dogs receiving oral racemic citalopram doses of 8 mg/kg/day died suddenly between weeks 17 and 31 following initiation of treatment. Sudden deaths were not observed in rats at doses of racemic citalopram up to 120 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels of citalopram and its metabolites demethylcitalopram and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) similar to those observed in dogs at 8 mg/kg/day. A subsequent intravenous dosing study demonstrated that in beagle dogs, racemic DDCT caused QT prolongation, a known risk factor for the observed outcome in dogs.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of escitalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in three, 8-week, placebo-controlled studies conducted in outpatients between 18 and 65 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder. The primary outcome in all three studies was change from baseline to endpoint in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A fixed-dose study compared 10 mg/day escitalopram and 20 mg/day escitalopram to placebo and 40 mg/day citalopram. The 10 mg/day and 20 mg/day escitalopram treatment groups showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS. The 10 mg and 20 mg escitalopram groups were similar on this outcome measure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a second fixed-dose study of 10 mg/day escitalopram and placebo, the 10 mg/day escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a flexible-dose study, comparing escitalopram, titrated between 10 and 20 mg/day, to placebo and citalopram, titrated between 20 and 40 mg/day, the escitalopram treatment group showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the MADRS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Analyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a longer-term trial, 274 patients meeting (DSM-IV) criteria for major depressive disorder, who had responded during an initial 8-week, open-label treatment phase with escitalopram 10 or 20 mg/day, were randomized to continuation of escitalopram at their same dose, or to placebo, for up to 36 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open-label phase was defined by having a decrease of the MADRS total score to ≤ 12. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of the MADRS total score to ≥ 22, or discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response. Patients receiving continued escitalopram experienced a statistically significant longer time to relapse compared to those receiving placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of escitalopram tablets as a treatment for major depressive disorder in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years was established in an 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study that compared escitalopram tablets (10 mg to 20 mg daily) to placebo in outpatients 12 to 17 years of age inclusive who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The primary outcome was change from baseline to endpoint in the Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R). In this study, escitalopram tablets showed statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the CDRS-R.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of escitalopram tablets in the treatment of major depressive disorder in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the 8-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study with racemic citalopram 20 mg to 40 mg daily. In this outpatient study in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder, citalopram treatment showed statistically significant greater mean improvement from baseline, compared to placebo, on the CDRS-R; the positive results for this trial largely came from the 12 to 17 year subgroup.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two additional flexible-dose, placebo-controlled MDD studies (one escitalopram tablets study in patients ages 7 to 17 years and one citalopram study patients 13 to 18 years) did not demonstrate efficacy. The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with MDD.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of escitalopram in the acute treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was demonstrated in three, 8-week, multicenter, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled studies that compared escitalopram 10 to 20 mg/day to placebo in adult outpatients between 18 and 80 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for GAD.
