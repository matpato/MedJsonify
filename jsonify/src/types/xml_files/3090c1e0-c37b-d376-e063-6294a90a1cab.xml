                        <paragraph>Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab products. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see
  
   <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>].
 
  </content>Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystosis were reported with tocilizumab products. Other serious infections, not reported in clinical studies, may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, listeriosis). Patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids which in addition to rheumatoid arthritis may predispose them to infections.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking intravenous tocilizumab products. Some of these cases have resulted in liver transplant or death. Time to onset for cases ranged from months to years after treatment initiation with tocilizumab products. While most cases presented with marked elevations of transaminases (&gt; 5 times ULN), some cases presented with signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction and only mildly elevated transaminases.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During randomized controlled studies, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations

  </content>Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with tocilizumab.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For RA and GCA patients, obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) before initiating TOFIDENCE, every 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy for the first 6 months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. It is not recommended to initiate TOFIDENCE treatment in RA or GCA patients with elevated transaminases ALT or AST greater than 1.5Ã— ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT or AST greater than 5Ã— ULN, discontinue TOFIDENCE. For recommended modifications based upon increase in transaminases

                        <paragraph>Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may have elevated ALT or AST levels. Multi-organ failure with involvement of the liver is recognized as a complication of severe COVID-19. The decision to administer TOFIDENCE should balance the potential benefit of treating COVID-19 against the potential risks of acute treatment with TOFIDENCE. It is not recommended to initiate TOFIDENCE treatment in COVID-19 patients with elevated ALT or AST above 10 Ã— ULN. Monitor ALT and AST during treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, such as fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (e.g., ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, serum total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range), TOFIDENCE treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. TOFIDENCE should only be restarted in patients with another explanation for the liver test abnormalities after normalization of the liver tests.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A similar pattern of liver enzyme elevation is noted with tocilizumab products treatment in the PJIA and SJIA populations. Monitor liver test panel at the time of the second administration and thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks for PJIA and every 2 to 4 weeks for SJIA.</paragraph>

  </content>The most commonly reported adverse reactions in controlled studies up to 24 weeks (occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with tocilizumab-IV monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was 5% for patients taking tocilizumab-IV and 3% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that required discontinuation of tocilizumab-IV were increased hepatic transaminase values (per protocol requirement) and serious infections.</paragraph>

Reports of gastrointestinal perforation were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis including generalized purulent peritonitis, lower GI perforation, fistula and abscess. Most patients who developed gastrointestinal perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate

                        <paragraph>The safety of tocilizumab-IV was studied in an open label PK-PD and safety study in 24 patients with GCA who were in remission on tocilizumab-IV at time of enrollment. Patients received tocilizumab 7 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 20 weeks, followed by 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. The total patient years exposure to treatment was 17.5 years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of tocilizumab by another route of administration has been studied in one Phase III study with 251 GCA patients. The total patient years duration was 138.5 patient years during the 12-month double blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. The overall safety profile observed was generally consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab. There was an overall higher incidence of infections in GCA patients relative to RA patients.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety of tocilizumab-IV was studied in 188 pediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age with PJIA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to methotrexate. The total patient exposure in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population (defined as patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab-IV) was 184.4 patient years. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking oral corticosteroids and almost 80% were taking methotrexate. In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with PJIA were consistent with those seen in RA and SJIA patients

                              <paragraph>In PJIA patients, infusion-related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, 11 patients (6%) experienced an event during the infusion, and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an infusion. The most common events occurring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension, and occurring within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and SJIA patients

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The data described below reflect exposure to tocilizumab-IV in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 112 pediatric patients with SJIA 2 to 17 years of age who had an inadequate clinical response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking 0.3 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or more, and almost 70% were taking methotrexate. The trial included a 12 week controlled phase followed by an open-label extension. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled portion of the clinical study 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab-IV (8 or 12 mg per kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab-IV in the open-label extension phase.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse events (at least 5%) seen in tocilizumab-IV treated patients in the 12 week controlled portion of the study were: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In the 12 week controlled study, no patient in any treatment group experienced macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) while on assigned treatment; 3 per 112 (3%) developed MAS during open-label treatment with tocilizumab-IV. One patient in the placebo group escaped to tocilizumab-IV 12 mg per kg at Week 2 due to severe disease activity, and ultimately developed MAS at Day 70. Two additional patients developed MAS during the long-term extension. All 3 patients had tocilizumab-IV dose interrupted (2 patients) or discontinued (1 patient) for the MAS event, received treatment, and the MAS resolved without sequelae. Based on a limited number of cases, the incidence of MAS does not appear to be elevated in the tocilizumab-IV SJIA clinical development experience; however no definitive conclusions can be made.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was evaluated in a pooled safety population that includes patients enrolled in EMPACTA, COVACTA, AND REMDACTA. The analysis of adverse reactions included a total of 974 patients exposed to tocilizumab. Patients received a single, 60-minute infusion of intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800 mg). If clinical signs or symptoms worsened or did not improve, one additional dose of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg could be administered between 8- 24 hours after the initial dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions summarized in Table 3 occurred in at least 3% of tocilizumab -treated patients and more commonly than in patients on placebo in the pooled safety population.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cytochrome P450s in the liver are down-regulated by infection and inflammation stimuli including cytokines such as IL-6. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling in RA patients treated with tocilizumab products may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels than those in the absence of tocilizumab products leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. In vitro studies showed that tocilizumab has the potential to affect expression of multiple CYP enzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Its effect on CYP2C8 or transporters is unknown. In vivo studies with omeprazole, metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and simvastatin, metabolized by CYP3A4, showed up to a 28% and 57% decrease in exposure one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, respectively. The effect of tocilizumab products on CYP enzymes may be clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of TOFIDENCE, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, perform therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as needed. Exercise caution when coadministering TOFIDENCE with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, lovastatin, atorvastatin, etc. The effect of tocilizumab products on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy

                              <paragraph>The available data with tocilizumab products from a pregnancy exposure registry, retrospective cohort study, pharmacovigilance, and published literature are insufficient to draw conclusion about a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. These studies had methodological limitations, including small sample size of tocilizumab exposed groups, missing exposure and outcomes information, and lack of adjustment for cofounders. Monoclonal antibodies, such as tocilizumab products, are actively transported across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the

  <sup>-/-</sup>null mice), parturition was delayed relative to wild-type (ll6
 
  <sup>+/+</sup>) mice. Administration of recombinant IL-6 to ll6
 
  <sup>-/-</sup>null mice restored the normal timing of delivery.

Concurrent use of stable background treatment with corticosteroids, MTX, and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was permitted. Patients who completed the 12-week period could continue to the optional extension period (a total of 52-weeks or until the age of 2 years, whichever was longer).</paragraph>

SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and infectious AEs were reported by 27.3%, 36.4%, and 81.8% of patients. Six patients (54.5%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions, defined as all adverse events occurring during or within 24 hours after an infusion considered related to tocilizumab. Three of these patients experienced serious hypersensitivity reactions and were withdrawn from the study. Three patients with hypersensitivity reactions (two with serious hypersensitivity reactions) developed treatment induced anti-tocilizumab antibodies after the event. There were no cases of MAS based on the protocol-specified criteria, but 2 cases of suspected MAS based on Ravelli criteria

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Tocilizumab products bind to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and have been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In clinical studies in RA patients with the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg intravenous doses decreases in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2. Changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were observed (i.e., decreases in rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A, fibrinogen and increases in hemoglobin) with doses, however the greatest improvements were observed with 8 mg per kg tocilizumab. Pharmacodynamic changes were also observed to occur after tocilizumab administration in GCA, PJIA, and SJIA patients (decreases in CRP, ESR, and increases in hemoglobin). The relationship between these pharmacodynamic findings and clinical efficacy is not known.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy subjects administered tocilizumab in doses from 2 to 28 mg per kg intravenously, absolute neutrophil counts decreased to the nadir 3 to 5 days following tocilizumab administration. Thereafter, neutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner. Rheumatoid arthritis and GCA patients demonstrated a similar pattern of absolute neutrophil counts following tocilizumab administration

                        <paragraph>PK of tocilizumab is characterized by nonlinear elimination which is a combination of linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten elimination. The nonlinear part of tocilizumab elimination leads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional. The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab do not change with time. Due to the dependence of total clearance on tocilizumab serum concentrations, the half-life of tocilizumab is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on the serum concentration level. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so far indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and RA patients suggest that PK is similar between the two populations.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The population PK model was developed from an analysis dataset composed of an IV dataset of 1793 patients from Study I, Study III, Study IV, and Study V. C
 
  <sub>mean</sub>is included in place of AUC
 
  <sub>tau</sub>, since for dosing regimens with different inter-dose intervals, the mean concentration over the dosing period characterizes the comparative exposure better than AUC
 
  <sub>tau</sub>.

 </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>At high serum concentrations, when total clearance of tocilizumab is dominated by linear clearance, a terminal half-life of approximately 21.5 days was derived from the population parameter estimates.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For doses of 4 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C
 
  <sub>max</sub>, C
 
  <sub>trough</sub>, and C
 
  <sub>mean</sub>of tocilizumab at steady state were 86.1 (44.8â€“202) mcg/mL, 0.1 (0.0â€“14.6) mcg/mL, and 18.0 (8.9â€“50.7) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C
 
  <sub>max</sub>, C
 
  <sub>trough</sub>, and C
 
  <sub>mean</sub>of tocilizumab were 176 (75.4â€“557) mcg/mL, 13.4 (0.1â€“154) mcg/mL, and 54.0 (17â€“260) mcg/mL, respectively. C
 
  <sub>max</sub>increased dose-proportionally between doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks, while a greater than dose-proportional increase was observed in C
 
  <sub>mean</sub>and C
 
  <sub>trough</sub>. At steady-state, C
 
  <sub>mean</sub>and C
 
  <sub>trough</sub>were 3.0 and 134 fold higher at 8 mg/kg as compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively.

 </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The accumulation ratios for AUC and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>after multiple doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W are low, while the accumulation ratios for C
 
  <sub>trough</sub>are higher (2.62 and 2.47, respectively). For C
 
  <sub>max</sub>, greater than 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 1st IV infusion. For AUC
 
  <sub>tau</sub>and C
 
  <sub>mean</sub>, 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 1st and 3rd infusion for 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg IV, while for C
 
  <sub>trough</sub>, approximately 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 4th IV infusion after both doses.

 </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Population PK analysis identified body weight as a significant covariate impacting the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. When given IV on a mg/kg basis, individuals with body weight â‰¥ 100 kg are predicted to have mean steady-state exposures higher than mean values for the patient population. Therefore, tocilizumab doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in patients with RA

                                    <paragraph>Tocilizumab is eliminated by a combination of linear clearance and nonlinear elimination. The concentration-dependent nonlinear elimination plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the nonlinear pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance. The saturation of the nonlinear elimination leads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional. The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab do not change with time.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so far indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The linear clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was estimated to be 12.5 mL per h in RA patients, 6.7 mL per h in GCA patients, 5.8 mL per h in pediatric patients with PJIA, and 5.7 mL per h in pediatric patients with SJIA. In COVID-19 patients, serum concentrations were below the limit of quantification after 35 days on average following one infusion of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously. The average linear clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was estimated to be 17.6 mL per hour in patients with baseline ordinal scale category 3 (OS 3, patients requiring supplemental oxygen), 22.5 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 4 (patients requiring high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation), 29 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 5 (patients requiring mechanical ventilation), and 35.4 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 6 (patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or mechanical ventilation and additional organ support).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Due to the dependence of total clearance on tocilizumab serum concentrations, the half-life of tocilizumab is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on the serum concentration level.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>For intravenous administration in RA patients, the concentration-dependent apparent t
 
  <sub>1/2</sub>is up to 11 days for 4 mg per kg and up to 13 days for 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks in patients with RA at steady-state.

 </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>For intravenous administration in GCA patients, the TCZ concentration-dependent apparent t
 
  <sub>1/2</sub>was 13.2 days following 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks.

 </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The t
 
  <sub>1/2</sub>of tocilizumab in children with PJIA is up to 17 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight at or above 30 kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight below 30 kg) during a dosing interval at steady state.

 </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The t
 
  <sub>1/2</sub>of tocilizumab intravenous in pediatric patients with SJIA is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight at or above 30 kg and 12 mg/kg for body weight below 30 kg every other week) during a dosing interval at steady-state.

                                    <paragraph>Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients and GCA patients showed that age, gender and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. Linear clearance was found to increase with body size. In RA patients, the body weight-based dose (8 mg per kg) resulted in approximately 86% higher exposure in patients who are greater than 100 kg in comparison to patients who are less than 60 kg.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In COVID-19 patients, exposure following body-weight-based intravenous dosing (8 mg per kg tocilizumab up to 100 kg body weight with a maximum dose of 800 mg) was dependent on body weight and disease severity assessed by an ordinal scale (OS). Within an OS category, compared to patients with a mean body weight of 80 kg, exposure was 20% lower in patients weighing less than 60 kg. Exposure in patients weighing more than 100 kg was in the same range as exposure in patients with a mean body weight of 80 kg. For an 80 kg patient, exposure decreases as OS category increases; for each category increase, exposure decreases by 13%.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>In vitro data suggested that IL-6 reduced mRNA expression for several CYP450 isoenzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and this reduced expression was reversed by co-incubation with tocilizumab at clinically relevant concentrations. Accordingly, inhibition of IL-6 signaling in RA patients treated with tocilizumab may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels than those in the absence of tocilizumab leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. Its effect on CYP2C8 or transporters (e.g., P-gp) is unknown. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation of TOFIDENCE , in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as needed. Caution should be exercised when TOFIDENCE is coadministered with drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives (CYP3A4 substrates)

In 12 RA patients not treated with tocilizumab, receiving 40 mg simvastatin, exposures of simvastatin and its metabolite, simvastatin acid, was 4- to 10-fold and 2-fold higher, respectively, than the exposures observed in healthy subjects. One week following administration of a single infusion of tocilizumab (10 mg per kg), exposure of simvastatin and simvastatin acid decreased by 57% and 39%, respectively, to exposures that were similar or slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects. Exposures of simvastatin and simvastatin acid increased upon withdrawal of tocilizumab in RA patients. Selection of a particular dose of simvastatin in RA patients should take into account the potentially lower exposures that may result after initiation of TOFIDENCE, (due to normalization of CYP3A4) or higher exposures after discontinuation of TOFIDENCE.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenicity potential of tocilizumab products. Literature indicates that the IL-6 pathway can mediate anti-tumor responses by promoting increased immune cell surveillance of the tumor microenvironment. However, available published evidence also supports that IL-6 signaling through the IL-6 receptor may be involved in pathways that lead to tumorigenesis. The malignancy risk in humans from an antibody that disrupts signaling through the IL-6 receptor, such as tocilizumab, is presently unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male and female mice that received a murine analogue of tocilizumab administered by the intravenous route at a dose of 50 mg/kg every three days.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of intravenously administered tocilizumab was assessed in five randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies in patients greater than 18 years with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline. Tocilizumab was given intravenously every 4 weeks as monotherapy (Study I), in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (Studies II and III) or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study IV) in patients with an inadequate response to those drugs, or in combination with MTX in patients with an inadequate response to TNF antagonists (Study V).</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Study I</content>(NCT00109408) evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had not been treated with MTX within 24 weeks prior to randomization, or who had not discontinued previous methotrexate treatment as a result of clinically important toxic effects or lack of response. In this study, 67% of patients were MTX-naÃ¯ve, and over 40% of patients had rheumatoid arthritis less than 2 years. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy or MTX alone (dose titrated over 8 weeks from 7.5 mg to a maximum of 20 mg weekly). The primary endpoint was the proportion of tocilizumab patients who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24.

                           <content styleCode="italics">Study II</content>(NCT00106535) was a 104-week study with an optional 156-week extension phase that evaluated patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients received tocilizumab 8 mg per kg, tocilizumab 4 mg per kg, or placebo every four weeks, in combination with MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly). Upon completion of 52-weeks, patients received open-label treatment with tocilizumab 8 mg per kg through 104 weeks or they had the option to continue their double-blind treatment if they maintained a greater than 70% improvement in swollen/tender joint count. Two pre-specified interim analyses at week 24 and week 52 were conducted. The primary endpoint at week 24 was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR 20 response. At weeks 52 and 104, the primary endpoints were change from baseline in modified total Sharp-Genant score and the area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score.

                              <paragraph>In Study II, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in total Sharp-Genant score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. Radiographs of hands/wrists and forefeet were obtained at baseline, 24 weeks, 52 weeks, and 104 weeks and scored by readers unaware of treatments group and visit number. The results from baseline to week 52 are shown in Table 7. tocilizumab 4 mg per kg slowed (less than 75% inhibition compared to the control group) and tocilizumab 8 mg per kg inhibited (at least 75% inhibition compared to the control group) the progression of structural damage compared to placebo plus MTX at week 52.</paragraph>

This CV safety study was designed to exclude a moderate increase in CV risk in patients treated with tocilizumab compared with a TNF inhibitor standard of care (etanercept).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The study included 3,080 seropositive RA patients with active disease and an inadequate response to non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, who were aged â‰¥50 years with at least one additional CV risk factor beyond RA. Patients were randomized 1:1 to IV tocilizumab 8 mg/kg Q4W or SC etanercept 50 mg QW and followed for an average of 3.2 years. The primary endpoint was the comparison of the time-to-first occurrence of any component of a composite of major adverse CV events (MACE; non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or CV death), with the final intent-to-treat analysis based on a total of 161 confirmed CV events (83/1538 [5.4%] for tocilizumab; 78/1542 [5.1%] for etanercept) reviewed by an independent and blinded adjudication committee.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Non-inferiority of tocilizumab to etanercept for cardiovascular risk was determined by excluding &gt;80% relative increase in the risk of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of MACE comparing tocilizumab to etanercept was 1.05; 95% CI (0.77, 1.43).</paragraph>

                     <title>14.3 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritisâ€”Intravenous Administration</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of tocilizumab was assessed in a three-part study, WA19977 (NCT00988221), including an open-label extension in children 2 to 17 years of age with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA), who had an inadequate response to methotrexate or inability to tolerate methotrexate. Patients had at least 6 months of active disease (mean disease duration of 4.2 Â± 3.7 years), with at least five joints with active arthritis (swollen or limitation of movement accompanied by pain and/or tenderness) and/or at least 3 active joints having limitation of motion (mean, 20 Â± 14 active joints). The patients treated had subtypes of JIA that at disease onset included Rheumatoid Factor Positive or Negative Polyarticular JIA, or Extended Oligoarticular JIA. Treatment with a stable dose of methotrexate was permitted but was not required during the study. Concurrent use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), other than methotrexate, or other biologics (e.g., TNF antagonists or T cell costimulation modulator) were not permitted in the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Part I consisted of a 16-week active tocilizumab treatment lead-in period (n=188) followed by Part II, a 24-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal period, followed by Part III, a 64-week open-label period. Eligible patients weighing at or above 30 kg received tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg intravenously once every four weeks. Patients weighing less than 30 kg were randomized 1:1 to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intravenously every four weeks. At the conclusion of the open-label Part I, 91% of patients taking background MTX in addition to tocilizumab and 83% of patients on tocilizumab monotherapy achieved an ACR 30 response at week 16 compared to baseline and entered the blinded withdrawal period (Part II) of the study. The proportions of patients with JIA ACR 50/70 responses in Part I were 84.0%, and 64%, respectively for patients taking background MTX in addition to tocilizumab and 80% and 55% respectively for patients on tocilizumab monotherapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Part II, patients (ITT, n=163) were randomized to tocilizumab (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio that was stratified by concurrent methotrexate use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in Part II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR 30 flare criteria (relative to Week 16) and qualified for escape.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR 30 flare at week 40 relative to week 16. JIA ACR 30 flare was defined as 3 or more of the 6 core outcome variables worsening by at least 30% with no more than 1 of the remaining variables improving by more than 30% relative to Week 16.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tocilizumab treated patients experienced significantly fewer disease flares compared to placebo-treated patients (26% [21/82] versus 48% [39/81]; adjusted difference in proportions -21%, 95% CI: -35%, -8%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the withdrawal phase (Part II), more patients treated with tocilizumab showed JIA ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 40 compared to patients withdrawn to placebo.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of active SJIA was assessed in WA18221 (NCT00642460), a 12-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 2-arm study. Patients treated with or without MTX, were randomized (tocilizumab:placebo = 2:1) to one of two treatment groups: 75 patients received tocilizumab infusions every two weeks at either 8 mg per kg for patients at or above 30 kg or 12 mg per kg for patients less than 30 kg and 37 were randomized to receive placebo infusions every two weeks. Corticosteroid tapering could occur from week six for patients who achieved a JIA ACR 70 response. After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab in the open-label extension phase at weight appropriate dosing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 30% improvement in JIA ACR core set (JIA ACR 30 response) at Week 12 and absence of fever (no temperature at or above 37.5Â°C in the preceding 7 days). JIA ACR (American College of Rheumatology) responses are defined as the percentage improvement (e.g., 30%, 50%, 70%) in 3 of any 6 core outcome variables compared to baseline, with worsening in no more than 1 of the remaining variables by 30% or more. Core outcome variables consist of physician global assessment, parent per patient global assessment, number of joints with active arthritis, number of joints with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and functional ability (childhood health assessment questionnaire-CHAQ).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Primary endpoint result and JIA ACR response rates at Week 12 are shown in Table 8.</paragraph>

Seventeen (24%) tocilizumab patients versus 1 (3%) placebo patient were able to reduce the dose of corticosteroid by at least 20% without experiencing a subsequent JIA ACR 30 flare or occurrence of systemic symptoms to week 12. In the open label portion of the study, by week 44, there were 44 out of 103 (43%) tocilizumab patients off oral corticosteroids. Of these 44 patients 50% were off corticosteroids 18 weeks or more.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>RECOVERY was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter platform study conducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients for the tocilizumab portion of the study had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical contraindications to any of the treatments and had clinical evidence of progressive COVID-19 (defined as oxygen saturation &lt;92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, and CRP â‰¥75 mg/L). Patients were then randomized to receive either standard of care (SoC) or intravenous tocilizumab at a weight-tiered dosing comparable to the recommended dosage

                              <paragraph>Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprising 4116 adult patients who were randomized to the tocilizumab + SoC arm (n=2022) or to the SoC arm (n=2094). The mean age of participants was 64 years (range: 20 to 101), and patients were 67% male, 76% White, 11% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% mixed race. At baseline, 0.2% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% of patients required low flow oxygen, 41% of patients required non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, and 14% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation; 82% of patients were reported to be receiving systemic corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was time to death through Day 28. The results for the overall population and the subgroups of patients who were or were not receiving systemic corticosteroids at time of randomization are summarized in Table 9.</paragraph>

At baseline, 9% patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 64% patients required low flow oxygen, 27% patients required high-flow oxygen, and 73% were on corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint evaluated time to progression to mechanical ventilation or death through Day 28. The hazard ratio comparing tocilizumab to placebo was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97), a statistically significant result (log-rank, p-value = 0.036). The cumulative proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation or died by Day 28 was 12.0% (95% CI, 8.5% to 16.9%) in the tocilizumab arm and 19.3% (95% CI, 13.3% to 27.4%) in the placebo arm.</paragraph>

The study randomized 452 patients who were at least 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by a positive RT-PCR result, had pneumonia confirmed by radiography, and had oxygen saturation of 93% or lower on ambient air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mmHg or less. At baseline, 3% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 28% were on low flow oxygen, 30% were on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, 38% were on invasive mechanical ventilation, and 22% were on corticosteroids. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical status on Day 28 assessed on a 7-category ordinal scale that ranged from "discharged" to "death." There were no statistically significant differences observed in the distributions of clinical status on the 7-category ordinal scale at Day 28 when comparing the tocilizumab arm to the placebo arm.</paragraph>

At baseline, 7% of patients were on low flow oxygen, 80% were on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, 14% were on invasive mechanical ventilation, and 84% were on corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was time from randomization to hospital discharge or 'ready for discharge' up to Day 28. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms with respect to time to hospital discharge or "ready for discharge" through Day 28.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Mortality at Day 28 was 18.1% in the tocilizumab + RDV arm versus 19.5% in the placebo +RDV arm (weighted difference (tocilizumab arm - placebo arm): -1.3% [95% CI, -7.8% to 5.2%]).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>A study-level meta-analysis was conducted on EMPACTA, COVACTA, REMDACTA and RECOVERY studies. For each of the four studies, the risk difference through Day 28 was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method in the subgroup of patients receiving baseline corticosteroids, summarized in Figure 2. Patients from the RECOVERY trial represent 78.8% of the total sample size in this meta-analysis. The combined risk difference showed that tocilizumab treatment (n=2261) resulted in a 4.61% absolute reduction in the risk of death at Day 28 (risk difference=-4.6%; 95% CI: -7.3% to -1.9%) compared to SoC (n=2034).</paragraph>
