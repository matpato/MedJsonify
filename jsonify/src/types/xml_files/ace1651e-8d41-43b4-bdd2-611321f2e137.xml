                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Disposition of metronidazole in the body is similar for both oral and intravenous dosage forms. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole capsules 375 mg have been shown to have a rate and extent of absorption similar to metronidazole tablets and were bioequivalent at an equal single dose of 750 mg. In a study conducted with 23 adult, healthy, female volunteers, oral administration of two 375 mg metronidazole capsules under fasted conditions produced a mean (±1 SD) peak plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of 21.4 (±2.8) mcg/mL with a mean T<sub>max</sub> of 1.6 (± 0.7) hours and a mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of 223 (±44) mcg·hr/mL. In the same study, three 250 mg metronidazole tablets produced a mean C<sub>max</sub> of 20.4 (± 3.8) mcg/mL with a mean T<sub>max</sub> of 1.4 (± 0.4) hours and a mean AUC of 218 (± 50) mcg·hr/mL. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Administration of metronidazole capsules 375 mg with food does not affect the extent of absorption of metronidazole; however, the presence of food results in a lower C<sub>max</sub> and a delayed T<sub>max</sub> compared to fasted conditions. In a study of 14 healthy, adult, female volunteers, administration of metronidazole capsules 375 mg under fasting conditions produced a mean C<sub>max</sub> of 10.9 (± 1.5) mcg/mL, a mean T<sub>max</sub> of 1.5 (± 1.4) hours, and a mean AUC of 110 (± 34) mcg·hr/mL compared to a mean C<sub>max</sub> of 8.6 (± 1.6) mcg/mL, a mean T<sub>max</sub> of 4.2 (± 1.7) hours, and a mean AUC of 99 (± 14) mcg·hr/mL under fed conditions. </paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Distribution </content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole is the major component appearing in the plasma, with lesser quantities of metabolites also being present. Less than 20% of the circulating metronidazole is bound to plasma proteins. Metronidazole appears in cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and breast milk in concentrations similar to those found in plasma. Bactericidal concentrations of metronidazole have also been detected in pus from hepatic abscesses. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Metabolism/Excretion </content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The major route of elimination of metronidazole and its metabolites is via the urine (60% to 80% of the dose), with fecal excretion accounting for 6% to 15% of the dose. The metabolites that appear in the urine result primarily from side-chain oxidation [1-(ß-hydroxyethyl)-2-hydroxymethyl-5-nitroimidazole and 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole-1-yl-acetic acid] and glucuronide conjugation, with unchanged metronidazole accounting for approximately 20% of the total. Both the parent compound and the hydroxyl metabolite possess <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>antimicrobial activity against most strains of anaerobic bacteria and <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>trichomonacidal activity. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Renal clearance of metronidazole is approximately 10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The average elimination half-life of metronidazole in healthy subjects is eight hours. </paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Renal Impairment </content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Decreased renal function does not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of metronidazole. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD; CL<sub>CR</sub>=8.1±9.1 mL/min) and who received a single intravenous infusion of metronidazole 500 mg had no significant change in metronidazole pharmacokinetics but had 2-fold higher C<sub>max</sub> of hydroxy-metronidazole and 5-fold higher C<sub>max</sub> of metronidazole acetate, compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function (CL<sub>CR</sub>=126±16 mL/min). Thus, on account of the potential accumulation of metronidazole metabolites in ESRD patients, monitoring for metronidazole associated adverse events is recommended (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Effect of Dialysis </content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following a single intravenous infusion or oral dose of metronidazole 500 mg, the clearance of metronidazole was investigated in ESRD subjects undergoing hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A hemodialysis session lasting for 4 to 8 hours removed 40% to 65% of the administered metronidazole dose, depending on the type of dialyzer membrane used and the duration of the dialysis session. If the administration of metronidazole cannot be separated from the dialysis session, supplementation of metronidazole dose following hemodialysis should be considered (see <content styleCode="bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</content>). A peritoneal dialysis session lasting for 7.5 hours removed approximately 10% of the administered metronidazole dose. No adjustment in metronidazole dose is needed in ESRD patients undergoing CAPD. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Hepatic Impairment </content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following a single intravenous infusion of 500 mg metronidazole, the mean AUC<sub>24</sub> of metronidazole was higher by 114% in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, and by 54% and 53% in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) and moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy control subjects. There were no significant changes in the AUC<sub>24 </sub>of hydroxy-metronidazole in these hepatically impaired patients. Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicates the metronidazole dosage in amebiasis should be reduced by 50% and the dosage interval for trichomoniasis should be increased from every 12 hours to every 24 hours in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is needed for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with hepatic impairment should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS </content>and <content styleCode="bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</content>). </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following a single 500 mg oral or IV dose of metronidazole, subjects &gt;70 years old with no apparent renal or hepatic dysfunction had a 40% to 80% higher mean AUC of hydroxy-metronidazole (active metabolite), with no apparent increase in the mean AUC of metronidazole (parent compound), compared to young healthy controls &lt;40 years old. In geriatric patients, monitoring for metronidazole associated adverse events is recommended (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS</content>). </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In one study, newborn infants appeared to demonstrate diminished capacity to eliminate metronidazole. The elimination half-life, measured during the first 3 days of life, was inversely related to gestational age. In infants whose gestational ages were between 28 and 40 weeks, the corresponding elimination half-lives ranged from 109 to 22.5 hours. </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole, exerts antibacterial effects in an anaerobic environment against most obligate anaerobes. Once metronidazole enters the organism by passive diffusion and activated in the cytoplasm of susceptible anaerobic bacteria, it is reduced; this process includes intra-cellular electron transport proteins such as ferredoxin, transfer of an electron to the nitro group of the metronidazole, and formation of a short-lived nitroso free radical. Because of this alteration of the metronidazole molecule, a concentration gradient is created and maintained which promotes the drug’s intracellular transport. The reduced form of metronidazole and free radicals can interact with DNA leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and DNA degradation leading to death of the bacteria.

Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole in cases of reinfection. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Patients should be counseled that metronidazole capsules 375 mg should only be used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When metronidazole capsules 375 mg is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by metronidazole capsules 375 mg in the future. </paragraph>

Values of zero may be observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+ </sup> <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM2"/>NADH).

However, rats treated at the same dose for 6 weeks or longer were infertile and showed severe degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium in the testes as well as marked decreases in testicular spermatid counts and epididymal sperm counts.

                  <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of metronidazole capsules 375 mg in pregnant women. There are published data from case-control studies, cohort studies, and 2-meta-analyses that include more than 5000 pregnant women who used metronidazole during pregnancy. Many studies included first trimester exposures. One study showed an increased risk of cleft lip, with or without cleft palate, in infants exposed to metronidazole <content styleCode="italics">in-utero</content>; however, these finding were not confirmed. In addition, more than ten randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials enrolled more than 5000 pregnant women to assess the use of antibiotic treatment (including metronidazole) for bacterial vaginosis on the incidence of preterm delivery. Most studies did not show an increased risk for congenital abnormalities or other adverse fetal outcomes following metronidazole exposure during pregnancy. Three studies conducted to assess the risk of infant cancer following metronidazole exposure during pregnancy did not show an increased risk; however, the ability of these studies to detect such a signal was limited.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Metronidazole is present in human milk at concentrations similar to maternal serum levels, and infant serum levels can be close to or comparable to infant therapeutic levels. There are no data on the effects of metronidazole on milk production. Animal studies have shown the potential for tumorigenicity after oral metronidazole was administered chronically to rats and mice (see <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS</content>, <content styleCode="bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</content>). This drug is not intended to be administered chronically; therefore, the clinical relevance of the findings of the animal studies is unclear. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for metronidazole and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metronidazole or from the underlying maternal condition. Alternatively, a nursing mother may choose to pump and discard human milk for the duration of metronidazole therapy, and for 48 hours after the last dose and feed her infant stored human milk or formula.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>For amebiasis patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicate that the metronidazole capsules 375 mg dose should be reduced by 50%. Therefore, the dosage regimen of metronidazole capsules 375 mg in Child Pugh C patients with amebiasis is 375 mg q8h for 5 to 10 days (see <content styleCode="bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </content>and <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS</content>). </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>For trichomoniasis patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicate that the frequency of metronidazole administration should be reduced from every 12 hours to every 24 hours. Therefore, the dosage regiment of metronidazole capsules 375 mg in Child Pugh C patients with trichomoniasis is 375 mg q24h for 7 days (see <content styleCode="bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY </content>and <content styleCode="bold">PRECAUTIONS</content>). </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Hemodialysis removes significant amounts of metronidazole and its metabolites from systemic circulation. The clearance of metronidazole will depend on the type of dialysis membrane used, the duration of the dialysis session, and other factors. If the administration of metronidazole cannot be separated from a hemodialysis session, supplementation of metronidazole dosage following the hemodialysis session should be considered, depending on the patient’s clinical situation (see <content styleCode="bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</content>). </paragraph>
