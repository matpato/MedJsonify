For mild-to-moderate AD and PDD patients, continue the effective dose of 9.5 mg/24 hours for as long as therapeutic benefit persists.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Rivastigmine transdermal system can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss. Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes. The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose-related <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. For this reason, initiate treatment with Rivastigmine Transdermal System at a dose of 4.6 mg/24 hours and titrate to a dose of 9.5 mg/24 hours and then to a dose of 13.3 mg/24 hours, if appropriate <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.1">Dosage and Administration (2.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If treatment is interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, reinitiate Rivastigmine Transdermal System with the 4.6 mg/24 hours dose to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae. A postmarketing report described a case of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment of an oral formulation of rivastigmine without retitration after 8 weeks of treatment interruption.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inform caregivers to monitor for gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to inform the physician if they occur. It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application site reactions spread beyond the patch size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g. increasing erythema, edema, papules, vesicles) and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal. In these cases, treatment should be discontinued <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients who develop application site reactions to Rivastigmine Transdermal System suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis and who still require rivastigmine, treatment should be switched to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision. It is possible that some patients sensitized to rivastigmine by exposure to Rivastigmine Transdermal System may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There have been isolated postmarketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated allergic dermatitis when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral or transdermal). In these cases, treatment should be discontinued <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]</content>. Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly.</paragraph>

Monitor patients using Rivastigmine Transdermal System for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of rivastigmine have shown no significant increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.</paragraph>

The percentage of patients with these events was higher in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/24 hours group than in the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours group. Patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased appetite experienced these reactions more often during the first 4 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase. These reactions decreased over time in each treatment group. Weight decreased was reported to have increased over time in each treatment group.</paragraph>

Overall, the majority of patients in this study experienced adverse reactions that were mild (30.7%) or moderate (32.1%) in severity. Slightly more patients in the 4.6 mg/24 hours patch group reported mild events than in the 13.3 mg/24 hours patch group, while the numbers of patients reporting moderate events were comparable between groups. Severe adverse reactions were reported at a slightly higher percentage at the higher dose (12.4%) than at the lower dose (10%) treatment groups. With the exception of severe adverse reactions of agitation (13.3 mg: 1.1%; 4.6 mg: 1.4%), fall (13.3 mg: 1.1%) and urinary tract infection (4.6 mg: 1.1%), all adverse reactions reported as severe occurred in less than 1% of patients in either treatment group.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Rivastigmine Transdermal System has been administered to 288 patients with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's Disease Dementia in a single, 76-week, open-label, active-comparator safety study. Of these, 256 have been treated for at least 12 weeks, 232 for at least 24 weeks, and 196 for at least 52 weeks.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Treatment with Rivastigmine Transdermal System was initiated at 4.6 mg/24 hours and if tolerated the dose was increased after 4 weeks to 9.5 mg/24 hours. Rivastigmine capsule (target maintenance dose of 12 mg/day) served as the active comparator and was administered to 294 patients. Adverse reactions are presented in Table 5.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Overdose with Rivastigmine Transdermal System has been reported in the postmarketing setting <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. Overdoses have occurred from application of more than one patch at one time and not removing the previous day's patch before applying a new patch. The symptoms reported in these overdose cases are similar to those seen in cases of overdose associated with rivastigmine oral formulations.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a Poison Control Center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug. As rivastigmine has a plasma half-life of about 3.4 hours after patch administration and a duration of acetylcholinesterase inhibition of about 9 hours, it is recommended that in cases of asymptomatic overdose the patch should be immediately removed and no further patch should be applied for the next 24 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>As in any case of overdose, general supportive measures should be utilized.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Overdosage with cholinesterase inhibitors can result in cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea, vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved. Atypical responses in blood pressure and heart rate have been reported with other drugs that increase cholinergic activity when coadministered with quaternary anticholinergics such as glycopyrrolate. Additional symptoms associated with rivastigmine overdose are diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, tremor, headache, somnolence, confusional state, hyperhidrosis, hypertension, hallucinations and malaise. Due to the short plasma elimination half-life of rivastigmine after patch administration, dialysis (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration) would not be clinically indicated in the event of an overdose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In overdose accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting, the use of antiemetics should be considered. A fatal outcome has rarely been reported with rivastigmine overdose.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Rivastigmine Transdermal System contains rivastigmine, a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor known chemically as (S)-3-[1-(dimethylamino) ethyl]phenyl ethylmethylcarbamate. It has an empirical formula of C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>22</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as the base and a molecular weight of 250.34 g/mol (as the base). Rivastigmine is a viscous, clear, and colorless to yellow to very slightly brown liquid that is sparingly soluble in water and very soluble in ethanol, acetonitrile, n-octanol and ethyl acetate. The distribution coefficient at 37°C in n-octanol/phosphate buffer solution pH 7 is 4.27.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Although the precise mechanism of action of rivastigmine is unknown, it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function. This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase. The effect of rivastigmine may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact. There is no evidence that rivastigmine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>After the initial application of rivastigmine transdermal system, there is a lag time of 0.5 to 1 hour in the absorption of rivastigmine. Concentrations then rise slowly typically reaching a maximum after 8 hours, although maximum values (Cmax) can also occur later (at 10 to 16 hours). After the peak, plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24-hour period of application. At steady state, trough levels are approximately 60% to 80% of peak levels.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours gave exposure approximately the same as that provided by an oral dose of 6 mg twice daily (i.e., 12 mg/day). Inter-subject variability in exposure was lower (43% to 49%) for the Rivastigmine Transdermal System formulation as compared with the oral formulations (73% to 103%). Fluctuation (between Cmax and Cmin) is less for Rivastigmine Transdermal System than for the oral formulation of rivastigmine.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Rivastigmine is extensively metabolized primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite NAP226-90. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>, this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (less than 10%). Based on evidence from <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> and animal studies, the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The metabolite-to-parent AUC<sub>∞</sub> ratio was about 0.7 after Rivastigmine Transdermal System application versus 3.5 after oral administration, indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal treatment. Less NAP226-90 is formed following patch application, presumably because of the lack of presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism. Based on <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies, no unique metabolic routes were detected in human skin.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases. Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Based on <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1,CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine taken orally and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers.

                              </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>This study was a randomized double-blind, double dummy clinical investigation in patients with Alzheimer's disease [diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 20] (Study 1). The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 74 years with a range of 50 to 90 years. Approximately 67% of patients were women, and 33% were men. The racial distribution was Caucasian 75%, Black 1%, Asian 9%, and other races 15%.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The effectiveness of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System was evaluated in Study 1 using a dual outcome assessment strategy, evaluating for changes in both cognitive performance and overall clinical effect.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The ability of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), a multi-item instrument that has been extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-Cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance including elements of memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. The ADAS-Cog scoring range is from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. Elderly normal adults may score as low as 0 or 1, but it is not unusual for non-demented adults to score slightly higher.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The ability of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). The ADCS-CGIC is a more standardized form of the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus (CIBIC-Plus) and is also scored as a 7-point categorical rating; scores range from 1, indicating "markedly improved," to 4, indicating "no change," to 7, indicating "marked worsening."</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In Study 1, 1195 patients were randomized to 1 of the following 4 treatments: Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours, Rivastigmine Transdermal System 17.4 mg/24 hours, Rivastigmine Capsules in a dose of 6 mg twice daily, or placebo. This 24-week study was divided into a 16-week titration phase followed by an 8-week maintenance phase.

                              <paragraph>Figure 3 illustrates the time course for the change from baseline in ADAS-Cog scores for all 4 treatment groups over the 24-week study. At 24 weeks, the mean differences in the ADAS-Cog change scores for the rivastigmine-treated patients compared to the patients on placebo, were 1.8, 2.9, and 1.8 units for the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours, Rivastigmine Transdermal System 17.4 mg/24 hours, and Rivastigmine Capsule 6 mg twice daily groups, respectively. The difference between each of these groups and placebo was statistically significant. Although a slight improvement was observed with the 17.4 mg/24 hours patch compared to the 9.5 mg/24 hours patch on this outcome measure, no meaningful difference between the two was seen on the global evaluation (see <linkHtml href="#Fig4">Figure 4</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                              </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>This study was a randomized double-blind clinical investigation in patients with Alzheimer's disease [diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 24] (Study 2). The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 76 years with a range of 50 to 85 years. Approximately 65% of patients were women and 35% were men. The racial distribution was approximately Caucasian 97%, Black 2%, Asian 0.5%, and other races 1%. Approximately 27% of the patients were taking memantine throughout the entire duration of the study.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Alzheimer's disease patients who received 24 to 48 weeks open-label treatment with Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours and who demonstrated functional and cognitive decline were randomized into treatment with either Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours or Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/24 hours in a 48-week, double-blind treatment phase. Functional decline was assessed by the investigator and cognitive decline was defined as a decrease in the MMSE score of greater than or equal to 2 points from the previous visit or a decrease of greater than or equal to 3 points from baseline.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Study 2 was designed to compare the efficacy of Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/ 24 hours versus that of Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours during the 48-week, double-blind treatment phase.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The ability of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/24 hours to improve cognitive performance over that provided by the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours was assessed by the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S14">Clinical Studies (14)</linkHtml>].</content>
                              </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The ability of the Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/24 hours to improve overall function versus that provided by Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours was assessed by the instrumental subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-IADL).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The ADCS-IADL subscale is composed of items 7 to 23 of the caregiver-based ADCS-ADL scale. The ADCS-IADL assesses activities such as those necessary for communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, and conducting hobbies and interests. A sum score is calculated by adding the scores of the individual items and can range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating less impairment.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Out of a total of 1584 patients enrolled in the initial open-label phase of the study, 567 patients were classified as decliners and were randomized into the 48-week double-blind treatment phase of the study. Two hundred eighty-seven (287) patients entered the 9.5 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group and 280 patients entered the 13.3 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Figure 5 illustrates the time course for the mean change from double-blind baseline in ADCS-IADL scores for each treatment group over the course of the 48-week treatment phase of the study. Decline in the mean ADCS-IADL score from the double-blind baseline for the Intent to Treat–Last Observation Carried Forward (ITT-LOCF) analysis was less at each time point in the 13.3 mg/24 hour Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group than in the 9.5 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group. The 13.3 mg/24 hours dose was statistically significantly superior to the 9.5mg/24 hours dose at weeks 16, 24, 32, and 48 (primary endpoint).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Figure 6 illustrates the time course for the mean change from double-blind baseline in ADAS-Cog scores for both treatment groups over the 48-week treatment phase. The between-treatment group difference for Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/24 hours versus Rivastigmine Transdermal System 9.5 mg/24 hours was nominally statistically significant at week 24 (p=0.027), but not at week 48 (p=0.227), which was the primary endpoint.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>This was a 24-week randomized double-blind, clinical investigation in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease [diagnosed by NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 12]. The mean age of patients participating in this trial was 78 years with a range of 51 to 96 years with 62% aged greater than 75 years. Approximately 65% of patients were women and 35% were men. The racial distribution was approximately Caucasian 87%, Black 7%, Asian 1%, and other races 5%. Patients on a stable dose of memantine were permitted to enter the study.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Approximately 61% of the patients in each treatment group were taking memantine throughout the entire duration of the study.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The study was designed to compare the efficacy of Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/ 24 hours versus that of Rivastigmine Transdermal System 4.6 mg/24 hours during the 24-week double-blind treatment phase.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The ability of the 13.3 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System to improve cognitive performance versus that provided by the 4.6 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System was assessed with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) which uses a validated 40-item scale developed for the evaluation of the severity of cognitive dysfunction in more advanced AD patients. The domains assessed included social interaction, memory, language, attention, orientation, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, and orienting to name. The SIB was scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of cognitive ability.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The ability of the 13.3 mg/ 24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System to improve overall function versus that provided by the 4.6 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System was assessed with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living–Severe Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-SIV) which is a caregiver-based ADL scale composed of 19 items developed for use in clinical studies of dementia. It is designed to assess the patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, and making judgments and decisions. A sum score is calculated by adding the scores of the individual items and can range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating less functional impairment.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In this study, 716 patients were randomized into one of the following treatments: Rivastigmine Transdermal System 13.3 mg/24 hours or Rivastigmine Transdermal System 4.6 mg/24 hours in a 1:1 ratio. This 24-week study was divided into an 8-week titration phase followed by a 16-week maintenance phase. In the active treatment arms of this study, temporary dose adjustments below the target dose were permitted during the titration and maintenance phase in the event of poor tolerability.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Figure 7 illustrates the time course for the mean change from baseline SIB scores for each treatment group over the course of the 24-week treatment phase of the study. Decline in the mean SIB score from the baseline for the Modified Full Analysis Set (MFAS)-Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) analysis was less at each timepoint in the 13.3 mg/24 hour Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group than in the 4.6 mg/24 hours Rivastigmine Transdermal System treatment group. The 13.3 mg/24 hours dose was statistically significantly superior to the 4.6 mg/24 hours dose at weeks 16 and 24 (primary endpoint).</paragraph>
