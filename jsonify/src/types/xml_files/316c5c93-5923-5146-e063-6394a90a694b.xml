                  <paragraph>Treatment of medical and surgical infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria: Adults: 1 – 1.5 g/day in 2 or 3 equal doses intravenously.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Children: Intravenous single dose of 20-30 mg/kg/day or 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for children aged 8 weeks to 12 years. Depending on the severity of the infection, the daily dose may be increased to 40 mg/kg. The duration of treatment is usually 7 days.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Children younger than 8 weeks: 15 mg/kg once daily or 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours. Metronidazole accumulation may occur in neonates younger than 40 weeks gestational age during the first week after birth. Therefore, serum metronidazole concentrations may need to be monitored during the first few days of treatment. Once the patient is able to take the medication orally, treatment should be continued with the same oral dose.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Disulfiram: Psychotic reactions have been reported in patients using disulfiram together with metronidazole.
  <br/>
Alcohol: In order to avoid a disulfiram-type reaction (redness in the face and neck area, vomiting, tachycardia), alcoholic beverages or medications containing alcohol should not be consumed during treatment and for at least 2 days after the end of treatment.
  <br/>
Warfarin: Since metronidazole reduces the destruction of oral anticoagulants in the liver, the effect of these preparations and the risk of hemorrhage may increase when used together. Therefore, in combined use, prothrombin levels should be checked frequently and the oral anticoagulant dose to be applied should be adjusted.
  <br/>
Lithium: Plasma levels of lithium may increase when used with metronidazole.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Therefore, plasma concentrations of lithium, creatinine and electrolytes should be monitored in patients receiving metronidazole while on lithium therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Cyclosporine: Increased serum levels of cyclosporine may occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If co-administration with metronidazole is necessary, serum cyclosporine and creatinine levels should be closely monitored.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Phenytoin-phenobarbital: Elimination of metronidazole may be increased and a decrease in serum levels may be observed.
  <br/>
5-fluoro-uracil: When used with metronidazole, the excretion of 5-fluoro-uracil decreases and its toxic effects increase accordingly.
  <br/>
Busulfan: Since metronidazole will increase the plasma busulfan amount, serious busulfan
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>may cause toxicity.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Interference with laboratory tests: Metronidazole may cause changes in AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), LDH, triglycerides, or glucose measurements when measured using the ultraviolet absorbance method.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Mechanism of action</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole is an antibiotic from the 5-nitroimidazole group. It is bactericidal, amoebicidal and trichomonocidal.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Its antimicrobial mechanism of action is not yet known. It is not ionized at physiological pH and is taken into</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>the cells by anaerobic microorganisms and cells. It is reduced to polar metabolites that do not have nitro groups and are not yet fully identified by electron transport proteins with low redox potential in cells. It is thought that reduced metabolites create an antimicrobial effect by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis and damaging DNA. Metronidazole is equally effective on dividing and non-dividing cells. In vitro and in vivo studies have also shown that metronidazole has a direct anti-inflammatory effect by affecting neutrophil motility, lymphocyte formation and cellular immunity.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole is effective against many bacteria in vitro : Bacteroides fragilis, B. bivius (Prevotella bivia), B. disiens (Prevotella disiens), B. distasoni, B. gingivalis, (Porphyromonas gingivalis), B. intermedius (Prevotella intermedia),</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>B. melaninogenicus (Prevotella meloninogenica), B. oralis (Prevotella). oralis), B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. asaccharolyticus (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica), B. ureolyticus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Some species of Mobiluncus (motile, anaerobic and those with coiled rods) are inhibited by metronidazole in vitro , while other species are considered resistant.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Gram positive anaerobic cocci that are effective against the drug are Clostiridium, C. difficile, C. perfringens, Eubacterium, Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus. Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium acnes,</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>P. avidum and P. granulosum are known to be resistant.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Other microorganisms:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole is effective against Campylobacter fetus in vitro . Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis) is sensitive to high doses of metronidazole. Metronidazole was found to be ineffective against fungi in in vitro studies.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Resistance</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Some strains of Trichomonas vaginalis have developed resistance to metronidazole. Rarely, Bacteroides fragilis and other anaerobic bacteria may also acquire resistance after long-term use. Resistance to metronidazole may be due to poor cell penetration and/or nitroreductase activity.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Absorption:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Since it is administered by injection, all of the administered medication is transferred to the body.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Distribution:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mean serum levels obtained as a result of intravenous infusion of a solution containing 500 mg metronidazole over 20 minutes are 18 mcg/mL. If the same dose is repeated at 8 hour intervals, the serum levels are maintained. If it is repeated at 12 hour intervals, the serum level is 13 mcg/mL. The plasma half-life is 8-10 hours. Protein binding is low (less than 10%). Its distribution is rapid and its concentration is high in the lungs, kidneys, liver, skin, bile, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, seminal fluid and vaginal secretions.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Metronidazole crosses the placenta and breast milk.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Biotransformation:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It is metabolized in the liver and is found in high concentrations in the liver and bile. Metronidazole is metabolized in the body into two metabolites with antibacterial activity.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>“Alcohol” metabolite is the primary metabolite. Bactericidal effect against anaerobic bacteria 30% of the potency of metronidazole. Elimination half-life is approximately 11 hours.
  <br/>
The “acid” metabolite is present in small amounts and has a bactericidal effect of 5% of metronidazole.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Elimination:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Excretion occurs mainly via the urine (40-70% of metronidazole excreted unchanged) and therefore the urine may take on a red-brown colour.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>** Injections are quick procedures, typically completed in a few seconds to minutes, and involve delivering a single dose of medication directly into the muscle, skin, or vein. Infusions, on the other hand, take longer and involve a continuous flow of medication directly into the bloodstream. However, 100ml bags of Metronidazole can be used for both infusions and injections as their intended use is the same. Because of their small volume, they can be used together for infusions and injections, and in some cases, they are even administered concurrently or sequentially through the same IV line, depending on the medical need and drug compatibility.</paragraph>
