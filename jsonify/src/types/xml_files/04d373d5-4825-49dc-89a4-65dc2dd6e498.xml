                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets contains misoprostol, which provides protection against gastric and duodenal ulcers     <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (       <linkHtml href="#Section_14">14</linkHtml>)]     </content>. For gastric ulcer prevention, the 200 mcg four and three times a day regimens are therapeutically equivalent, but more protective than the two times a day regimen. For duodenal ulcer prevention, the four times a day regimen is more protective than the three or two times a day regimens. However, the four times a day regimen is less well tolerated than the three times a day regimen because of usually self-limited diarrhea related to the misoprostol dose     <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (       <linkHtml href="#Section_6.1">6.1</linkHtml>)]     </content>, and the two times a day regimen may be better tolerated than three times a day in some patients.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dosages may be individualized using the separate products (misoprostol and diclofenac sodium), after which the patient may be switched to the appropriate diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets dosage. If clinically indicated, misoprostol co-therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets to optimize the misoprostol dose and/or frequency of administration, may be appropriate. Do not exceed a total misoprostol dose of 800 mcg/day and do not administer more than 200 mcg of misoprostol at any one time.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors is necessary, the maximum total daily dose of diclofenac is 100 mg per day. Do not exceed a dosage of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg twice daily     <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (       <linkHtml href="#_RefSection_7">7</linkHtml>)]     </content>.   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required     <content styleCode="italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (       <linkHtml href="#Section_8.1">8.1</linkHtml>)]     </content>.    <br/>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events     <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (       <linkHtml href="#Section_5.17">5.3</linkHtml>)]     </content>.   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.

                        <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4 Hepatotoxicity</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with  diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and “flu-like” symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets     <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (       <linkHtml href="#_RefSection_7">7</linkHtml>)].     </content>Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs     <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (       <linkHtml href="#Section_4">4</linkHtml>)]     </content>.   </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding co-administration with magnesium-containing antacids.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in pregnant women; however, there is information available about the active drug components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol. Administration of misoprostol to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects     <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (       <linkHtml href="#Section_5.15">5.1</linkHtml>)]     </content>. Congenital anomalies sometimes associated with fetal death have been reported subsequent to the unsuccessful use of misoprostol as an abortifacient, but the drug’s teratogenic mechanism has not been demonstrated. Use of NSAIDS, including diclofenac a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment (     <content styleCode="italics">see Data</content>). There are clinical considerations when misoprostol and diclofenac are used in pregnant women     <content styleCode="italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</content>. In reproduction studies with pregnant rabbits, there were no skeletal or visceral malformations when the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol was administered during organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human doses (MRHD); however, embryotoxicity was observed at this exposure     <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Misoprostol may produce uterine contractions, uterine bleeding, and expulsion of the products of conception. Misoprostol has been used to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, outside of its approved indication. A major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus. Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, and maternal death have been reported when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor to induce abortion beyond the eighth week of pregnancy. Higher doses of misoprostol, including the 100 mcg tablet, may increase the risk of complications from uterine hyperstimulation. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, which contains 200 mcg of misoprostol, is likely to have a greater risk of uterine hyperstimulation than the 100 mcg tablet of misoprostol. Abortions caused by misoprostol may be incomplete.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cases of amniotic fluid embolism, which resulted in maternal and fetal death, have been reported with use of misoprostol during pregnancy. Severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, shock, and pelvic pain have also been reported. These women were administered misoprostol vaginally and/or orally over a range of doses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets or diclofenac during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth. In humans, some case reports and studies have associated misoprostol with risk of stillbirth, uterine hyperstimulation, perineal tear, amniotic fluid embolism, severe bleeding, shock, uterine rupture and death. The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy may occur at any gestational age, and increases with advancing gestational age and with prior uterine surgery, including cesarean delivery. Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The reproductive and developmental effects of both the combination of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets alone have been studied in animals. In all studies there was no evidence of teratogenicity. In an oral teratology study in pregnant rabbits, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets was administered at dose combinations (diclofenac and misoprostol, 250:1 ratio) up to 10 mg/kg/day diclofenac sodium (120 mg/m     <sup>2</sup>/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and 0.04 mg/kg/day misoprostol (0.48 mg/m     <sup>2</sup>/day, 0.8 times the MRHD based on body surface area) and there was no evidence of teratogenicity.

Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. A deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric and duodenal mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by NSAIDs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but it has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory. It is therefore not possible to differentiate whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric and duodenal ulcers is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>studies on canine parietal cells using titrated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors. Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereo-specific. The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine. Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity. It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misoprostol, over the range of 50 mcg to 200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee. Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours. In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter-lived, and only the 200 mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine- and meal-stimulated secretion.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misoprostol also produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation. It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor intrinsic factor output.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic profiles of diclofenac and misoprostol administered as the fixed combination (diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or 75 mg/200 mcg) are similar to the profiles when the two drugs are administered as separate tablets (see Table 2). No pharmacokinetic interaction between the two drugs has been observed following multiple dosing. The diclofenac total exposure [area under the curve (AUC)] is dose-proportional within the range of 25 mg to 150 mg. Approximately dose-proportional increase in misoprostol exposure was also observed within the range of 200 mcg to 400 mcg. Neither diclofenac nor misoprostol accumulated in plasma following repeated doses of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given every 12 hours under fasted conditions.</paragraph>

Peak plasma levels are less than dose-proportional and are approximately 1.5 and 2 mcg/mL for 50 mg and 75 mg doses, respectively.

                           </content>: Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine and 35% in the bile. The elimination half-life of diclofenac is approximately 2 hours. The clearance of diclofenac is approximately 350 mL/min (equivalent to 21 L/h).   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Conjugates of unchanged diclofenac account for 5% to 10% of the dose excreted in the urine and for less than 5% excreted in the bile. Little or no unchanged unconjugated drug is excreted. Conjugates of the principal metabolite account for 20% to 30% of the dose excreted in the urine and for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the bile.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Conjugates of three other metabolites together account for 10% to 20% of the dose excreted in the urine and for small amounts excreted in the bile. The elimination half-life values for these metabolites are shorter than those for the parent drug. Urinary excretion of an additional metabolite (half-life = 80 hours) accounts for only 1.4% of the oral dose. The degree of accumulation of diclofenac metabolites is unknown. Some of the metabolites may have activity.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term animal studies to evaluate the potential for carcinogenesis and animal studies to evaluate the effects on fertility have been performed with each component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets given alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 24 month rat carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 2.4 mg/kg/day (14.4 mg/m     <sup>2</sup>/day, 24 times the MRHD of 0.6 mg/m     <sup>2</sup>/day) was not tumorigenic. In a 21-month mouse carcinogenicity study, misoprostol administered orally at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (48 mg/m     <sup>2</sup>/day), 80 times the MRHD based on body surface area, was not tumorigenic.   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol on male or female fertility have not been studied in animals; however, there are data with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol given alone. Misoprostol, when administered to male and female breeding rats in an oral dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (0.6 to 60 mg/m     <sup>2</sup>/day, 1 to 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area) produced dose-related pre-and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose (60 mg/m     <sup>2</sup>/day, 100 times the MRHD based on body surface area). Diclofenac sodium at oral doses up to 4 mg/kg/day (24 mg/m     <sup>2</sup>/day, 0.16 times the MRHD based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse during long-term toxicology studies with misoprostol. No such increase has been observed in humans administered misoprostol for up to 1 year. An apparent response of the female mouse to misoprostol in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae. Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with misoprostol.    <br/>

                  <paragraph>Diclofenac, and other NSAIDs, have caused serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine or large intestine. Misoprostol has been shown to reduce the incidence of endoscopically diagnosed NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study, misoprostol 200 mcg administered four, three or two times a day, was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of gastric ulcer in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients using a variety of NSAIDs. The three times a day regimen was therapeutically equivalent to misoprostol 200 mcg four times a day with respect to the prevention of gastric ulcers. Misoprostol 200 mcg given two times a day was less effective than 200 mcg given three or four times a day. The incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer was also significantly reduced with all three regimens of misoprostol compared to placebo (see Table 3).</paragraph>
