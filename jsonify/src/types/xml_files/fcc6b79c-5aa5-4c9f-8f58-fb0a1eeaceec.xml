                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Shake well before use. Do not use if there is evidence of excessive creaming or aggregation, if large droplets are visible, or if there are other forms of phase separation indicating that the stability of the product has been compromised. Slight creaming, which should disappear after shaking, may be visible upon prolonged standing. Do not use if there is evidence of separation of the phases of the emulsion.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN with EDTA inhibits microbial growth for up to 12 hours, as demonstrated by test data for representative USP microorganisms. Product is packaged under nitrogen. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For general anesthesia or monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation, DIPRIVAN should be administered only by persons trained in the administration of general anesthesia and not involved in the conduct of the surgical/diagnostic procedure. Sedated patients should be continuously monitored, and equipment for maintaining a patent airway, providing artificial ventilation, administering supplemental oxygen, and instituting cardiovascular resuscitation must be immediately available. Patients should be continuously monitored for early signs of hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects are more likely to occur following rapid bolus administration, especially in the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For sedation of intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients in the Intensive Care Unit, DIPRIVAN should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN must be prepared for use just prior to initiation of each individual anesthetic/sedative procedure. The vial rubber stopper should be disinfected using 70% isopropyl alcohol. DIPRIVAN should be drawn into a sterile syringe immediately after a vial is opened. When withdrawing DIPRIVAN from vials, a sterile vent spike should be used. The syringe should be labelled with appropriate information including the date and time the vial was opened. Administration should commence promptly and be completed within 12 hours after the vial has been opened. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN must be prepared for single dose only. Any unused DIPRIVAN drug product, reservoirs, dedicated administration tubing and/or solutions containing DIPRIVAN must be discarded at the end of the anesthetic procedure or at 12 hours, whichever occurs sooner. The intravenous line should be flushed every 12 hours and at the end of the anesthetic procedure to remove residual DIPRIVAN. <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_fd861e8c-d32a-41ab-a71d-30c01a5b6c71">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Most adult patients under 65 years of age and classified as ASA-PS I or II require 2 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN. For induction, whether administered by infusion or intravenous injection the dose of DIPRIVAN to the patient should be titrated against the response of the patient and until there are clinical signs consistent with the onset of anesthesia. As with other sedative-hypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication may impact the dose of DIPRIVAN required for induction of general anesthesia.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients require approximately 1 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN for induction of anesthesia. For induction, whether administered by infusion or intravenous injection the dose administration of DIPRIVAN to the patient should be titrated against the response of the patient and until there are clinical signs consistent with the onset of anesthesia. A rapid bolus may increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression. <content styleCode="italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_c9d275a3-d20d-4e14-bd52-632a5c267c88">5.12</linkHtml>)]</content>

Within this dosage range, younger pediatric patients may require higher induction doses than older pediatric patients. As with other sedative-hypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication may impact the dose of DIPRIVAN required for induction of general anesthesia.

Whether administered by infusion or intravenous injection, the dose of DIPRIVAN to the patient should be titrated against the response of the patient until the clinical signs show the onset of anesthesia. Other agents used in addition to DIPRIVAN for induction and maintenance of anesthesia may require DIPRIVAN doses to be titrated to ensure adequate sedation level.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN has been well-studied in patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with hemodynamically significant valvular or congenital heart disease. No significant safety issues or changes to the induction of anesthesia is generally required for these patient groups. Dosing should be titrated based on depth of anesthesia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with other anesthetic and sedative-hypnotic agents, DIPRIVAN in healthy patients causes a decrease in blood pressure that is secondary to decreases in preload (ventricular filling volume at the end of the diastole) and afterload (arterial resistance at the beginning of the systole). The magnitude of these changes is proportional to the blood and effect site concentrations achieved. These concentrations depend upon the dose and speed of the induction and maintenance infusion rates.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In addition, lower heart rates are observed during maintenance with DIPRIVAN, possibly due to reduction of the sympathetic activity and/or resetting of the baroreceptor reflexes. Therefore, anticholinergic agents should be administered when increases in vagal tone are anticipated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with other anesthetic agents, DIPRIVAN reduces myocardial oxygen consumption.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Further studies are needed to confirm and delineate the extent of these effects on the myocardium and the coronary vascular system.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary DIPRIVAN maintenance infusion rates and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. The rate of DIPRIVAN administration should be determined based on the patient's premedication and adjusted according to clinical responses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN has been used with a variety of agents commonly used in anesthesia such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics, as well as with inhalational and regional anesthetic agents. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid bolus doses should not be used, as this will increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression. </paragraph>

Maintenance by infusion of DIPRIVAN should immediately follow the induction dose in order to provide satisfactory or continuous anesthesia during the induction phase. During this initial period following the induction dose, higher rates of infusion are generally required (150 mcg/kg/min to 200 mcg/kg/min) for the first 10 minutes to 15 minutes. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased 30% to 50% during the first half-hour of maintenance. Generally, rates of 50 mcg/kg/min to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>When DIPRIVAN is administered for MAC sedation, rates of administration should be individualized and titrated to clinical response. In most patients, the rates of DIPRIVAN administration will be in the range of 25 mcg/kg/min to 75 mcg/kg/min. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus dose administration. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_c9d275a3-d20d-4e14-bd52-632a5c267c88">5.12</linkHtml>)]</content>.

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For initiation of MAC sedation, either an infusion or a slow injection method may be utilized while closely monitoring cardiorespiratory function. With the infusion method, sedation may be initiated by infusing DIPRIVAN at 100 mcg/kg/min to 150 mcg/kg/min (6 mg/kg/hour to 9 mg/kg/hour) for a period of 3 minutes to 5 minutes and titrating to the desired clinical effect while closely monitoring respiratory function. With the slow injection method for initiation, patients will require approximately 0.5 mg/kg administered over 3 minutes to 5 minutes and titrated to clinical responses. When DIPRIVAN is administered slowly over 3 minutes to 5 minutes, most patients will be adequately sedated, and the peak drug effect can be achieved while minimizing undesirable cardiorespiratory effects occurring at high plasma levels.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_c9d275a3-d20d-4e14-bd52-632a5c267c88">5.12</linkHtml>)]. </content>The rate of administration should be over 3 minutes to 5 minutes and the dosage of DIPRIVAN should be reduced to approximately 80% of the usual adult dosage in these patients according to their condition, responses, and changes in vital signs. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For maintenance of sedation, a variable rate infusion method is preferable over an intermittent bolus dose method. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>With the variable rate infusion method, patients will generally require maintenance rates of 25 mcg/kg/min to 75 mcg/kg/min (1.5 mg/kg/hour to 4.5 mg/kg/hour) during the first 10 minutes to 15 minutes of sedation maintenance. Infusion rates should subsequently be decreased over time to 25 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min and adjusted to clinical responses. In titrating to clinical effect, allow approximately 2 minutes for onset of peak drug effect. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light sedation until mild responses to stimulation are obtained in order to avoid sedative administration of DIPRIVAN at rates higher than are clinically necessary. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the intermittent bolus dose method is used, increments of DIPRIVAN 10 mg (1 mL) or 20 mg (2 mL) can be administered and titrated to desired clinical effect. With the intermittent bolus method of sedation maintenance, there is increased potential for respiratory depression, transient increases in sedation depth, and prolongation of recovery. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_c9d275a3-d20d-4e14-bd52-632a5c267c88">5.12</linkHtml>)]</content>.

                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN can be administered as the sole agent for maintenance of MAC sedation during surgical/diagnostic procedures. When DIPRIVAN sedation is supplemented with opioid and/or benzodiazepine medications, these agents increase the sedative and respiratory effects of DIPRIVAN and may also result in a slower recovery profile <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_2ae84c94-f006-4514-927f-7177ef98559d">7</linkHtml>)].</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Changes in vital signs indicating a stress response to surgical stimulation or the emergence from anesthesia may be controlled by the administration of 25 mg (2.5 mL) to 50 mg (5 mL) incremental boluses and/or by increasing the infusion rate of DIPRIVAN.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For minor surgical procedures (e.g., body surface) nitrous oxide (60% to 70%) can be combined with a variable rate DIPRIVAN infusion to provide satisfactory anesthesia. With more stimulating surgical procedures (e.g., intra-abdominal), or if supplementation with nitrous oxide is not provided, administration rate(s) of DIPRIVAN and/or opioids should be increased in order to provide adequate anesthesia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Infusion rates should always be titrated downward in the absence of clinical signs of light anesthesia in order to avoid administration of DIPRIVAN at rates higher than are clinically necessary. Generally, rates of 50 mcg/kg/min to 100 mcg/kg/min in adults should be achieved during maintenance in order to optimize recovery times.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Other drugs that cause CNS depression (hypnotics/sedatives, inhalational anesthetics, and opioids) can increase CNS depression induced by propofol. Morphine premedication (0.15 mg/kg) with nitrous oxide 67% in oxygen has been shown to decrease the necessary propofol injection maintenance infusion rate and therapeutic blood concentrations when compared to non-narcotic (lorazepam) premedication. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Propofol blood concentrations at steady-state are generally proportional to infusion rates, especially in individual patients. Undesirable effects such as cardiorespiratory depression are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in the infusion rate. An adequate interval (3 minutes to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments to allow for and assess the clinical effects. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), DIPRIVAN can be administered to intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients to provide continuous sedation and control of stress responses only by persons skilled in the medical management of critically ill patients and trained in cardiovascular resuscitation and airway management. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN should be individualized according to the patient's condition and response, blood lipid profile, and vital signs [see <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_fd72e26f-efd4-4b4f-9419-522b9842c865">5.8</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_c4ea3c17-054b-4809-9f77-b68355516cdf">5.9</linkHtml>, and <linkHtml href="#ID_89ce2782-eb0f-434e-946c-8e91ba2006ad">5.10</linkHtml>)</content>]. For intubated, mechanically ventilated adult patients, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sedation should be initiated slowly with a continuous infusion in order to titrate to desired clinical effect and minimize hypotension. When indicated, initiation of sedation should begin at 5 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour). The infusion rate should be increased by increments of 5 mcg/kg/min to 10 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour to 0.6 mg/kg/hour) until the desired level of sedation is achieved. A minimum period of 5 minutes between adjustments should be allowed for onset of peak drug effect.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Most adult ICU patients recovering from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation will require maintenance rates of 5 mcg/kg/min to 50 mcg/kg/min (0.3 mg/kg/hour to 3 mg/kg/hour) titrated to desired level of clinical response. With medical ICU patients or patients who have recovered from the effects of general anesthesia or deep sedation, the rate of administration of 50 mcg/kg/min or higher may be required to achieve adequate sedation. These higher rates of administration may increase the likelihood of patients developing hypotension. Administration should not exceed 4 mg/kg/hour unless the benefits outweigh the risks <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_fd72e26f-efd4-4b4f-9419-522b9842c865">5.8</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dosage and rate of administration should be individualized and titrated to the desired effect, according to clinically relevant factors including the patientâs underlying medical problems, preinduction and concomitant medications, age, ASA-PS classification, and level of debilitation of the patient. The elderly, debilitated, and ASA-PS III or IV patients may have exaggerated hemodynamic and respiratory responses to rapid bolus doses <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_c9d275a3-d20d-4e14-bd52-632a5c267c88">5.12</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dosages of DIPRIVAN should be reduced in patients who have received large dosages of opioids. The DIPRIVAN dosage requirement may also be reduced by adequate management of pain with analgesic agents. As with other sedative medications, there is interpatient variability in dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID_42c082e6-72d6-4fc2-a044-bef797dacbb7">2.6</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.2 Risks of Microbial Contamination </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling. DIPRIVAN is a single-dose parenteral product (single patient infusion vial) which contains 0.005% disodium edetate (EDTA) to inhibit the rate of growth of microorganisms, for up to 12 hours, in the event of accidental extrinsic contamination. However, DIPRIVAN can still support the growth of microorganisms, as it is not an antimicrobially preserved product under USP standards. Do not use if contamination is suspected. Discard unused drug product as directed within the required time limits. There have been reports in which failure to use aseptic technique when handling DIPRIVAN was associated with microbial contamination of the product and with fever, infection/sepsis, other life-threatening illness, and/or death. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN vials are never to be accessed more than once or used on more than one person. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There have been reports, in the literature and other public sources, of the transmission of bloodborne pathogens (such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV) from unsafe injection practices, and of the use of propofol vials intended for single use on multiple persons.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.3 Risks of Pediatric Neurotoxicity </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans <content styleCode="italics">[see Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID_23ab8fcf-f2ea-4ebe-843b-8ffeab2e08b2">13.2</linkHtml>)].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>When DIPRIVAN is used in patients with increased intracranial pressure or impaired cerebral circulation, significant decreases in mean arterial pressure should be avoided because of the resultant decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure. To avoid significant hypotension and decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure, an infusion or slow bolus should be utilized instead of rapid, more frequent, and/or larger boluses of DIPRIVAN. Slower induction, titrated to clinical responses, will generally result in reduced induction dosage requirements (1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg). When increased ICP is suspected, hyperventilation and hypocarbia should accompany the administration of DIPRIVAN <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID_9fa745ab-94de-4c9e-814a-6c698168d19a">2.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Slower rates of administration should be utilized in premedicated patients, geriatric patients, patients with recent fluid shifts, and patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Fluid deficits should be corrected prior to administration of DIPRIVAN. In those patients where additional fluid therapy may be contraindicated, other measures, e.g., elevation of lower extremities, or use of pressor agents, may be useful to offset the hypotension which is associated with the induction of anesthesia with DIPRIVAN. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The administration of DIPRIVAN should be initiated as a continuous infusion and changes in the rate of administration made slowly (&gt;5 min) in order to minimize hypotension and avoid acute overdosage <content styleCode="italics">[see Overdosage (<linkHtml href="#ID_8eea583c-d5c1-445c-9629-ba3d3576a550">10</linkHtml>) and Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID_60ec6c14-efa5-40ad-bd7e-d6f1a2fce2f1">2.5</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be monitored for early signs of significant hypotension and/or cardiovascular depression, which may be profound. These effects are responsive to discontinuation of DIPRIVAN, intravenous fluid administration, and/or vasopressor therapy. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus administration should not be used during sedation in order to minimize undesirable cardiorespiratory depression. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with other sedative medications, there is wide interpatient variability in DIPRIVAN dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Failure to reduce the infusion rate in patients receiving DIPRIVAN for extended periods may result in excessively high blood concentrations of the drug. Thus, titration to clinical response and daily evaluation of sedation levels are important during use of DIPRIVAN infusion for ICU sedation, especially when it is used for long durations. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids and paralytic agents should be discontinued and respiratory function optimized prior to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation. Infusions of DIPRIVAN should be adjusted to maintain a light level of sedation prior to weaning patients from mechanical ventilatory support. Throughout the weaning process, this level of sedation may be maintained in the absence of respiratory depression. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abrupt discontinuation of DIPRIVAN prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. It is therefore recommended that administration of DIPRIVAN be continued in order to maintain a light level of sedation throughout the weaning process until 10 to 15 minutes prior to extubation, at which time the infusion can be discontinued. </paragraph>

                     <title>5.9 Risks of Propofol Infusion Syndrome in Patients with ICU Sedation </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Use of DIPRIVAN infusions for both adult and pediatric ICU sedation has been associated with a constellation of metabolic derangements and organ system failures, referred to as Propofol Infusion Syndrome, that have resulted in death. The syndrome is characterized by severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, lipemia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatomegaly, renal failure, ECG changes (Coved ST segment elevation -similar to ECG changes of the Brugada syndrome) and/or cardiac failure. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following appear to be major risk factors for the development of these events: decreased oxygen delivery to tissues; serious neurological injury and/or sepsis; high dosages of one or more of the following pharmacological agents: vasoconstrictors, steroids, inotropes and/or prolonged, high-dose infusions of propofol (&gt; 5 mg/kg/hour for &gt; 48 hours). The syndrome has also been reported following large-dose, short-term infusions during surgical anesthesia. In the setting of prolonged need for sedation, increasing propofol dose requirements to maintain a constant level of sedation, or onset of metabolic acidosis during administration of a propofol infusion, consideration should be given to using alternative means of sedation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prescribers should be alert to these events in patients with the above risk factors and immediately discontinue propofol when the above signs develop.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN use requires caution when administered to patients with disorders of lipid metabolism such as primary hyperlipoproteinemia, diabetic hyperlipemia, and pancreatitis. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Since DIPRIVAN is formulated in an oil-in-water emulsion, elevations in serum triglycerides may occur when DIPRIVAN is administered for extended periods of time. Patients at risk of hyperlipidemia should be monitored for increases in serum triglycerides or serum turbidity. Administration of DIPRIVAN should be adjusted if fat is being inadequately cleared from the body. A reduction in the quantity of concurrently administered lipids is indicated to compensate for the amount of lipid infused as part of the DIPRIVAN formulation; 1 mL of DIPRIVAN contains approximately 0.1 g of fat (1.1 kcal).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>EDTA is a strong chelator of trace metals â including zinc. Although with DIPRIVAN there are no reports of decreased zinc levels or zinc deficiency-related adverse events, DIPRIVAN should not be infused for longer than 5 days without providing a drug holiday to safely replace estimated or measured urine zinc losses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials mean urinary zinc loss was approximately 2.5 mg/day to 3 mg/day in adult patients and 1.5 mg/day to 2 mg/day in pediatric patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients who are predisposed to zinc deficiency, such as those with burns, diarrhea, and/or major sepsis, the need for supplemental zinc should be considered during prolonged therapy with DIPRIVAN.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.13 Risk of Transient Local Pain   </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Attention should be paid to minimize pain on administration of DIPRIVAN. Transient local pain can be minimized if the larger veins of the forearm or antecubital fossa are used. Pain during intravenous injection may also be reduced by prior injection of intravenous lidocaine (1 mL of a 1% solution). Pain on injection occurred frequently in pediatric patients (45%) when a small vein of the hand was utilized without lidocaine pretreatment. With lidocaine pretreatment or when antecubital veins were utilized, pain was minimal (incidence less than 10%) and well-tolerated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There have been reports in the literature indicating that the addition of lidocaine to DIPRIVAN in quantities greater than 20 mg lidocaine/200 mg DIPRIVAN results in instability of the emulsion which is associated with increases in globule sizes over time and (in rat studies) a reduction in anesthetic potency. Therefore, it is recommended that lidocaine be administered prior to DIPRIVAN administration or that it be added to DIPRIVAN immediately before administration and in quantities not exceeding 20 mg lidocaine/200 mg DIPRIVAN. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In the description below, rates of the more common events represent US/Canadian clinical study results. Less frequent events are also derived from publications and marketing experience in over 8 million patients; there are insufficient data to support an accurate estimate of their incidence rates. These studies were conducted using a variety of premedicants, varying lengths of surgical/diagnostic procedures, and various other anesthetic/sedative agents. Most adverse events were mild and transient.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The following estimates of adverse events for DIPRIVAN include data from clinical trials in general anesthesia/MAC sedation (N=2889 adult patients). The adverse events listed below as probably causally related are those events in which the actual incidence rate in patients treated with DIPRIVAN was greater than the comparator incidence rate in these trials. Therefore, incidence rates for anesthesia and MAC sedation in adults generally represent estimates of the percentage of clinical trial patients which appeared to have probable causal relationship.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The adverse experience profile from reports of 150 patients in the MAC sedation clinical trials is similar to the profile established with DIPRIVAN during anesthesia (see <linkHtml href="#table3" title="Table 3">Table 3</linkHtml> below). During MAC sedation clinical trials, significant respiratory events included cough, upper airway obstruction, apnea, hypoventilation, and dyspnea. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The induction dose requirements of DIPRIVAN may be reduced in patients with intramuscular or intravenous premedication, particularly with opioids (e.g., morphine, meperidine, and fentanyl, etc.) and combinations of opioids and sedatives (e.g., benzodiazepines, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, droperidol, etc.). These agents may increase the anesthetic or sedative effects of DIPRIVAN and may also result in more pronounced decreases in systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures and cardiac output. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>During maintenance of anesthesia or sedation, the rate of DIPRIVAN administration should be adjusted according to the desired level of anesthesia or sedation and may be reduced in the presence of supplemental analgesic agents (e.g., nitrous oxide or opioids).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The concurrent administration of potent inhalational agents (e.g., isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane, and halothane) during maintenance with DIPRIVAN are routinely used. These inhalational agents can also be expected to increase the anesthetic or sedative and cardiorespiratory effects of DIPRIVAN.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and case series over several decades with propofol use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Most of the reported exposures to propofol describe propofol exposure at the time of cesarean delivery. There are reports of neonatal depression in infants exposed to propofol during delivery <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#ID_e15fe09d-b4d0-4dd1-a9d6-bf1d0ad4f91c">Clinical Considerations</linkHtml>).</content> In animal reproduction studies, decreased pup survival concurrent with increased maternal mortality was observed with intravenous administration of propofol to pregnant rats either prior to mating and during early gestation or during late gestation and early lactation at exposures less than the human induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg. In pregnant rats administered 15 mg/kg/day intravenous propofol (equivalent to the human induction dose) from two weeks prior to mating to early in gestation (Gestation Day 7), offspring that were allowed to mate had increased postimplantation losses. The pharmacological activity (anesthesia) of the drug on the mother is probably responsible for the adverse effects seen in the offspring.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Published studies in pregnant primates demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity during the period of peak brain development increases neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring when used for longer than 3 hours. There are no data on pregnancy exposures in primates corresponding to periods prior to the third trimester in humans <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_18f72e9a-cb5d-49cc-97fc-43530ff1eaf1">Data</linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2â4% and 15â20%, respectively.</paragraph>

Propofol did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at exposures up to 1 times the human induction dose despite evidence of maternal toxicity (decreased weight gain in all groups).</paragraph>

Propofol treatment decreased total numbers of corpora lutea in all treatment groups but did not cause fetal malformations at any dose despite maternal toxicity (one maternal death from anesthesia-related respiratory depression in the high dose group).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Pregnant rats were administered propofol intravenously at 0, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day (0.65 and 1 times the human induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg based on body surface area) from late gestation through lactation (Gestation Day 16 to Lactation Day 22). Decreased pup survival was noted at all doses in the presence of maternal toxicity (deaths from anesthesia- induced respiratory depression). This study did not evaluate neurobehavioral function including learning and memory in the pups. </paragraph>

Pup (F1) survival was decreased on Day 15 and 22 of lactation at maternally toxic doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg/day. When F1 offspring were allowed to mate, postimplantation losses were increased in the 15 mg/kg/day treatment group. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus. In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring. With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human.

                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of DIPRIVAN have been established for induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients aged 3 years and older and for the maintenance of anesthesia aged 2 months and older.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pediatric patients, administration of fentanyl concomitantly with DIPRIVAN may result in serious bradycardia <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_1ea52f54-bd0e-4184-a776-e65485351b66">5.4</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN is not indicated for use in pediatric patients for ICU sedation or for MAC sedation for surgical, nonsurgical or diagnostic procedures as safety and effectiveness have not been established. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There have been anecdotal reports of serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients with upper respiratory tract infections receiving DIPRIVAN for ICU sedation. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In one multicenter clinical trial of ICU sedation in critically ill pediatric patients that excluded patients with upper respiratory tract infections, the incidence of mortality observed in patients who received DIPRIVAN (n=222) was 9%, while that for patients who received standard sedative agents (n=105) was 4%. While causality was not established in this study, DIPRIVAN is not indicated for ICU sedation in pediatric patients until further studies have been performed to document its safety in that population <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID_58ad19fe-9abf-4a61-a7f4-fe3f8af279f2">12.3</linkHtml>) and Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID_9fa745ab-94de-4c9e-814a-6c698168d19a">2.1</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_9830241e-c0eb-4e8e-b99b-ea5f63fa229d">2.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. However, propofol infusions are routinely used to provide safe sedation to critically ill pediatric patients in ICUs. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pediatric patients, abrupt discontinuation of DIPRIVAN following prolonged infusion may result in flushing of the hands and feet, agitation, tremulousness and hyperirritability. Increased incidences of bradycardia (5%), agitation (4%), and jitteriness (9%) have also been observed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as DIPRIVAN, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In primates, exposure to 3 hours of ketamine that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer of isoflurane increased neuronal cell loss. Data from isoflurane-treated rodents and ketamine-treated primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women, neonates, and young children who require procedures with the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precaution (<linkHtml href="#ID_568464eb-84f9-47b0-8731-bc53a44dabcf">5.3</linkHtml>), Pregnancy (<linkHtml href="#ID_23aeff74-f33f-4b52-b1b3-e302a750aed5">8.1</linkHtml>), and Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID_23ab8fcf-f2ea-4ebe-843b-8ffeab2e08b2">13.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of age on induction dose requirements for propofol was assessed in an open-label study involving 211 unpremedicated patients with approximately 30 patients in each decade between the ages of 16 and 80. The average dose to induce anesthesia was calculated for patients up to 54 years of age and for patients 55 years of age or older. The average dose to induce anesthesia in patients up to 54 years of age was 1.99 mg/kg and in patients above 54 it was 1.66 mg/kg.

                  <paragraph>DIPRIVAN is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. </paragraph>

                     <title>12.2 Pharmacodynamics </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Pharmacodynamic properties of propofol are dependent upon the therapeutic blood propofol concentrations. Steady-state propofol blood concentrations are generally proportional to infusion rates. Undesirable side effects, such as cardiorespiratory depression, are likely to occur at higher blood concentrations which result from bolus dosing or rapid increases in infusion rates. An adequate interval (3 to 5 minutes) must be allowed between dose adjustments in order to assess clinical effects. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The hemodynamic effects of DIPRIVAN during induction of anesthesia vary. If spontaneous ventilation is maintained, the major cardiovascular effect is arterial hypotension (sometimes greater than a 30% decrease) with little or no change in heart rate and no appreciable decrease in cardiac output. If ventilation is assisted or controlled (positive pressure ventilation), there is an increase in the incidence and the degree of depression of cardiac output. Addition of an opioid, used as a premedicant, further decreases cardiac output and respiratory drive. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If anesthesia is continued by infusion of DIPRIVAN, the stimulation of endotracheal intubation and surgery may return arterial pressure towards normal. However, cardiac output may remain depressed. Comparative clinical studies have shown that the hemodynamic effects of DIPRIVAN during induction of anesthesia are generally more pronounced than with other intravenous induction agents.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Induction of anesthesia with DIPRIVAN is frequently associated with apnea in both adults and pediatric patients. In adult patients who received DIPRIVAN (2 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg), apnea lasted less than 30 seconds in 7% of patients, 30 seconds to 60 seconds in 24% of patients, and more than 60 seconds in 12% of patients. In pediatric patients from birth through 16 years of age assessable for apnea who received bolus doses of DIPRIVAN (1 mg/kg to 3.6 mg/kg), apnea lasted less than 30 seconds in 12% of patients, 30 seconds to 60 seconds in 10% of patients, and more than 60 seconds in 5% of patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During maintenance of general anesthesia, DIPRIVAN causes a decrease in spontaneous minute ventilation usually associated with an increase in carbon dioxide tension which may be marked depending upon the rate of administration and concurrent use of other medications (e.g., opioids, sedatives, etc.).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation, attention must be given to the cardiorespiratory effects of DIPRIVAN. Hypotension, oxyhemoglobin desaturation, apnea, and airway obstruction can occur, especially following a rapid bolus of DIPRIVAN. During initiation of MAC sedation, slow infusion or slow injection techniques are preferable over rapid bolus administration. During maintenance of MAC sedation, a variable rate infusion is preferable over intermittent bolus administration in order to minimize undesirable cardiorespiratory effects. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus dose administration should not be used for MAC sedation <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_c9d275a3-d20d-4e14-bd52-632a5c267c88">5.12</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that DIPRIVAN is rarely associated with elevation of plasma histamine levels.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Preliminary findings in patients with normal intraocular pressure indicate that DIPRIVAN produces a decrease in intraocular pressure which may be associated with a concomitant decrease in systemic vascular resistance.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinical studies indicate that DIPRIVAN when used in combination with hypocarbia increases cerebrovascular resistance and decreases cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic oxygen consumption, and intracranial pressure. DIPRIVAN does not affect cerebrovascular reactivity to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#ID_2546d6ad-ceff-4b8f-81e8-c26b86affc9c">14.2</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies indicate that DIPRIVAN does not suppress the adrenal response to ACTH.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Animal studies and limited experience in susceptible patients have not indicated any propensity of DIPRIVAN to induce malignant hyperthermia.</paragraph>

                     <title>12.3 Pharmacokinetics </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of propofol are well described by a three- compartment linear model with compartments representing the plasma, rapidly equilibrating tissues, and slowly equilibrating tissues. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following an intravenous bolus dose, there is rapid equilibration between the plasma and the brain, accounting for the rapid onset of anesthesia. Plasma levels initially decline rapidly as a result of both distribution and metabolic clearance. Distribution accounts for about half of this decline following a bolus of propofol. However, distribution is not constant over time, but decreases as body tissues equilibrate with plasma and become saturated. The rate at which equilibration occurs is a function of the rate and duration of the infusion. When equilibration occurs there is no longer a net transfer of propofol between tissues and plasma. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Discontinuation of the recommended doses of DIPRIVAN after the maintenance of anesthesia for approximately one hour, or for sedation in the ICU for one day, results in a prompt decrease in blood propofol concentrations and rapid awakening. Longer infusions (10 days of ICU sedation) result in accumulation of significant tissue stores of propofol, such that the reduction in circulating propofol is slowed and the time to awakening is increased. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>By daily titration of DIPRIVAN dosage to achieve only the minimum effective therapeutic concentration, rapid awakening within 10 to 15 minutes can occur even after long-term administration. If, however, higher than necessary infusion levels have been maintained for a long time, propofol redistribution from fat and muscle to the plasma can be significant and slow recovery.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The figure below illustrates the fall of plasma propofol levels following infusions of various durations to provide ICU sedation. </paragraph>
                        <renderMultiMedia ID="id48730801" referencedObject="ID_9322b4c4-34c0-4142-b714-dafe3911ddae"/>
                        <paragraph>The large contribution of distribution (about 50%) to the fall of propofol plasma levels following brief infusions means that after very long infusions a reduction in the infusion rate is appropriate by as much as half the initial infusion rate in order to maintain a constant plasma level. Therefore, failure to reduce the infusion rate in patients receiving DIPRIVAN for extended periods may result in excessively high blood concentrations of the drug. Thus, titration to clinical response and daily evaluation of sedation levels are important during use of DIPRIVAN infusion for ICU sedation. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Propofol clearance ranges from 23 mL/kg/min to 50 mL/kg/min (1.6 L/min to 3.4 L/min in 70 kg adults). It is chiefly eliminated by hepatic conjugation to inactive metabolites which are excreted by the kidney. A glucuronide conjugate accounts for about 50% of the administered dose. Propofol has a steady-state volume of distribution (10-day infusion) approaching 60 L/kg in healthy adults. A difference in pharmacokinetics due to gender has not been observed. The terminal half-life of propofol after a 10-day infusion is 1 day to 3 days. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>With increasing patient age, the dose of propofol needed to achieve a defined anesthetic end point (dose-requirement) decreases. This does not appear to be an age-related change in pharmacodynamics or brain sensitivity, as measured by EEG burst suppression. With increasing patient age, pharmacokinetic changes are such that, for a given intravenous bolus dose, higher peak plasma concentrations occur, which can explain the decreased dose requirement. These higher peak plasma concentrations in the elderly can predispose patients to cardiorespiratory effects including hypotension, apnea, airway obstruction, and/or arterial oxygen desaturation. The higher plasma levels reflect an age-related decrease in volume of distribution and intercompartmental clearance. Lower doses are therefore recommended for initiation and maintenance of sedation and anesthesia in elderly patients <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID_0134e2b3-5790-4089-8a0b-8dd733945f73">2</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Published studies in animals demonstrate that the use of anesthetic agents during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In primates, exposure to 3 hours of an anesthetic regimen that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer increased neuronal cell loss. Data in rodents and in primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with subtle but prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in neonates and young children who require procedures against the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_568464eb-84f9-47b0-8731-bc53a44dabcf">5.3</linkHtml>); Pregnancy (<linkHtml href="#ID_23aeff74-f33f-4b52-b1b3-e302a750aed5">8.1</linkHtml>), and Pediatric Use (<linkHtml href="#ID_44161eee-4b47-45b1-a68c-33f992a16f4f">8.4</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN was studied in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumors in two clinical trials. The mean lesion size (anterior/posterior Ã lateral) was 31 mm Ã 32 mm in one trial and 55 mm Ã 42 mm in the other trial respectively. Anesthesia was induced with a median DIPRIVAN dose of 1.4 mg/kg (range: 0.9 mg/kg to 6.9 mg/kg) and maintained with a median maintenance DIPRIVAN dose of 146 mcg/kg/min (range: 68 mcg/kg/min to 425 mcg/kg/min). The median duration of the DIPRIVAN maintenance infusion was 285 minutes (range: 48 minutes to 622 minutes). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN was administered by infusion in a controlled clinical trial to evaluate its effect on cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP). The mean arterial pressure was maintained relatively constant over 25 minutes with a change from baseline of -4% Â± 17% (mean Â± SD). The change in CSFP was -46% Â± 14%. As CSFP is an indirect measure of intracranial pressure (ICP), DIPRIVAN, when given by infusion or slow bolus in combination with hypocarbia, is capable of decreasing ICP independent of changes in arterial pressure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In post-CABG (coronary artery bypass graft) patients, the maintenance rate of propofol administration was usually low (median 11 mcg/kg/min) due to the intraoperative administration of high opioid doses. Patients receiving DIPRIVAN required 35% less nitroprusside than midazolam patients. During initiation of sedation in post-CABG patients, a 15% to 20% decrease in blood pressure was seen in the first 60 minutes. It was not possible to determine cardiovascular effects in patients with severely compromised ventricular function. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN was compared to benzodiazepines and opioids in clinical trials involving ICU patients. Of these, 302 received DIPRIVAN and comprise the overall safety database for ICU sedation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Across all clinical studies, the mean infusion maintenance rate for all DIPRIVAN patients was 27 Â± 21 mcg/kg/min. The maintenance infusion rates required to maintain adequate sedation ranged from 2.8 mcg/kg/min to 130 mcg/kg/min. The infusion rate was lower in patients over 55 years of age (approximately 20 mcg/kg/min) compared to patients under 55 years of age (approximately 38 mcg/kg/min). Although there are reports of reduced analgesic requirements, most patients received opioids for analgesia during maintenance of ICU sedation. In these studies, morphine or fentanyl was used as needed for analgesia. Some patients also received benzodiazepines and/or neuromuscular blocking agents. During long-term maintenance of sedation, some ICU patients were awakened once or twice every 24 hours for assessment of neurologic or respiratory function. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Medical and Postsurgical ICU studies comparing DIPRIVAN to benzodiazepine infusion or bolus, there were no apparent differences in maintenance of adequate sedation, mean arterial pressure, or laboratory findings. Like the comparators, DIPRIVAN reduced blood cortisol during sedation while maintaining responsivity to challenges with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Case reports from the published literature generally reflect that DIPRIVAN has been used safely in patients with a history of porphyria or malignant hyperthermia. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In hemodynamically stable head trauma patients ranging in age from 19 to 43 years, adequate sedation was maintained with DIPRIVAN or morphine. There were no apparent differences in adequacy of sedation, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, or neurologic recovery between the treatment groups. In literature reports of severely head injured patients in Neurosurgical ICUs, DIPRIVAN infusion and hyperventilation, both with and without diuretics, controlled intracranial pressure while maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure. In some patients, bolus doses resulted in decreased blood pressure and compromised cerebral perfusion pressure. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIPRIVAN was found to be effective in status epilepticus which was refractory to the standard anticonvulsant therapies. For these patients, as well as for ARDS/respiratory failure and tetanus patients, sedation maintenance dosages were generally higher than those for other critically ill patient populations. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A single, randomized, controlled, clinical trial that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of DIPRIVAN versus standard sedative agents (SSA) was conducted on 327 pediatric ICU patients. Patients were randomized to receive either DIPRIVAN 2%, (113 patients), DIPRIVAN 1%, (109 patients), or an SSA (e.g., lorazepam, chloral hydrate, fentanyl, ketamine, morphine, or phenobarbital). DIPRIVAN therapy was initiated at an infusion rate of 5.5 mg/kg/hr and titrated as needed to maintain sedation at a standardized level. The results of the study showed an increase in the number of deaths in patients treated with DIPRIVAN as compared to SSAs. Of the 25 patients who died during the trial or within the 28-day follow up period: 12 (11% were) in the DIPRIVAN 2% treatment group, 9 (8% were) in the DIPRIVAN 1% treatment group, and 4% were (4%) in the SSA treatment group. The differences in mortality rate between the groups were not statistically significant.
