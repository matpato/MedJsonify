If symptom control is still maintained at 3 months an attempt to taper to complete cessation is recommended. Continued treatment with budesonide delayed-release capsules 6 mg for more than 3 months has not been shown to provide substantial clinical benefit.</paragraph>

Since prednisolone should not be stopped abruptly, tapering should begin concomitantly with initiating budesonide delayed-release capsules treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including budesonide delayed-release capsules. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with budesonide delayed-release capsules. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.</paragraph>

In the long-term clinical trials, the following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 5% and are not listed in Table 1: diarrhea (10%); sinusitis (8%); infection viral (6%); and arthralgia (5%).</paragraph>

Bone mineral density decreased significantly less with budesonide delayed-release capsules than with prednisolone in steroid-naïve patients, whereas no difference could be detected between treatment groups for steroid-dependent patients and previous steroid users. The incidence of symptoms associated with hypercorticism was significantly higher with prednisolone treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Budesonide is a substrate for CYP3A4. Avoid use with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant oral administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) caused an eight-fold increase of the systemic exposure to oral budesonide. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and cyclosporine) can increase systemic budesonide concentrations

                        <paragraph>Limited published studies report on the use of budesonide in pregnant women; however, the data are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are clinical considerations
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</content>. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant rats and rabbits, administration of subcutaneous budesonide during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.5 times or 0.05 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose, resulted in increased fetal loss, decreased pup weights, and skeletal abnormalities. Maternal toxicity was observed in both rats and rabbits at these dose levels

                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed subcutaneously with budesonide during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-15 there were effects on fetal development and survival at subcutaneous doses up to approximately 500 mcg/kg in rats (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-18, there was an increase in maternal abortion, and effects on fetal development and reduction in litter weights at subcutaneous doses up to approximately 25 mcg/kg in rabbits (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). Maternal toxicity, including reduction in body weight gain, was observed at subcutaneous doses of 5 mcg/kg in rabbits (approximately 0.01 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) and 500 mcg/kg in rats (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>

In addition, offspring survival was reduced and surviving offspring had decreased mean body weights at birth and during lactation at exposures 0.02 times the MRHD (on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 20 mcg/kg/day and higher). These findings occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity.

                        <paragraph>Lactation studies have not been conducted with oral budesonide, including budesonide delayed-release capsules, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. One published study reports that budesonide is present in human milk following maternal inhalation of budesonide
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for budesonide delayed-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from budesonide delayed-release capsules, or from the underlying maternal condition.

                        <paragraph>One published study reports that budesonide is present in human milk following maternal inhalation of budesonide which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.3% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Budesonide plasma concentrations were not detected and no adverse events were noted in the breastfed infants following maternal use of inhaled budesonide. The recommended daily dose of budesonide delayed-release capsules is higher (up to 9 mg daily) compared with inhaled budesonide (up to 800 mcg daily) given to mothers in the above described study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The maximum budesonide plasma concentration following a 9 mg daily dose (in both single- and repeated-dose pharmacokinetic studies) of oral budesonide is approximately 2.15 to 4.31 ng/mL which is up to 10 times higher than the 0.43 to 0.86 ng/mL for a 800 mcg daily dose of inhaled budesonide at steady state in the above inhalation study. Assuming the coefficient of extrapolation between the inhaled and oral doses is constant across all dose levels, at therapeutic doses of budesonide delayed-release capsules, budesonide exposure to the nursing child may be up to 10 times higher than that by budesonide inhalation.</paragraph>

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>

Following administration of 9 mg budesonide delayed-release capsules once daily for 7 days, the median time to peak plasma concentration of budesonide was 5 hours and the mean peak plasma concentration was 2.58 ± 1.51 ng/mL. The mean AUC was 17.78 ± 5.25 ng•hr/mL and 17% higher than that in adult patients with Crohn’s disease in the same study. The mean absolute oral availability was 9.2% (3 to 17%; n=4) in pediatric patients.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Carcinogenicity studies with budesonide were conducted in rats and mice. In a two-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of gliomas in male rats at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). In addition, there were increased incidences of primary hepatocellular tumors in male rats at 25 mcg/kg (approximately 0.023 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) and above. No tumorigenicity was seen in female rats at oral doses up to 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). In an additional two-year study in male Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused no gliomas at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). However, it caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.05 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). The concurrent reference corticosteroids (prednisolone and triamcinolone acetonide) showed similar findings. In a 91-week study in mice, budesonide caused no treatment-related carcinogenicity at oral doses up to 200 mcg/kg (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Budesonide was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma cell forward gene mutation (TK
 
  <sup>+/-</sup>) test, the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test, the
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Drosophila melanogaster</content>sex-linked recessive lethality test, the rat hepatocyte UDS test and the mouse micronucleus test.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In rats, budesonide had no effect on fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 80 mcg/kg (approximately 0.07 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis). However, it caused a decrease in prenatal viability and viability in pups at birth and during lactation, along with a decrease in maternal body-weight gain, at subcutaneous doses of 20 mcg/kg (approximately 0.02 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) and above. No such effects were noted at 5 mcg/kg (approximately 0.005 times the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of budesonide delayed-release capsules were evaluated in 994 patients with mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease of the ileum and/or ascending colon in 5 randomized and double-blind studies of 8 weeks duration. The study patients ranged in age from 17 to 85 (mean 35), 40% were male and 97% were white. The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was the main clinical assessment used for determining efficacy in these 5 studies.
 
  <sup>1</sup>The CDAI is a validated index based on subjective aspects rated by the patient (frequency of liquid or very soft stools, abdominal pain rating and general well-being) and objective observations (number of extraintestinal symptoms, need for antidiarrheal drugs, presence of abdominal mass, body weight and hematocrit). Clinical improvement, defined as a CDAI score of less than or equal to 150 assessed after 8 weeks of treatment, was the primary efficacy variable in these 5 comparative efficacy studies of budesonide delayed-release capsules. Safety assessments in these studies included monitoring of adverse reactions. A checklist of potential symptoms of hypercorticism was used.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>One study (Study 1) compared the efficacy of budesonide delayed-release capsules 9 mg daily in the morning to a comparator. At baseline, the median CDAI was 272. Budesonide delayed-release capsules 9 mg daily resulted in a significantly higher clinical improvement rate at Week 8 than the comparator. See Table 5.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 2 and 3) were conducted. Study 2 involved 258 patients and tested the effects of graded doses of budesonide delayed-release capsules (1.5 mg twice daily, 4.5 mg twice daily, or 7.5 mg twice daily) versus placebo. At baseline, the median CDAI was 290. The 1.5 mg twice daily arm (data not shown) could not be differentiated from placebo. The 4.5 mg twice daily arm was statistically different from placebo (Table 5), while no additional benefit was seen when the daily budesonide delayed-release capsules dose was increased to 15 mg per day (data not shown). Study 3 was a 3-armed parallel group study. The groups were treated with budesonide delayed-release capsules 9 mg once daily, budesonide delayed-release capsules 4.5 mg twice daily and placebo for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week double-blind taper phase. The median CDAI at baseline was 263. Neither 9 mg daily nor 4.5 mg twice daily budesonide delayed-release capsules dose levels were statistically different from placebo (Table 5). The recommended dosage of budesonide delayed-release capsules for the treatment of mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon in adults is 9 mg once daily in the morning for up to 8 weeks

                        <paragraph>Two clinical trials (Studies 4 and 5) compared budesonide delayed-release capsules with oral prednisolone (initial dose 40 mg per day). Study 4 was a 3-armed parallel group study. The groups were treated with budesonide delayed-release capsules 9 mg once daily, budesonide delayed-release capsules 4.5 mg twice daily and prednisolone 40 mg (tapered dose) for 8 weeks, followed by a 4-week double blind taper phase. At baseline, the median CDAI was 277. Equal clinical improvement rates (60%) were seen in the budesonide delayed-release capsules 9 mg daily and the prednisolone groups in Study 4. In Study 5, 13% fewer patients in the budesonide delayed-release capsules group experienced clinical improvement than in the prednisolone group (no statistical difference) (Table 5). The proportion of patients with normal plasma cortisol values (greater than 64.58 ng/mL) was significantly higher in the budesonide delayed-release capsules groups in both trials (60% to 66%) than in the prednisolone groups (26% to 28%) at Week 8.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of budesonide delayed-release capsules, in pediatric patients aged 8 to 17 years, who weigh more than 25 kg with mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease (defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 200) involving the ileum and/or the ascending colon, was assessed in one randomized, double-blind, active control study. This study compared budesonide delayed-release capsules 9 mg once daily, with prednisolone, administered at tapering doses starting from 1 mg/kg. Twenty-two (22) patients were treated with budesonide delayed-release capsules capsules and 24 patients were treated with prednisolone. After 8 weeks of treatment, 55% (95% CI: 32%, 77%) of patients treated with budesonide delayed-release capsules reached the endpoint (CDAI ≤150), as compared to 68% (95% CI: 47%, 89%) of patients treated with prednisolone. The average number of liquid or very soft stools per day (assessed over 7 days) decreased from 1.49 at baseline to 0.96 after treatment with budesonide delayed-release capsules and 2.00 at baseline to 0.52 after treatment with prednisolone. The average daily abdominal pain rating (where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe) decreased from 1.49 at baseline to 0.54 after treatment with budesonide delayed-release capsules and 1.64 at baseline to 0.38 after 8 weeks of treatment with prednisolone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use of budesonide delayed-release capsules in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of budesonide delayed-release capsules in adults, and by safety and pharmacokinetic studies performed in pediatric patients.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of budesonide delayed-release capsules for maintenance of clinical remission were evaluated in four double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-month trials in which 380 patients were randomized and treated once daily with 3 mg or 6 mg budesonide delayed-release capsules or placebo. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 73 (mean 37) years. Sixty percent of the patients were female and 99% were Caucasian. The mean CDAI at entry was 96. Among the four clinical trials, approximately 75% of the patients enrolled had exclusively ileal disease. Colonoscopy was not performed following treatment. Budesonide delayed-release capsules 6 mg per day prolonged the time to relapse, defined as an increase in CDAI of at least 60 units to a total score greater than 150 or withdrawal due to disease deterioration. The median time to relapse in the pooled population of the 4 studies was 154 days for patients taking placebo, and 268 days for patients taking budesonide delayed-release capsules 6 mg per day. Budesonide delayed-release capsules 6 mg per day reduced the proportion of patients with loss of symptom control relative to placebo in the pooled population for the 4 studies at 3 months (28% versus 45% for placebo).</paragraph>
