                     <text>
                        <paragraph>FABHALTA, a complement inhibitor, increases a patientâs susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, including <content styleCode="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis</content> (caused by any serogroup, including non-groupable strains), and <content styleCode="italics">Haemophilus influenzae</content> type b. Life-threatening and fatal infections with encapsulated bacteria have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of FABHALTA treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Complete or update vaccination against encapsulated bacteria at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of FABHALTA, according to the current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of therapy with FABHALTA. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent FABHALTA therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with vaccines against encapsulated bacteria according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer these vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including FABHALTA. The benefits and risks of treatment with FABHALTA, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious encapsulated bacterial infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of serious infection and evaluate patients immediately if an infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Serious infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of FABHALTA in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious infections, depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Iptacopan binds to Factor B of the alternative complement pathway and regulates the cleavage of C3, generation of downstream effectors, and the amplification of the terminal pathway.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In PNH, intravascular hemolysis (IVH) is mediated by the downstream membrane attack complex (MAC), while extravascular hemolysis (EVH) is facilitated by C3b opsonization. Iptacopan acts proximally in the alternative pathway of the complement cascade to control both C3b-mediated EVH and terminal complement-mediated IVH.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In IgAN, the deposition of galactose deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) containing immune complexes in the kidney locally activates the alternative complement pathway which is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of IgAN. By binding to Factor B, iptacopan inhibits the alternative pathway.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In C3G, overactivation of the alternative complement pathway leads to C3 cleavage within the glomeruli resulting in C3 deposition and inflammation, which are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of C3G. By binding to Factor B, iptacopan inhibits the alternative pathway.</paragraph>

In treatment naÃ¯ve PNH patients, the mean PNH RBC clone size was 49.1% at baseline and increased to 91.1% after 12 weeks; there were negligible PNH Type II + III RBCs with C3 deposition in this population due to the predominance of IVH.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Iptacopan reduces serum LDH levels. In PNH patients previously treated with eculizumab, all patients treated with FABHALTA 200 mg twice daily achieved a reduction of LDH levels to &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at 13 weeks. In treatment naÃ¯ve PNH patients, FABHALTA 200 mg twice daily reduced LDH by &gt; 60% compared to baseline after 12 weeks and maintained the effect through the end of the study at 2 years.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In C3G patients receiving 200 mg twice daily, the geometric mean serum C3 at baseline was 23 mg/dL and increased to 80 mg/dL at Day 14 of FABHALTA treatment. Over this same period, the placebo group geometric mean serum C3 level decreased from 25 mg/dL to 24 mg/dL. At 6 months the mean glomerular C3 deposition score (0-12) decreased by 0.8 (95% CI: -0.3, 1.8) from a baseline of 9.2 with FABHALTA and increased by 1.1 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.1) from a baseline of 9.6 with placebo. Plasma soluble C5b-9 (also known as MAC) and urine soluble C5b-9 decreased from baseline by 67% and 88%, respectively, at Day 180 of treatment with FABHALTA 200 mg twice daily compared to a 3% decrease in plasma soluble C5b-9 and a 36% decrease in urine soluble C5b-9 in the placebo group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Metabolism is a predominant elimination pathway for iptacopan with approximately 50% of the dose attributed to oxidative pathways. Metabolism of iptacopan includes N-dealkylation, O-deethylation, oxidation, and dehydrogenation, mostly driven by CYP2C8 (98%) with a small contribution from CYP2D6 (2%). Iptacopan undergoes Phase 2 metabolism through glucuronidation by UGT1A1, UGT1A3, and UGT1A8. In plasma, iptacopan was the major component, accounting for 83% of the drug-related species. Two acyl glucuronides were the only metabolites detected in plasma and were minor, accounting for 8% and 5% of the drug-related species. Iptacopan metabolites are not pharmacologically active.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ninety-seven patients were randomized in an 8:5 ratio to switch to FABHALTA 200 mg orally twice daily (n = 62) or to continue anti-C5 treatment (US-approved and non-US-approved eculizumab product n = 23 or US-approved and non-US-approved ravulizumab product n = 12) throughout the duration of the 24-week randomized controlled period. Randomization was stratified based on prior anti-C5 treatment and transfusion history within the last 6 months. Following completion of the 24-week randomized controlled period, all patients were eligible to enroll in a 24-week treatment extension period and receive FABHALTA monotherapy. Subsequently, patients were eligible to enter a separate long-term extension study.</paragraph>

Additional efficacy endpoints included transfusion avoidance, change from baseline in hemoglobin levels and change from baseline in absolute reticulocyte counts.</paragraph>

This study enrolled a total of 40 adults with PNH (RBC clone size â¥ 10%), hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL, and LDH &gt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN). All 40 patients received FABHALTA 200 mg orally twice daily during the 24-week open-label core treatment period. Subsequently, patients were eligible to enroll in a 24-week treatment extension period and continue to receive FABHALTA, followed by a separate long-term extension study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age of the patients was 42.1 years and 42.5% were female. The mean disease duration was 4.7 years. The baseline mean PNH RBC clone size (Type II + III) was 42.7%, mean baseline hemoglobin was 8.2 g/dL, and approximately 70% of patients required a transfusion in the 6 months prior to treatment. The baseline mean LDH level was 1,699 U/L and the mean absolute reticulocyte count was 154 X 10<sup>9</sup>/L. About 13% of patients had a history of MAVEs. No patients discontinued from the core treatment period of the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In total, 77.5% (95% CI: 61.5%, 89.2%) of patients (31/40) achieved a sustained increase (between Day 126 and Day 168) in hemoglobin levels from baseline of â¥ 2 g/dL in the absence of RBC transfusions, based on central laboratory hemoglobin values. In a sensitivity analysis, 87.5% (95% CI: 73.2%, 95.8%) of patients (35/40) achieved a sustained increase (between Day 126 and Day 168) in hemoglobin levels from baseline of â¥ 2 g/dL in the absence of RBC transfusions, including local laboratory hemoglobin values when central laboratory hemoglobin values were not available.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effect of FABHALTA was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study (APPLAUSE-IgAN, NCT04578834) in adults with biopsy-proven IgAN, eGFR â¥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) â¥ 1 g/g on a stable dose of maximally-tolerated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor therapy with or without a stable dose of an SGLT2 inhibitor. Patients with other glomerulopathies or those who had been recently treated with systemic immunosuppressants were excluded. Patients were included in either the Main Study Population (eGFR â¥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or the Severe Renal Impairment population (eGFR â¥ 20 and &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Within each group, patients were randomized (1:1) to either FABHALTA 200 mg or placebo twice daily. Rescue immunosuppressive treatment could be initiated per investigator discretion during the trial.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were required to be vaccinated against <content styleCode="italics">Neisseria meningitidis</content> and <content styleCode="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</content> and were recommended to be vaccinated against <content styleCode="italics">Haemophilus influenzae</content> type b. If the patient had not been previously vaccinated or if a booster was required, vaccination was administered at least 2 weeks prior to first dosing. If FABHALTA treatment was initiated earlier than 2 weeks after vaccination, antibacterial drug prophylaxis was administered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy analysis was based on the first 250 patients with an eGFR â¥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (Main Study Population), who had completed or discontinued the study prior to the Month 9 visit. At baseline, the mean age of these patients was 39 years (range 18 to 74 years); 52% were male, 44% White, 54% Asian, and &lt; 1% Black or African American; the mean eGFR was 64   mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; the geometric mean UPCR (sampled from a 24-hr urine collection) was 2.0 g/g, and 12% had a UPCR â¥ 3.5 g/g. At baseline, 99% of patients were treated with an ACEi or ARB and 13% were on an SGLT2i. Approximately 59% had a history of hypertension, 6% had a history of type 2 diabetes, and 75% had hematuria based on urine dipstick.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the percent reduction in UPCR (sampled from a 24-hr urine collection) at Month 9 relative to baseline (see Table 5). The mean percent change from baseline in UPCR over time is shown in Figure 1.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of FABHALTA in reducing proteinuria in adult patients with native kidney C3G was demonstrated in the APPEAR-C3G trial. Safety and effectiveness of FABHALTA in patients with recurrent C3G following kidney transplant have not been established.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>APPEAR-C3G was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 74 adult patients with biopsy confirmed native kidney C3G who had a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) â¥ 1 g/g and eGFR â¥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (NCT04817618). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either FABHALTA 200 mg orally twice daily (N = 38) or placebo (N = 36) for 6 months, followed by a 6-month open-label treatment period in which all patients received FABHALTA 200 mg orally twice daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were required to be on a maximally tolerated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor and could be on a corticosteroid and/or mycophenolate mofetil/sodium (MMF/MPS) at baseline. All background therapies (i.e., RAS inhibitors, corticosteroids and MMF/MPS) were required to be at stable doses for 90 days prior to randomization and throughout the study. Randomization was stratified according to whether patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were required to be vaccinated against <content styleCode="italics">Neisseria meningitidis</content> and <content styleCode="italics">Streptococcus pneumoniae</content> and were recommended to be vaccinated against <content styleCode="italics">Haemophilus influenzae</content> type b. If the patient had not been previously vaccinated or if a booster was required, vaccination was administered at least 2 weeks prior to first dosing. If FABHALTA treatment was initiated earlier than 2 weeks after vaccination, antibacterial drug prophylaxis was administered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At baseline, the mean age of patients was 28 years (range 18 to 60 years), 64% were male, 69% were White, 24% were Asian, and 9% were Hispanic or Latino. The mean baseline eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was 89 and 99 in the FABHALTA and placebo groups, respectively, and the geometric mean 24-hour UPCR (g/g) at baseline was 3.3 and 2.6 in the FABHALTA and placebo groups, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Twenty four percent of patients in the FABHALTA group and 3% in the placebo group had dense deposit disease. Baseline use of corticosteroids and/or MMF/MPS, and RAS inhibitor was balanced among the FABHALTA and placebo groups. Overall, 45% of patients were on corticosteroids and/or MMF/MPS, and 99% of patients were on a RAS inhibitor at baseline. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was the log-transformed ratio to baseline in UPCR (sampled from a 24-hour urine collection) at 6 months. At 6 months, the geometric mean UPCR ratio relative to baseline was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.85) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.31) in the FABHALTA and placebo groups, respectively, resulting in a 35% reduction in 24-hour UPCR from baseline in the FABHALTA group compared to placebo (p = 0.0028).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following the initial 6-month treatment period, all patients were treated with FABHALTA for an additional 6 months. In patients initially randomized to FABHALTA, the reduction in 24-hour UPCR seen at 6 months was maintained at Month 12. In patients who switched from placebo to FABHALTA, the magnitude of the reduction in 24-hour UPCR from Month 6 to 12 was similar to the reduction seen in patients initially randomized to FABHALTA. The geometric mean percent change from baseline in UPCR (measured as first morning void [FMV]) over time is shown in Figure 2.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Compared to patients treated with placebo, patients treated with FABHALTA had a 7-fold higher odds (p = 0.0166) of achieving a composite renal endpoint defined as a â¥ 50% reduction in 24-hour UPCR compared to baseline and stable or improved eGFR compared to baseline [â¤ 15% reduction in eGFR] at 6 months. Although a greater proportion of patients in the FABHALTA arm (30%) as compared to placebo (6%) achieved a â¥ 50% reduction in 24-hour UPCR compared to baseline, there was no difference between arms in the proportion of patients with stable or improved eGFR compared to baseline at 6 months (90% in FABHALTA vs 89% in placebo). </paragraph>
