                        <paragraph>Administer the diluted ELAPRASE solution to patients using a low-protein-binding infusion set equipped with a low-protein-binding 0.2 micrometer (Âµm) in-line filter.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The total volume of infusion should be administered over a period of 3 hours, which may be gradually reduced to 1 hour if no hypersensitivity reactions are observed. Patients may require longer infusion times if hypersensitivity reactions occur; however, infusion times should not exceed 8 hours. The initial infusion rate should be 8 mL per hour for the first 15 minutes. If the infusion is well tolerated, the rate of infusion may be increased by 8 mL per hour increments every 15 minutes. The infusion rate should not exceed 100 mL per hour. The infusion rate may be slowed, temporarily stopped, or discontinued for that visit in the event of hypersensitivity reactions <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. ELAPRASE should not be infused with other products in the infusion tubing.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>ELAPRASE does not contain preservatives; therefore, after dilution with saline, the infusion bags should be used immediately. If immediate use is not possible, the diluted solution should be stored refrigerated at 2Â°C to 8Â°C (36Â°F to 46 Â°F) for up to 24 hours. Other than during infusion, do not store the diluted ELAPRASE solution at room temperature. Any unused product or waste material should be discarded and disposed of in accordance with local requirements.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred during and up to 24 hours after infusion. Some of these reactions were life-threatening and included respiratory distress, hypoxia, hypotension, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat or tongue, regardless of duration of the course of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If anaphylactic or other acute reactions occur, immediately discontinue the infusion of ELAPRASE and initiate appropriate medical treatment. When severe reactions have occurred during clinical trials, subsequent infusions were managed with antihistamine and/or corticosteroids prior to or during infusions, a slower rate of ELAPRASE infusion, and/or early discontinuation of the ELAPRASE infusion <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6">Adverse Reactions (6)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials with ELAPRASE, 16 of 108 (15%) patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions during 26 of 8,274 infusions (0.3%) that involved adverse events in at least two of the following three body systems: cutaneous, respiratory, or cardiovascular. Of these 16 patients, 11 experienced anaphylactic reactions during 19 of 8,274 infusions (0.2%) with symptoms of bronchospasm, cyanosis, dyspnea, erythema, edema (facial and peripheral), flushing, rash, respiratory distress, urticaria, vomiting, and wheezing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In postmarketing reports, patients receiving ELAPRASE experienced anaphylactic reactions up to several years after initiating treatment. Some patients were reported to have repeated anaphylactic events over a two- to four-month time period. Medical management included treatment with antihistamines, inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, corticosteroids, oxygen, and vasopressors. Treatment was discontinued for some patients, while others continued treatment with premedication and a slower infusion rate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Due to the potential for severe reactions, appropriate medical support should be readily available when ELAPRASE is administered. Observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after administration of ELAPRASE, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in premarketing clinical trials and postmarketing reports. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In the clinical trial of Hunter syndrome patients aged 7 years and younger, patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations experienced a higher incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, serious adverse reactions, and anti-idursulfase antibody development than Hunter syndrome patients with missense mutations. Eleven of 15 (73%) patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations and five of 12 (42%) patients with missense mutations experienced hypersensitivity reactions. Nine of 15 (60%) patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations and two of 12 (17%) patients with missense mutations had serious adverse reactions. All 15 patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations developed anti-idursulfase (ELAPRASE) antibodies, compared to only 3 patients with missense mutations (Table 2). Thirteen patients with these mutations developed neutralizing antibodies, which interfere with ELAPRASE uptake into the cell or ELAPRASE enzyme activity, compared to only one patient with missense mutation <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S6.2">6.2)</linkHtml>, and <linkHtml href="#S8.4">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

Patients experienced similar adverse reactions as those observed in clinical trials in patients 5 years and older, with the most common adverse reactions following ELAPRASE treatment being hypersensitivity reactions (57%). A higher incidence of the following common hypersensitivity reactions were reported in this younger age group: pyrexia (36%), rash (32%), and vomiting (14%). The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients (â¥3 patients) included: bronchopneumonia/pneumonia (18%), ear infection (11%), and pyrexia (11%).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Twenty-seven patients had results of genotype analysis: 15 patients had complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations and 12 patients had missense mutations.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Safety results demonstrated that patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations are more likely to experience hypersensitivity reactions and have serious adverse reactions following ELAPRASE administration, compared to patients with missense mutations.

                              <paragraph>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. In clinical trials in patients 5 years and older, 63 of the 64 patients treated with ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly or placebo for 53 weeks, followed by ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly in the extension trial, had immunogenicity data available for analysis. Of the 63 patients, 32 (51%) patients tested positive for anti-idursulfase IgG antibodies (Ab) at least one time (Table 2). Of the 32 Ab-positive patients, 23 (72%) tested positive for Ab at three or more different time points (persistent Ab). The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was higher in patients who tested positive for Ab than those who tested negative.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Thirteen of 32 (41%) Ab-positive patients also tested positive for antibodies that neutralize idursulfase uptake into cells (uptake neutralizing antibodies, uptake NAb) or enzymatic activity (activity NAb) at least one time, and 8 (25%) of Ab-positive patients had persistent NAb. There was no clear relationship between the presence of either Ab or NAb and therapeutic response.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In the clinical trial in patients 7 years and younger, 19 of 28 (68%) patients treated with ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly tested Ab-positive. Of the 19 Ab-positive patients, 16 (84%) tested positive for Ab at three or more different time points (persistent Ab). In addition, 15 of 19 (79%) Ab-positive patients tested positive for NAb, with 14 of 15 (93%) NAb-positive patients having persistent NAb.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>All 15 patients with complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations tested positive for Ab (Table 2). Of these 15 patients, neutralizing antibodies were observed in 13 (87%) patients. The NAbs in these patients developed earlier (most reported to be positive at Week 9 rather than at Week 27, as reported in clinical trials in patients older than 5 years of age) and were associated with higher titers and greater <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> neutralizing activity than in patients older than 5 years of age. The presence of Ab was associated with reduced systemic idursulfase exposure <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. 										</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to idursulfase in specific assays and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of these assays. The observed incidence of positive antibody in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medication, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to idursulfase with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ELAPRASE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In post-marketing experience, late-emergent symptoms and signs of anaphylactic reactions have occurred up to 24 hours after initial treatment and recovery from an initial anaphylactic reaction. In addition, patients experienced repeated anaphylaxis over a two- to four-month period, up to several years after initiating ELAPRASE treatment <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A seven year-old male patient with Hunter syndrome, who received ELAPRASE at twice the recommended dosage (1 mg/kg weekly) for 1.5 years, experienced two anaphylactic events after 4.5 years of treatment.

                              <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with ELAPRASE use in pregnant women. Available data from a small number of postmarketing cases with ELAPRASE use in pregnancy are insufficient to inform drug-associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In an animal reproduction study, no evidence of adverse effects on pre- and post-natal development was observed with twice weekly intravenous administration of idursulfase to pregnant rats from gestation day 6 through lactation day 19 at about 4 times the recommended human weekly dose of 0.5 mg/kg based on body surface area (<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#DATA1">Data</linkHtml>

                              <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>ELAPRASE is a formulation of idursulfase, a purified form of human iduronate-2-sulfatase, a lysosomal enzyme.  Idursulfase is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a human cell line. Idursulfase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the 2-sulfate esters of terminal iduronate sulfate residues from the glycosaminoglycans dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate in the lysosomes of various cell types.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Idursulfase is a 525-amino acid glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 76 kilodaltons. The enzyme contains eight asparagine-linked glycosylation sites occupied by complex oligosaccharide structures. The enzyme activity of idursulfase is dependent on the post-translational modification of a specific cysteine to formylglycine. Idursulfase has a specific activity ranging from 46 to 74 units/mg of protein (one unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyze 1 micromole of heparin disaccharide substrate per hour under the specified assay conditions).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>ELAPRASE is administered as an intravenous infusion and supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogenic clear to slightly opalescent, colorless solution that must be diluted prior to administration in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  Each vial contains an extractable volume of 3 mL with an idursulfase concentration of 2 mg/mL at a pH of approximately 6. Each vial contains 6 mg idursulfase, sodium chloride (24 mg), sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (6.75 mg), sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate (2.97 mg), and polysorbate 20 (0.66 mg). ELAPRASE does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for single use only.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II, MPS II) is an X-linked recessive disease caused by insufficient levels of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase. This enzyme cleaves the terminal 2-<content styleCode="italics">O</content>-sulfate moieties from the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Due to the missing or defective iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme in patients with Hunter syndrome, GAG progressively accumulate in the lysosomes of a variety of cells, leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, tissue destruction, and organ system dysfunction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ELAPRASE is intended to provide exogenous enzyme for uptake into cellular lysosomes. Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the oligosaccharide chains allow binding of the enzyme to the M6P receptors on the cell surface, leading to cellular internalization of the enzyme, targeting to intracellular lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated GAG.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic characteristics of idursulfase were evaluated in 59 patients with Hunter syndrome. The serum concentration of idursulfase was quantified using an antigen-specific ELISA assay. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in a greater than dose proportional manner as the dose increased from 0.15 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg following a single 1-hour infusion of ELAPRASE. The pharmacokinetic parameters at the recommended dose regimen (0.5 mg/kg ELAPRASE administered weekly as a 3-hour infusion) were determined at Week 1 and Week 27 in 10 patients 7.7 to 27 years of age (Table 3). There were no apparent differences in PK parameter values between Week 1 and Week 27 regardless of the antibody status in these patients.</paragraph>

The presence of anti-idursulfase antibody (Ab) was associated with a reduced systemic exposure of idursulfase. Eight of the 18 Ab-positive patients had no measurable idursulfase concentrations.

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of ELAPRASE were evaluated in a 53-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 96 patients with Hunter syndrome. The trial included patients with deficiency in iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme activity and a percent predicted forced vital capacity (%-predicted FVC) less than 80%. The age of patients ranged from 5 to 31 years. Patients received ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once per week (n=32), ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once every other week (n=32), or placebo (n=32). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy outcome assessment was a two-component composite score based on the sum of the ranks of the change from baseline to Week 53 in distance walked in six minutes (6-minute walk test) and the ranks of the change in %-predicted FVC. This two-component composite primary endpoint differed statistically significantly between the three groups, and the difference was greatest between the placebo group and the once weekly treatment group (once weekly ELAPRASE vs. placebo, p=0.0049).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Examination of the individual components of the composite score showed that, in the adjusted analysis, the weekly ELAPRASE-treated group experienced a 35 meter greater mean increase in the distance walked in six minutes compared to placebo. The changes in %-predicted FVC were not statistically significant (Table 5).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pharmacodynamic assessments included urinary GAG levels and changes in liver and spleen size. Urinary GAG levels were elevated in all patients at baseline. Following 53 weeks of treatment, mean urinary GAG levels were reduced in the ELAPRASE once weekly group, although GAG levels still remained above the upper limit of normal in half of the ELAPRASE-treated patients. Urinary GAG levels remained elevated and essentially unchanged in the placebo group. Sustained reductions in both liver and spleen volumes were observed in the ELAPRASE once weekly group through Week 53 compared to placebo. There were essentially no changes in liver and spleen volumes in the placebo group.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Patients who participated in the placebo-controlled trial were eligible to continue treatment in an open-label extension trial. During the extension trial, all patients received ELAPRASE 0.5mg/kg once weekly for 24 months. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients who were treated with ELAPRASE once weekly and every other week in the placebo-controlled trial demonstrated improvement in distance walked in the 6-minute walk test for an additional 8 months of treatment in the extension trial. There was no change in mean %-predicted FVC in all Hunter syndrome patients after 6 months of treatment in the extension trial; however, a slight decrease in mean %-predicted FVC was demonstrated through to month 24 of the extension trial. The long-term effect of ELAPRASE on pulmonary function in Hunter syndrome patients is unclear.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>There were no further reductions in mean urinary GAG levels in patients initially treated with ELAPRASE once weekly; however, the patients treated with ELAPRASE every other week during the placebo-controlled trial experienced further reductions in mean urinary GAG levels after changing to a more frequent dosing regimen during the extension trial. The persistence of reduced urinary GAG levels did not correlate with the long term effect demonstrated by the 6-minute walk test distance or %-predicted FVC.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 53-week, open-label, multicenter, single-arm trial was conducted to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ELAPRASE 0.5 mg/kg once weekly in male Hunter syndrome patients aged 7 years and younger. Safety results demonstrated that patients with complete gene deletion or large gene rearrangement mutations are more likely to develop antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, and to experience hypersensitivity reactions with ELAPRASE administration <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S6.2">6.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. In patients who remained antibody negative, the pharmacokinetic profile, reduction in urinary GAG excretion levels, and reduction in spleen volume were similar to those of adults and children 5 years and older. In patients who were persistently antibody positive, the presence of anti-idursulfase antibody was associated with reduced systemic exposure of idursulfase and a less pronounced decrease in urinary GAG levels <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S12.3">12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
