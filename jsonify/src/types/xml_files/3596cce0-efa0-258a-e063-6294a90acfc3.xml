                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel, 1.62%

Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Testosterone gel, 1.62% was evaluated in a two-phase, 364-day, controlled clinical study. The first phase was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled period of 182 days, in which 234 hypogonadal men were treated with testosterone gel, 1.62% and 40 received placebo. Patients could continue in an open-label, non-comparative, maintenance period for an additional 182 days

                        <paragraph>The most common adverse reaction reported in the double-blind period was increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) reported in 26 testosterone gel, 1.62%-treated patients (11.1%). In 17 patients, increased PSA was considered an adverse event by meeting one of the two pre-specified criteria for abnormal PSA values, defined as (1) average serum PSA &gt;4 ng/mL based on two separate determinations, or (2) an average change from baseline in serum PSA of greater than 0.75 ng/mL on two determinations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the 182-day, double-blind period of the clinical trial, the mean change in serum PSA value was 0.14 ng/mL for patients receiving testosterone gel, 1.62% and -0.12 ng/mL for the patients in the placebo group. During the double-blind period, seven patients had a PSA value &gt;4.0 ng/mL, four of these seven patients had PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeat testing. The other three patients did not undergo repeat PSA testing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the 182-day, open-label period of the study, the mean change in serum PSA values was 0.10 ng/mL for both patients continuing on active therapy and patients transitioning onto active from placebo. During the open-label period, three patients had a serum PSA value &gt; 4.0 ng/mL, two of whom had a serum PSA less than or equal to 4.0 ng/mL upon repeated testing. The other patient did not undergo repeat PSA testing. Among previous placebo patients, 3 of 28 (10.7%), had increased PSA as an adverse event in the open-label period.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least one reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user's shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets

                        <paragraph>Testosterone gel, 1.62% is contraindicated pregnant women. Testosterone is teratogenic and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnanat woman based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (
  
   <linkHtml href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS">4</linkHtml>) and Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   <linkHtml href="#MECHANISM_OF_ACTION">12.1</linkHtml>)]
 
  </content>.Exposure of a female fetus to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization. In animal developmental studies, exposure to testosterone in utero resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring and structural impairments of reproductive tissues in femail and male offspring. These studies did not meet current standards for nonclinical develpment toxicity studies.

                        <paragraph>In developmental studies conducted in rats, rabbits, pigs, sheep and rhesus monkeys, pregnant animals received intramuscular injection of testosterone during the period of organogenesis. Testosterone treatment at doses that were comparable to those used for testosterone replacement therapy resulted in structural impairments in both female and male offspring. Structural impairments observed in females included increased ano-genital distance, phallus development, empty scrotum, no external vagina, intrauterine growth retardation, reduced ovarian reserve, and increased ovarian follicular recruitment. Structural impairments seen in male offspring included increased testicular weight, larger seminal tubular lumen diameter, and higher frequency of occluded tubule lumen. Increased pituitary weight was seen in both sexes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Testosterone exposure in utero also resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring. Hypertension was observed in pregnant female rats and their offspring exposed to doses approximately twice those used for testosterone replacement therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Drug abuse is intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological and physiological effects. Abuse and misuse of testosterone are seen in male and female adults and adolescents. Testosterone, often in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), and not obtained by prescription through a pharmacy, may be abused by athletes and bodybuilders. There have been reports of misuse by men taking higher doses of legally obtained testosterone than prescribed and continuing testosterone despite adverse events or against medical advice.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have also been reported in men: transient ischemic attacks, convulsions, hypomania, irritability, dyslipidemias, testicular atrophy, subfertility, and infertility.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in women: hirsutism, virilization, deepening of voice, clitoral enlargement, breast atrophy, male-pattern baldness, and menstrual irregularities.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have been reported in male and female adolescents: premature closure of bony epiphyses with termination of growth, and precocious puberty.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and may include abuse of other agents, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement; vocal chord thickening; and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter's syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH).</paragraph>

About 90% of a dose of testosterone given intramuscularly is excreted in the urine as glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites. About 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The potential for testosterone transfer following administration of testosterone gel, 1.62% when it was applied only to upper arms/shoulders was evaluated in two clinical studies of males dosed with testosterone gel, 1.62% and their untreated female partners. In one study, 8 male subjects applied a single dose of testosterone gel, 1.62% 81 mg to their shoulders and upper arms. Two (2) hours after application, female subjects rubbed their hands, wrists, arms, and shoulders to the application site of the male subjects for 15 minutes. Serum concentrations of testosterone were monitored in female subjects for 24 hours after contact occurred. After direct skin-to-skin contact with the site of application, mean testosterone C
 
  <sub>avg</sub>and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>in female subjects increased by 280% and 267%, respectively, compared to mean baseline testosterone concentrations. In a second study evaluating transfer of testosterone, 12 male subjects applied a single dose of testosterone gel, 1.62% 81 mg to their shoulders and upper arms. Two (2) hours after application, female subjects rubbed their hands, wrists, arms, and shoulders to the application site of the male subjects for 15 minutes while the site of application was covered by a t-shirt. When a t-shirt was used to cover the site of application, mean testosterone C
 
  <sub>avg</sub>and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>in female subjects increased by 6% and 11%, respectively, compared to mean baseline testosterone concentrations.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A separate study was conducted to evaluate the potential for testosterone transfer from 16 males dosed with testosterone gel, 1.62% 81 mg when it was applied to abdomen only for 7 days, a site of application not approved for testosterone gel, 1.62%. Two (2) hours after application to the males on each day, the female subjects rubbed their abdomens for 15 minutes to the abdomen of the males. The males had covered the application area with a T-shirt. The mean testosterone C
 
  <sub>avg</sub>and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>in female subjects on day 1 increased by 43% and 47%, respectively, compared to mean baseline testosterone concentrations. The mean testosterone C
 
  <sub>avg</sub>and C

                        <paragraph>In a randomized, 3-way (3 treatment periods without washout period) crossover study in 24 hypogonadal men, the effect of showering on testosterone exposure was assessed after once daily application of testosterone gel, 1.62% 81 mg to upper arms/shoulders for 7 days in each treatment period. On the 7th day of each treatment period, hypogonadal men took a shower with soap and water at either 2, 6, or 10 hours after drug application. The effect of showering at 2 or 6 hours post-dose on Day 7 resulted in 13% and 12% decreases in mean C
 
  <sub>avg</sub>, respectively, compared to Day 6 when no shower was taken after drug application. Showering at 10 hours after drug application had no effect on bioavailability. The amount of testosterone remaining in the outer layers of the skin at the application site on the 7th day was assessed using a tape stripping procedure and was reduced by at least 80% after showering 2-10 hours post-dose compared to on the 6th day when no shower was taken after drug application.

                        <paragraph>In a randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover study in 16 healthy male subjects, the effect of hand washing on the amount of residual testosterone on the hands was evaluated. Subjects used their hands to apply the maximum dose (81 mg testosterone) of testosterone gel, 1.62% to their upper arms and shoulders. Within 1 minute of applying the gel, subjects either washed or did not wash their hands prior to study personnel wiping the subjects‚Äô hands with ethanol dampened gauze pads. The gauze pads were then analyzed for residual testosterone content. A mean (SD) of 0.1 (0.04) mg of residual testosterone (0.12% of the actual applied dose of testosterone, and a 96% reduction compared to when hands were not washed) was recovered after washing hands with water and soap.</paragraph>

For 7 days, moisturizing lotion or sunscreen (SPF 50) was applied daily to the testosterone gel, 1.62% application site 1 hour after the application of testosterone gel, 1.62% 40.5 mg. Application of moisturizing lotion increased mean testosterone C

                        <paragraph>Testosterone gel, 1.62% was evaluated in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (182-day double-blind period) in 274 hypogonadal men with body mass index (BMI) 18-40 kg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>and 18-80 years of age (mean age 53.8 years). The patients had an average serum testosterone concentration of &lt;300 ng/dL, as determined by two morning samples collected on the same visit. Patients were Caucasian 83%, Black 13%, Asian or Native American 4%. 7.5% of patients were Hispanic.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were randomized to receive active treatment or placebo using a rotation method utilizing the abdomen and upper arms/shoulders for 182 days. All patients were started at a daily dose of 40.5 mg (two pump actuations) testosterone gel, 1.62% or matching placebo on Day 1 of the study. Patients returned to the clinic on Day 14, Day 28, and Day 42 for predose serum total testosterone assessments. The patient's daily dose was titrated up or down in 20.25 mg increments if the predose serum testosterone value was outside the range of 350-750 ng/dL. The study included four active testosterone gel, 1.62% doses: 20.25 mg, 40.5 mg, 60.75 mg, and 81 mg daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with C
 
  <sub>avg</sub>within the normal range of 300-1000 ng/dL on Day 112. In patients treated with testosterone gel, 1.62%, 81.6% (146/179) had C
 
  <sub>avg</sub>within the normal range at Day 112. The secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients, with C
 
  <sub>max</sub>above three pre-determined limits. The percentages of patients with C
 
  <sub>max</sub>greater than 1500 ng/dL, and between 1800 and 2499 ng/dL on Day 112 were 11.2% and 5.5%, respectively. Two patients had a C
 
  <sub>max</sub>&gt;2500 ng/dL on Day 112 (2510 ng/dL and 2550 ng/dL, respectively); neither of these 2 patients demonstrated an abnormal C
 
  <sub>max</sub>on prior or subsequent assessments at the same dose.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients could agree to continue in an open-label, active treatment maintenance period of the study for an additional 182 days.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dose titrations on Days 14, 28, and 42 resulted in final doses of 20.25 mg ‚Äì 81 mg on Day 112 as shown in
