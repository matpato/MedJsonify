                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have been observed with OFEV treatment. In the clinical trials and postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of DILI were reported.  Cases of severe liver injury with fatal outcome have been reported in the postmarketing period. The majority of hepatic events occur within the first three months of treatment. In clinical trials, administration of OFEV was associated with elevations of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALKP, GGT) and bilirubin. Liver enzyme and bilirubin increases were reversible with dose modification or interruption in the majority of cases. In IPF studies (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), the majority (94%) of patients with ALT and/or AST elevations had elevations less than 5 times ULN and the majority (95%) of patients with bilirubin elevations had elevations less than 2 times ULN. In the chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype study (Study 5), the majority (95%) of patients with ALT and/or AST elevations had elevations less than 5 times ULN and the majority (94%) of patients with bilirubin elevations had elevations less than 2 times ULN. In the SSc-ILD study (Study 4), a maximum ALT and/or AST greater than or equal to 3 times ULN was observed for 4.9% of patients in the OFEV group and for 0.7% of patients in the placebo group  <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S8.6">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. Patients with a low body weight (less than 65 kg), Asian, and female patients may have a higher risk of elevations in liver enzymes. Nintedanib exposure increased with patient age, which may also result in a higher risk of increased liver enzymes <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, OFEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Nintedanib caused embryo-fetal deaths and structural abnormalities in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis at less than (rats) and approximately 5 times (rabbits) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in adults. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with OFEV and to use highly effective contraception at initiation of, during treatment, and at least 3 months after the last dose of OFEV. Nintedanib does not change the exposure to oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel in patients with SSc-ILD. However, the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives may be compromised by vomiting and/or diarrhea or other conditions where the drug absorption may be reduced. Advise women taking oral hormonal contraceptives experiencing these conditions to use alternative highly effective contraception. Verify pregnancy status prior to treatment with OFEV and during treatment as appropriate <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S8.1">Use in Specific Populations (8.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S8.3">8.3)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#S12.1">Clinical Pharmacology (12.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S12.3">12.3)</linkHtml>].</content>

                        <paragraph>Arterial thromboembolic events have been reported in patients taking OFEV. In IPF studies (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with OFEV and less than 1% of placebo-treated patients. Myocardial infarction was the most common adverse reaction under arterial thromboembolic events, occurring in 1.5% of OFEV-treated patients compared to less than 1% of placebo-treated patients. In the chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype study (Study 5), arterial thromboembolic events were reported in less than 1% of patients in both treatment arms. Myocardial infarction was observed in less than 1% of patients in both treatment arms. In the SSc-ILD study (Study 4), arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 0.7% of patients in both treatment arms.

                                    <paragraph>In animal reproduction toxicity studies, nintedanib caused embryo-fetal deaths and structural abnormalities in rats and rabbits at less than and approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in adults (on a plasma AUC basis at maternal oral doses of 2.5 and 15 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively). Malformations included abnormalities in the vasculature, urogenital, and skeletal systems. Vasculature anomalies included missing or additional major blood vessels. Skeletal anomalies included abnormalities in the thoracic, lumbar, and caudal vertebrae (e.g., hemivertebra, missing, or asymmetrically ossified), ribs (bifid or fused), and sternebrae (fused, split, or unilaterally ossified). In some fetuses, organs in the urogenital system were missing. In rabbits, a significant change in sex ratio was observed in fetuses (female:male ratio of approximately 71%:29%) at approximately 15 times the MRHD in adults (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day). Nintedanib decreased post-natal viability of rat pups during the first 4 post-natal days when dams were exposed to less than the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>

Nintedanib does not change the exposure to oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel in patients with SSc-ILD. However, the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives may be compromised by vomiting and/or diarrhea or other conditions where the drug absorption may be reduced.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Nintedanib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs). Nintedanib inhibits the following RTKs: platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) Î± and Î², fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT-3). These kinases except for FLT-3 have been implicated in pathogenesis of interstitial lung diseases (ILD). Nintedanib binds competitively to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of these kinases and blocks the intracellular signaling cascades, which have been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic tissue remodeling in ILD. Nintedanib also inhibits the following nRTKs: Lck, Lyn and Src kinases.  The contribution of FLT-3 and nRTK inhibition to nintedanib efficacy in ILD is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The PK properties of nintedanib were similar in healthy volunteers, patients with IPF, patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype, patients with SSc-ILD, and cancer patients. The PK of nintedanib is linear. Dose proportionality was shown by an increase of nintedanib exposure with increasing doses (dose range 50 to 450 mg once daily and 150 to 300 mg twice daily). Accumulation upon multiple administrations in patients with IPF was 1.76-fold for AUC. Steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved within one week of dosing. Nintedanib trough concentrations remained stable for more than one year. The inter-individual variability in the PK of nintedanib was moderate to high (coefficient of variation of standard PK parameters in the range of 30% to 70%), intra-individual variability low to moderate (coefficients of variation below 40%).</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>The prevalent metabolic reaction for nintedanib is hydrolytic cleavage by esterases resulting in the free acid moiety BIBF 1202. BIBF 1202 is subsequently glucuronidated by UGT enzymes, namely UGT 1A1, UGT 1A7, UGT 1A8, and UGT 1A10 to BIBF 1202 glucuronide. Only a minor extent of the biotransformation of nintedanib consisted of CYP pathways, with CYP3A4 being the predominant enzyme involved. The major CYP-dependent metabolite could not be detected in plasma in the human absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination study. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>, CYP-dependent metabolism accounted for about 5% compared to about 25% ester cleavage.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp and, to a minor extent, CYP3A4. Coadministration with the P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, increased exposure to nintedanib 1.61-fold based on AUC and 1.83-fold based on C<sub>max</sub> in a dedicated drug-drug interaction study. In a drug-drug interaction study with the P-gp and CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, exposure to nintedanib decreased to 50.3% based on AUC and to 60.3% based on C<sub>max</sub> upon coadministration with rifampicin compared to administration of nintedanib alone.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Effect of pirfenidone coadministration on nintedanib AUC and C<sub>max</sub> was evaluated in a multiple-dose drug-drug interaction study. Pirfenidone did not have an effect on the exposure of nintedanib.

Similar nintedanib trough plasma concentrations were observed when comparing patients receiving nintedanib alone with patients receiving nintedanib with add-on pirfenidone.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Healthy volunteers received a single dose of 150 mg nintedanib before and after multiple dosing of 125 mg bosentan twice daily at steady state. Coadministration of nintedanib with bosentan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies of nintedanib in rats and mice have not revealed any evidence of carcinogenic potential. Nintedanib was dosed up to 10 and 30 mg/kg/day in rats and mice, respectively. These doses were less than and approximately 4 times the MRHD on a plasma drug AUC basis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Nintedanib was negative for genotoxicity in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> bacterial reverse mutation assay, the mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay, and the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> rat micronucleus assay.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In rats, nintedanib reduced female fertility at exposure levels approximately 3 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day). Effects included increases in resorption and post-implantation loss, and a decrease in gestation index. Changes in the number and size of corpora lutea in the ovaries were observed in chronic toxicity studies in rats and mice. An increase in the number of females with resorptions only was observed at exposures approximately equal to the MRHD (on an AUC basis at an oral dose of 20 mg/kg/day). Nintedanib had no effects on male fertility in rats at exposure levels approximately 3 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The clinical efficacy of OFEV has been studied in 1231 patients with IPF in one phase 2 (Study 1 [NCT00514683]) and two phase 3 studies (Study 2 [NCT01335464] and Study 3 [NCT01335477]). These were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies comparing treatment with OFEV 150 mg twice daily to placebo for 52 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study 2 and Study 3 were identical in design. Study 1 was very similar in design. Patients were randomized in a 3:2 ratio (1:1 for Study 1) to either OFEV 150 mg or placebo twice daily for 52 weeks. Study 1 also included other treatment arms (50 mg daily, 50 mg twice daily, and 100 mg twice daily) that are not further discussed. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Time to first acute IPF exacerbation was a key secondary endpoint in Study 2 and Study 3 and a secondary endpoint in Study 1. Change from baseline in FVC percent predicted and survival were additional secondary endpoints in all studies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were required to have a diagnosis of IPF (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT criteria) for less than 5 years. Diagnoses were centrally adjudicated based on radiologic and, if applicable, histopathologic confirmation. Patients were required to be greater than or equal to 40 years of age with an FVC greater than or equal to 50% of predicted and a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO, corrected for hemoglobin) 30% to 79% of predicted. Patients with relevant airways obstruction (i.e., pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC less than 0.7) or, in the opinion of the investigator, likely to receive a lung transplant during the studies were excluded (being listed for lung transplant was acceptable for inclusion). Patients with greater than 1.5 times ULN of ALT, AST, or bilirubin, patients with a known risk or predisposition to bleeding, patients receiving a full dose of anticoagulation treatment, and patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded from the studies. Patients were also excluded if they received other investigational therapy, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or cyclosporine A within 8 weeks of entry into this trial, or n-acetyl cysteine and prednisone (greater than 15 mg/day or equivalent) within 2 weeks. The majority of patients were Caucasian (60%) or Asian (30%) and male (79%). Patients had a mean age of 67 years and a mean FVC percent predicted of 80%.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>A statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of decline of FVC (in mL) was demonstrated in patients receiving OFEV compared to patients receiving placebo based on the random coefficient regression model, adjusted for gender, height, and age. The treatment effect on FVC was consistent in all 3 studies. See <linkHtml href="#Table3">Table 3</linkHtml> for individual study results.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Acute IPF exacerbation was defined as unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea within 30 days, new diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, and/or new high-resolution CT parenchymal abnormalities with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion, and exclusion of alternative causes. Acute IPF exacerbation was adjudicated in Study 2 and Study 3. In Study 1 (investigator-reported) and Study 3 (adjudicated), the risk of first acute IPF exacerbation over 52 weeks was significantly reduced in patients receiving OFEV compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.71) and (HR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.56), respectively. In Study 2 (adjudicated), there was no difference between the treatment groups (HR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.20, 1.54).</paragraph>

                     <title>14.2  Chronic Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases with a Progressive Phenotype</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The clinical efficacy of OFEV has been studied in patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study 5 [NCT02999178]). A total of 663 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OFEV 150 mg twice daily or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks. Randomization was stratified based on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) fibrotic pattern as assessed by central readers: 412 patients with UIP-like HRCT pattern and 251 patients with other HRCT fibrotic patterns were randomized. There were 2 co-primary populations defined for the analyses in this trial: all patients (the overall population) and patients with HRCT with UIP-like HRCT fibrotic pattern. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks. Other endpoints included time to first acute ILD exacerbation and time to death. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with a clinical diagnosis of a chronic fibrosing ILD were selected if they had relevant fibrosis (greater than 10% fibrotic features) on HRCT and presented with clinical signs of progression (defined as FVC decline â¥10%, FVC decline â¥5% and &lt;10% with worsening symptoms or imaging, or worsening symptoms and worsening imaging all in the 24 months prior to screening). Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 45% of predicted and a DLCO 30% to less than 80% of predicted. Patients were required to have progressed despite management deemed appropriate in clinical practice by investigators for the patient's relevant ILD. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with IPF, relevant airways obstruction (i.e., pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC less than 0.7), or significant pulmonary hypertension were excluded from the trial. Patients with greater than 1.5 times ULN of ALT, AST, or bilirubin, patients with a known risk or predisposition to bleeding, patients receiving a full dose of anticoagulation treatment, and patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they received other investigational therapy, azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, oral corticosteroids greater than 20 mg/day, or the combination of oral corticosteroids + azathioprine + n-acetylcysteine within 4 weeks of randomization, cyclophosphamide within 8 weeks prior to randomization, rituximab within 6 months, or previous treatment with nintedanib or pirfenidone. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The majority of patients were Caucasian (74%) or Asian (25%). Patients were mostly male (54%) and had a mean age of 66 years and a mean FVC percent predicted of 69%, and 49% were never-smokers. The underlying clinical ILD diagnoses in groups represented in the trial were hypersensitivity pneumonitis (26%), autoimmune ILDs (26%), idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (19%), unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (17%), and other ILDs (12%).</paragraph>

The annual rate of decline in FVC (in mL) over 52 weeks was significantly reduced by 107 mL in patients receiving OFEV compared to patients receiving placebo.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The clinical efficacy of nintedanib has been studied in patients with SSc-ILD in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study 4 [NCT02597933]). A total of 580 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OFEV 150 mg twice daily or matching placebo for at least 52 weeks, of which 576 patients were treated. Randomization was stratified by anti-topoisomerase antibody (ATA) status. Individual patients remained on blinded trial treatment for up to 100 weeks. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of decline in FVC over 52 weeks. The absolute change from baseline in the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) at Week 52 was a key secondary endpoint. Mortality over the whole trial was an additional secondary endpoint.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were diagnosed with SSc-ILD based upon the 2013 American College of Rheumatology / European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for SSc with onset of disease (first non-Raynaud symptom) of less than 7 years and greater than or equal to 10% fibrosis on a chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan conducted within the previous 12 months. Patients were required to have an FVC greater than or equal to 40% of predicted and a DLCO 30-89% of predicted. Patients with relevant airways obstruction (i.e., pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC less than 0.7) or previous or planned hematopoietic stem cell transplant were excluded from the trial. Patients with greater than 1.5 times ULN of ALT, AST, or bilirubin, patients with a known risk or predisposition to bleeding, patients receiving a full dose of anticoagulation treatment, and patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or stroke were excluded from the study. Patients were excluded if they had significant pulmonary hypertension, more than three digital fingertip ulcers, a history of severe digital necrosis requiring hospitalization, or a history of scleroderma renal crisis. Patients were also excluded if they received other investigational therapy, azathioprine within 8 weeks prior to randomization, cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine A within 6 months prior to randomization, or previous treatment with nintedanib or pirfenidone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The majority of patients were female (75%). Patients were mostly Caucasian (67%), Asian (25%), or Black (6%). The mean age was 54 years. Overall, 52% of patients had diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc) and 48% had limited cutaneous SSc. The mean time since first onset of a non-Raynaud symptom was 3.49 years. At baseline, 49% of patients were on stable therapy with mycophenolate.</paragraph>
