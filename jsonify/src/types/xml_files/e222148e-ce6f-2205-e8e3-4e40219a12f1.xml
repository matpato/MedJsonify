                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDS. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see<content styleCode="bold"/>

In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years after follow-up.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy was usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph> Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs and PPIs such as those contained in naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately [see also Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#_e7ef79f8-ff4d-89bb-3d1a-b396e6db11a0">5.9</linkHtml>)].  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Use of NSAIDs, including naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets treatment is needed in a pregnant woman. Discontinue naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [see Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#_faca12af-33ef-29c2-0a9a-3dc7860b0b98">8.1</linkHtml>)]. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including esomeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.     <br/>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy inpatients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.     </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> SLE is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.    </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, discontinue drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole, a component of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, consider alternative anti-platelet therapy [see <content styleCode="italics">Drug Interactions</content>

                        <paragraph> Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions <linkHtml href="#_daad72f3-c239-7e36-0b6a-dd67d5c83fa2">(6.2)</linkHtml>]. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see <content styleCode="italics">Drug Interactions</content>

                        <paragraph>Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.

                        <paragraph>The safety of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets was evaluated in clinical studies involving 2,317 patients (aged 27 to 90 years) and ranging from 3 to 12 months. Patients received either 500 mg/20 mg of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets twice daily (n=1,157), 500 mg of enteric-coated naproxen twice daily (n=426), or placebo (n=246). The average number of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets doses taken over 12 months was 696±44.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The table below lists all adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in &gt;2% of patients receiving naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets and higher in the naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium group than control  from two clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2). Both of these studies were randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel studies. The majority of patients were female (67%), white (86%). The majority of patients were 50 to 69 years of age (83%). Approximately one quarter were on low-dose aspirin.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In Study 1 and Study 2, patients taking naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets had fewer premature discontinuations due to adverse reactions compared to patients taking enteric-coated naproxen alone (7.9% vs. 12.5% respectively). The most common reasons for discontinuations due to adverse events in the naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets treatment group were upper abdominal pain (1.2%, n=5), duodenal ulcer (0.7%, n=3) and erosive gastritis (0.7%, n=3). Among patients receiving enteric-coated naproxen, the most common reasons for discontinuations due to adverse events were duodenal ulcer 5.4% (n=23), dyspepsia 2.8% (n=12) and upper abdominal pain 1.2% (n=5). The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to any upper gastrointestinal adverse events (including duodenal ulcers) in patients treated with naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets was 4% compared to 12% for patients taking enteric-coated naproxen.</paragraph>

                              <br/>• Naproxen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of naproxen and anticoagulants have increased the risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. <br/>• Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone. <br/>

Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. <br/>•Concomitant use of esomeprazole 40 mg resulted in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see <content styleCode="italics">Clinical Pharmacology</content>

                              <linkHtml href="#PHARMACODYNAMICS">(12.2)</linkHtml>]. There is reason to expect that the interaction would be present with prescription doses of naproxen or with enteric-coated low-dose aspirin; however, the peak interference with aspirin function may be later than observed in the PD study due to the longer washout period.<br/> Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions</content>

                        <paragraph> Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, naproxen administered during organogenesis to rats and rabbits at doses less than the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1,500 mg/day showed no evidence of harm to the fetus <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as naproxen resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss.   </paragraph>

However, available epidemiologic data for omeprazole (esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole) fail to demonstrate an increased risk of major congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with first trimester omeprazole use <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. In animal studies with administration of oral esomeprazole magnesium in rats changes in bone morphology were observed in offspring of rats dosed through most of pregnancy and lactation at doses equal to or greater than approximately 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole.

                        <paragraph>Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Four epidemiological studies compared the frequency of congenital abnormalities among infants born to women who used omeprazole during pregnancy with the frequency of abnormalities among infants of women exposed to H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists or other controls. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A population-based retrospective cohort epidemiological study from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, covering approximately 99% of pregnancies, from 1995 to 99, reported on 955 infants (824 exposed during the first trimester with 39 of these exposed beyond first trimester, and 131 exposed after the first trimester) whose mothers used omeprazole during pregnancy. The number of infants exposed <content styleCode="italics">in utero</content> to omeprazole that had any malformation, low birth weight, low Apgar score, or hospitalization was similar to the number observed in this population. The number of infants born with ventricular septal defects and the number of stillborn infants was slightly higher in the omeprazole- exposed infants than the expected number in this population.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2009, reported on 1,800 live births whose mothers used omeprazole during the first trimester of pregnancy and 837, 317 live births whose mothers did not use any proton pump inhibitor. The overall rate of birth defects in infants born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole was 2.9% and 2.6% in infants born to mothers not exposed to any proton pump inhibitor during the first trimester.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A retrospective cohort study reported on 689 pregnant women exposed to either H<sub>2</sub>-blockers or omeprazole in the first trimester (134 exposed to omeprazole) and 1,572 pregnant women unexposed to either during the first trimester. The overall malformation rate in offspring born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole, an H<sub>2</sub>- blocker, or were unexposed was 3.6%, 5.5%, and 4.1% respectively. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A small prospective observational cohort study followed 113 women exposed to omeprazole during pregnancy (89% first trimester exposures). The reported rate of major congenital malformations was 4% in the omeprazole group, 2% in controls exposed to non-teratogens, and 2.8% in disease-paired controls. Rates of spontaneous and elective abortions, preterm deliveries, gestational age at delivery, and mean birth weight were similar among the groups.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Several studies have reported no apparent adverse short-term effects on the infant when single dose oral or intravenous omeprazole was administered to over 200 pregnant women as premedication for cesarean section under general anesthesia.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in reproduction studies with esomeprazole magnesium in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) or in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 42 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis) administered during organogenesis and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to esomeprazole magnesium.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development were performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 68 times a daily human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Neonatal/early postnatal (birth to weaning) survival was decreased at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Body weight and body weight gain were reduced and neurobehavioral or general developmental delays in the immediate post-weaning timeframe were evident at doses equal to or greater than 69 mg /kg/day (about 17 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). In addition, decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses equal to or greater than 14 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 times a daily human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). Physeal dysplasia in the femur was observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of esomeprazole magnesium at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times the daily human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in the pre- and postnatal toxicity study when esomeprazole magnesium was administered at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg /kg/day (about 3.4 to 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis).  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A pre- and postnatal development study in rats with esomeprazole strontium (using equimolar doses compared to esomeprazole magnesium study) produced similar results in dams and pups as described above. A follow up developmental toxicity study in rats with further time points to evaluate pup bone development from postnatal day 2 to adulthood was performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) where esomeprazole administration was from either gestational day 7 or gestational day 16 until parturition. When maternal administration was confined to gestation only, there were no effects on bone physeal morphology in the offspring at any age.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Limited data from published literature report that naproxen anion has been found in the milk of lactating women at a concentration equivalent to approximately 1% of maximum naproxen concentration in plasma. Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole and limited data from published literature suggest omeprazole may be present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of naproxen or omeprazole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</paragraph>

Use of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in this age group is based on extrapolation of adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and supported by a 6 month safety study including pharmacokinetic assessment of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium in 36 adolescent patients with JIA. Based on the limited data, the plasma naproxen and plasma esomeprazole concentrations were found to be within the range to that observed to those found in healthy adults. The safety profile of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in adolescent patients with JIA was similar to adults with RA. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Naproxen and its metabolites are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma have occurred but were rare [see <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions</content> (<linkHtml href="#_61b5385f-c0f4-be2e-03bb-0bb4039ffa69">5.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#_fe003eda-1f84-b042-28cf-6a778271e077">5.2</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#_5a8f7d17-39af-653b-79ec-55ded1c93db6">5.4</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#_3a3cfb02-f31c-cf5c-430a-8d63fbfc0ab8">5.6</linkHtml>)]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A few patients have experienced seizures, but it is not clear whether or not these were drug-related. It is not known what dose of the drug would be life threatening. The oral LD50 of the drug is 500 mg/kg in rats, 1,200 mg/kg in mice, 4,000 mg/kg in hamsters and greater than 1,000 mg/kg in dogs. In animals 0.5 g/kg of activated charcoal was effective in reducing plasma levels of naproxen.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Hemodialysis does not decrease the plasma concentration of naproxen because of the high degree of its protein binding. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>A single oral dose of esomeprazole at 510 mg/kg (about 124 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) was lethal to rats. The major signs of acute toxicity were reduced motor activity, changes in respiratory frequency, tremor, ataxia, and intermittent clonic convulsions. The symptoms described in connection with deliberate esomeprazole overdose (limited experience of doses in excess of 240 mg/day) are transient. Single doses of 80 mg of esomeprazole were uneventful. Reports of overdosage with omeprazole in humans may also be relevant. Doses ranged up to 2,400 mg (120 times the usual recommended clinical dose). Manifestations were variable, but included confusion, drowsiness, blurred vision, tachycardia, nausea, diaphoresis, flushing, headache, dry mouth, and other adverse reactions similar to those seen in normal clinical experience (see omeprazole package insert - Adverse Reactions). No specific antidote for esomeprazole is known. Since esomeprazole is extensively protein bound, it is not expected to be removed by dialysis. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.   </paragraph>

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets consists of an immediate-release esomeprazole magnesium layer and an enteric-coated naproxen core. As a result, esomeprazole is released first in the stomach, prior to the dissolution of naproxen in the small intestine. The enteric coating prevents naproxen release at pH levels below 5.5.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action of the naproxen anion, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties contributed by the naproxen component. Naproxen is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis<content styleCode="italics"> in vitro</content>. Naproxen concentrations reached during therapy have produced <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because naproxen is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to an increase of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in the gastric parietal cell. Esomeprazole is protonated and converted in the acidic compartment of the parietal cell forming the active inhibitor, the achiral sulphenamide. By acting specifically on the proton pump, esomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing gastric acidity. This effect is dose-related up to a daily dose of 20 to 40 mg and leads to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a healthy volunteer study, 10 days of concomitant administration of naproxen 220 mg once- daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane B2 inhibition at 24 hours following the day 10 dose [98.7% (aspirin alone) vs 93.1% (naproxen and aspirin)]. The interaction was observed even following discontinuation of naproxen on day 11 (while aspirin dose was continued) but normalized by day 13. In the same study, the interaction was greater when naproxen was administered 30 minutes prior to aspirin [98.7% vs 87.7%] and minimal when aspirin was administered 30 minutes prior to naproxen [98.7% vs 95.4%].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following administration of naproxen 220 mg twice-daily with low-dose immediate-release aspirin (first naproxen dose given 30 minutes prior to aspirin), the interaction was minimal at 24 h following day 10 dose [98.7% vs 95.7%]. However, the interaction was more prominent after discontinuation of naproxen (washout) on day 11 [98.7% vs 84.3%] and did not normalize completely by day 13 [98.5% vs 90.7%] <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions <linkHtml href="#DRUG_INTERACTIONS">(7)</linkHtml>].</content>

At doses of naproxen greater than 500 mg/day there is less than proportional increase in plasma levels due to an increase in clearance caused by saturation of plasma protein binding at higher doses (average trough C<sub>ss</sub> 36.5, 49.2 and 56.4 mg/L with 500, 1,000 and 1,500 mg daily doses of naproxen, respectively).

                        <paragraph>Naproxen is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP), CYP2C9 and CYP1A2, to 6-0-desmethyl naproxen. Neither the parent drug nor the metabolites induce metabolizing enzymes. Both naproxen and 6-0-desmethyl naproxen are further metabolized to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites. Consistent with the half-life of naproxen, the area under the plasma concentration time curve increases with repeated dosing of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets twice daily.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Esomeprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by the CYP enzyme system. The major part of the metabolism of esomeprazole is dependent on the polymorphic CYP2C19, responsible for the formation of the hydroxyl- and desmethyl metabolites of esomeprazole. The remaining part is dependent on another specific isoform CYP3A4, responsible for the formation of esomeprazole sulphone, the main metabolite in plasma. The major metabolites of esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid secretion.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The area under the plasma esomeprazole concentration-time curve increases with repeated administration of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets. This increase is dose-dependent and results in a non-linear dose-AUC relationship after repeated administration. An increased absorption of esomeprazole with repeated administration of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets probably also contributes to the time-and dose-dependency.   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Given that naproxen, its metabolites and conjugates are primarily excreted by the kidney, the potential exists for naproxen metabolites to accumulate in the presence of renal impairment. Elimination of naproxen is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment. Naproxen­-containing products, including naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium, is not recommended for use in patients with moderate to severe and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30 ml/min) [see <content styleCode="italics">Dosage and Administration</content> (<linkHtml href="#DOSAGE_AND_ADMINISTRATION">2</linkHtml>), <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions</content> (<linkHtml href="#_3a3cfb02-f31c-cf5c-430a-8d63fbfc0ab8">5.6</linkHtml>), <content styleCode="italics">Use in Specific Populations</content> (<linkHtml href="#_0cc5e1c8-289a-36b2-e848-342c900110aa">8.7</linkHtml>)].   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> No studies have been performed with esomeprazole in patients with decreased renal function.

                        <paragraph> In patients with severe hepatic impairment, naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets should be avoided due to increase of risk of NSAID associated bleeding and/or renal failure associated with naproxen. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Chronic alcoholic liver disease and probably also other forms of cirrhosis reduce the total plasma concentration of naproxen, but the plasma concentration of unbound naproxen is increased. The implication of this finding for the naproxen component of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets dosing is unknown but it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> The AUCs of esomeprazole in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class C) have been shown to be 2 to 3 times higher than in patients with normal liver function. For this reason, it has been recommended that esomeprazole doses not exceed 20 mg daily in patients with severe hepatic impairment. However, there is no dose adjustment necessary for patients with Child Pugh Class A and B for the esomeprazole component of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets. There is no naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets dosage form that contains less than 20 mg esomeprazole for twice daily dosing [see <content styleCode="italics">Dosage and Administration</content>

                        <paragraph>A 2-year study was performed in rats to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of naproxen at rat doses of 8, 16, and 24 mg/kg/day (0.05, 0.1, and 0.16 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 1,500 mg/day based on a body surface area comparison). The maximum dose used was 0.28 times the highest recommended human dose. No evidence of tumorigenicity was found.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Esomeprazole</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The carcinogenic potential of esomeprazole was assessed using omeprazole studies, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer. In two 24-month oral carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44 and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.41 to 34.2 times the human dose of 40 mg/day expressed on a body surface area basis) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 3.36 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) for 1 year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of 1 year (94% treated vs 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for 2 years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. A 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> A 28-day toxicity study with a 14-day recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats with esomeprazole magnesium at doses of 70 to 280 mg /kg/day (about 17 to 68 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). An increase in the number of deaths at the high dose of 280 mg /kg/day was observed when juvenile rats were administered esomeprazole magnesium from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 35. In addition, doses equal to or greater than 140 mg/kg/day (about 34 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), produced treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length, and affected overall growth. Comparable findings described above have also been observed in this study with another esomeprazole salt, esomeprazole strontium, at equimolar doses of esomeprazole.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Two randomized, multi-center, double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) compared the incidence of gastric ulcer formation in 428 patients taking naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets and 426 patients taking enteric-coated naproxen. Subjects were at least 18 years of age with a medical condition expected to require daily NSAID therapy for at least 6 months, and, if less than 50 years old, with a documented history of gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. The majority of patients were female (67%), white (86%). The majority of patients were 50 to 69 years of age (83%). Approximately one quarter were on low-dose aspirin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies 1 and 2 showed that naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets given as 500 mg/20 mg twice daily statistically significantly reduced the 6 month cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers compared to enteric-coated naproxen 500 mg twice daily (see Table 6).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Approximately a quarter of the patients in Studies 1 and 2 were taking concurrent low-dose aspirin (≤ 325 mg daily). The results for this subgroup analysis in patients who used aspirin were consistent with the overall findings of the study.</paragraph>

                     <sup>† </sup>For both Studies, p &lt; 0.001 for treatment comparisons of cumulative GU incidence at six months.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In these trials, patients receiving naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets had a mean duration of therapy of 152 days compared to 124 days in patients receiving enteric-coated naproxen alone. A higher proportion of patients taking EC-naproxen (12%) discontinued the study due to upper GI adverse events (including duodenal ulcers) compared to naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets (4%) in both trials [see <content styleCode="italics">Adverse Reactions</content> (<linkHtml href="#ADVERSE_REACTIONS">6</linkHtml>)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The efficacy of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets in treating the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis was established in two 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. In these two trials, patients were allowed to remain on low-dose aspirin for cardioprophylaxis. Naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets were given as 500 mg/20 mg twice daily. In each trial, patients receiving naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release tablets had significantly better results compared to patients receiving placebo as measured by change from baseline of the WOMAC pain subscale and the WOMAC physical function subscale and a Patient Global Assessment Score. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Based on studies with enteric-coated naproxen, improvement in patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis was demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, a reduction in duration of morning stiffness, a reduction in disease activity as assessed by both the investigator and patient, and by increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time. In patients with osteoarthritis, the therapeutic action of naproxen has been shown by a reduction in joint pain or tenderness, an increase in range of motion in knee joints, increased mobility as demonstrated by a reduction in walking time, and improvement in capacity to perform activities of daily living impaired by the disease. In patients with ankylosing spondylitis, naproxen has been shown to decrease night pain, morning stiffness and pain at rest.</paragraph>
