                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dosage must be individualized and closely monitored during up-titration. Prior to initiation of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, stabilize the dose of other heart failure drug therapy. The recommended starting dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets is 25 mg once daily for two weeks in patients with NYHA Class II heart failure and 12.5 mg once daily in patients with more severe heart failure. Double the dose every two weeks to the highest dosage level tolerated by the patient or up to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. Initial difficulty with titration should not preclude later attempts to introduce metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If patients experience symptomatic bradycardia, reduce the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets. If transient worsening of heart failure occurs, consider treating with increased doses of diuretics, lowering the dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or temporarily discontinuing it. The dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure have been stabilized.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician’s advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in patients treated only for hypertension.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem, and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If clonidine and a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol are co-administered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.</paragraph>

                           <br/> Data from published observational studies did not demonstrate an association of major congenital malformations and use of metoprolol in pregnancy. The published literature has reported inconsistent findings of intrauterine growth retardation, preterm birth and perinatal mortality with maternal use of metoprolol during pregnancy; however, these studies have methodological limitations hindering interpretation. Methodological limitations include retrospective design, concomitant use of other medications, and other unadjusted confounders that may account for the study findings including the underlying disease in the mother.

                  <paragraph>Signs and Symptoms - Overdosage of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. Clinical presentation can also include atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness/coma, nausea and vomiting.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Treatment – Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures:</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Metoprolol is a beta     <sub>1</sub>-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta     <sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The relative beta     <sub>1</sub>-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta     <sub>2</sub>-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta     <sub>1</sub>-receptor blocking doses.   </paragraph>

However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity.   </paragraph>

                     <title>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta   <sub>1</sub>-blocking effects in the range of 30 to 80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate) correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta   <sub>1</sub>-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes and blockade of beta   <sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors increases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol/L.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In five controlled studies in normal healthy subjects, extended-release metoprolol succinate administered once a day, and immediate-release metoprolol administered once to four times a day, provided comparable total beta   <sub>1</sub>-blockade over 24 hours (area under the beta   <sub>1</sub>-blockade versus time curve) in the dose range 100 to 400 mg. In another controlled study, 50 mg once daily for each product, extended-release metoprolol succinate produced significantly higher total beta   <sub>1</sub>-blockade over 24 hours than immediate-release metoprolol. For extended-release metoprolol succinate, the percent reduction in exercise heart rate was relatively stable throughout the entire dosage interval and the level of beta   <sub>1</sub>-blockade increased with increasing doses from 50 to 300 mg daily.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A controlled cross-over study in heart failure patients compared the plasma concentrations and beta   <sub>1</sub>-blocking effects of 50 mg immediate-release metoprolol administered t.i.d., and 100 mg and 200 mg extended-release metoprolol succinate once daily. Extended-release metoprolol succinate 200 mg once daily produced a larger effect on suppression of exercise-induced and Holter-monitored heart rate over 24 hours compared to 50 mg t.i.d. of immediate-release metoprolol.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In other studies, treatment with metoprolol succinate produced an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Metoprolol succinate was also shown to delay the increase in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes after 6 months of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in the treatment of angina, hypertension, and heart failure there are situations in which sympathetic stimulation is vital. In patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive. In the presence of AV block, beta-blockade may prevent the necessary facilitating effect of sympathetic activity on conduction. Beta   <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity in patients subject to bronchospasm and may also interfere with exogenous bronchodilators in such patients.  </paragraph>

                           <br/> The peak plasma levels following once-daily administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release average one-fourth to one-half the peak plasma levels obtained following a corresponding dose of conventional metoprolol, administered once daily or in divided doses. At steady state the average bioavailability of metoprolol following administration of metoprolol succinate extended-release, across the dosage range of 50 to 400 mg once daily, was 77% relative to the corresponding single or divided doses of conventional metoprolol.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The bioavailability of metoprolol shows a dose-related, although not directly proportional, increase with dose and is not significantly affected by food following metoprolol succinate extended-release administration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The peak plasma levels following oral administration of conventional metoprolol tablets, however, approximate 50% of levels following intravenous administration, indicating about 50% first-pass metabolism.</paragraph>

                           <br/> Metoprolol crosses the blood-brain barrier and has been reported in the CSF in a concentration 78% of the simultaneous plasma concentration. Only a small fraction of the drug (about 12%) is bound to human serum albumin.  </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Metabolism</content>
                           <br/> Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers and is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. When administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on oxidation phenotype.  </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Elimination</content>
                           <br/> Elimination is mainly by biotransformation in the liver, and the plasma half-life ranges from approximately 3 to 7 hours. Less than 5% of an oral dose of metoprolol is recovered unchanged in the urine; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following intravenous administration of metoprolol, the urinary recovery of unchanged drug is approximately 10%.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Patients with Renal Impairment</content>
                           <br/> The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree from those in normal subjects.  </paragraph>

                           <br/> The pharmacokinetic profile of metoprolol succinate extended-release was studied in 120 pediatric hypertensive patients (6 to 17 years of age) receiving doses ranging from 12.5 to 200 mg once daily. The pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were similar to those described previously in adults. Metoprolol pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in patients &lt; 6 years of age.  </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Body Weight, Age, and Race</content>
                           <br/> Metoprolol apparent oral clearance (CL/F) increased linearly with body weight. Age, gender, and race had no significant effects on metoprolol pharmacokinetics.  </paragraph>

                           <br/> Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. resulted in steady-state concentration of metoprolol 2- to 5-fold what is seen with metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity    <content styleCode="italics">[see     <linkHtml href="#_c1c51c33-488a-4ad1-0730-66c103c6c1d8">Drug Interactions (7.2)</linkHtml>].    </content>

                        <paragraph>Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of metoprolol tartrate. In 2-year studies in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg/day (41 times, on a mg/m   <sup>2</sup> basis, the daily dose of 200 mg for a 60 kg patient), there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg/day (18 times, on a mg/ m   <sup>2</sup> basis, the daily dose of 200 mg for a 60 kg patient), benign lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, nor in the overall incidence of tumors or malignant tumors. This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type of tumor.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All genotoxicity tests performed on metoprolol tartrate (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in somatic cells, a    <content styleCode="italics">Salmonella</content>/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) and metoprolol succinate (a    <content styleCode="italics">Salmonella/</content>mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test) were negative.  </paragraph>

                     <title>14.1 Hypertension</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In a double-blind study, 1,092 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to once daily metoprolol succinate extended-release (25, 100, or 400 mg), PLENDIL   <sup>®</sup> (felodipine extended-release tablets), the combination, or placebo. After 9 weeks, metoprolol succinate extended-release alone decreased sitting blood pressure by 6 to 8/4 to 7 mmHg (placebo-corrected change from baseline) at 24 hours post-dose. The combination of metoprolol succinate extended-release with PLENDIL has greater effects on blood pressure.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical studies, an immediate-release dosage form of metoprolol was an effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, produces similar β   <sub>1</sub>-blockade as conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily. In addition, metoprolol succinate extended-release administered at a dose of 50 mg once daily lowered blood pressure 24-hours post-dosing in placebo-controlled studies. In controlled, comparative, clinical studies, immediate-release metoprolol appeared comparable as an antihypertensive agent to propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, and affected both supine and standing blood pressure. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to drug plasma concentration, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.  </paragraph>

                     <title>14.2 Angina Pectoris</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials, an immediate release formulation of metoprolol has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. Metoprolol succinate extended-release, in dosages of 100 to 400 mg once daily, has been shown to possess beta-blockade similar to conventional metoprolol tablets administered two to four times daily.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.3 Heart Failure</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>MERIT-HF was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of metoprolol succinate extended-release in which 3,991 patients with ejection fraction ≤0.40 and NYHA Class II to IV heart failure attributable to ischemia, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy were randomized 1:1 to metoprolol succinate extended-release or placebo. The protocol excluded patients with contraindications to beta-blocker use, those expected to undergo heart surgery, and those within 28 days of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The primary endpoints of the trial were (1) all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (time to first event) and (2) all-cause mortality. Patients were stabilized on optimal concomitant therapy for heart failure, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, and nitrates. At randomization, 41% of patients were NYHA Class II; 55% NYHA Class III; 65% of patients had heart failure attributed to ischemic heart disease; 44% had a history of hypertension; 25% had diabetes mellitus; 48% had a history of myocardial infarction. Among patients in the trial, 90% were on diuretics, 89% were on ACE inhibitors, 64% were on digitalis, 27% were on a lipid-lowering agent, 37% were on an oral anticoagulant, and the mean ejection fraction was 0.28. The mean duration of follow-up was one year. At the end of the study, the mean daily dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release was 159 mg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The trial was terminated early for a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (34%, nominal p= 0.00009). The risk of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization was reduced by 19% (p= 0.00012). The trial also showed improvements in heart failure-related mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations, and NYHA functional class.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The table below shows the principal results for the overall study population. The figure below illustrates principal results for a wide variety of subgroup comparisons, including U.S. vs. non-U.S. populations (the latter of which was not pre-specified). The combined endpoints of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization and of mortality plus heart failure hospitalization showed consistent effects in the overall study population and the subgroups. Nonetheless, subgroup analyses can be difficult to interpret and it is not known whether these represent true differences or chance effects.</paragraph>
