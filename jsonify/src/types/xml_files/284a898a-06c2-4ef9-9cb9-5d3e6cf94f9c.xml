                     <title>5.1	Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In placebo-controlled clinical studies (two flexible-dose and one fixed-dose study) of dementia-related psychosis, there was an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, in oral aripiprazole-treated patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78 to 88 years). In the fixed-dose study, there was a statistically significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with oral aripiprazole.

                        <paragraph>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex has been reported with antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS have been reported during aripiprazole treatment in the global clinical database.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4	Tardive Dyskinesia</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose increases. The syndrome can develop, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and may mask the underlying process. The effect of symptomatic suppression on the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Given these considerations, ABILIFY ASIMTUFII should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII despite the presence of the syndrome.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. </paragraph>

                              </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with diabetic   ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients treated with aripiprazole <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes), who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics, including ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the atypical antipsychotic drug.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a short-term, placebo-controlled randomized trial in adults with schizophrenia, the mean change in fasting glucose was +9.8 mg/dL (N=88) in the Abilify Maintena-treated patients (once monthly dosing) and +0.7 mg/dL (N=59) in the placebo-treated patients. Table 3 shows the proportion of Abilify Maintena-treated patients with normal and borderline fasting glucose at baseline and their changes in fasting glucose measurements. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Post-marketing case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these urges while taking aripiprazole. Other compulsive urges, reported less frequently, include: sexual urges, shopping, eating or binge eating, and other impulsive or compulsive behaviors. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or intense gambling urges, compulsive sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the underlying disorder. In some cases, although not all, urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced, or the medication was discontinued. Compulsive behaviors may result in harm to the patient and others if not recognized. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>ABILIFY ASIMTUFII may cause orthostatic hypotension, perhaps due to its Î±1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated reactions related to orthostatic hypotension can include dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial in adults with schizophrenia, the adverse reaction of presyncope was reported in 1/167 (0.6%) of patients treated with Abilify Maintena (once monthly dosing), while syncope and orthostatic hypotension were each reported in 1/172 (0.6%) of patients treated with placebo. During the stabilization phase of the randomized-withdrawal (maintenance) study in adult patients with schizophrenia, orthostasis-related adverse events were reported in 4/576 (0.7%) of patients treated with Abilify Maintena, including abnormal orthostatic blood pressure (1/576, 0.2%), postural dizziness (1/576, 0.2%), presyncope (1/576, 0.2%) and orthostatic hypotension (1/576, 0.2%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the short-term placebo-controlled trial of Abilify Maintena in adults with schizophrenia, there were no patients in either treatment group with a significant orthostatic change in blood pressure (defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure â¥20 mmHg accompanied by an increase in heart rate â¥25 bpm when comparing standing to supine values). During the stabilization phase of the randomized-withdrawal (maintenance) study in adult patients with schizophrenia, the incidence of significant orthostatic change in blood pressure was 0.2% (1/575).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use ABILIFY ASIMTUFII with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (heart failure, history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.</paragraph>

This analysis did not reveal evidence of differences in safety differential adverse reaction incidence on the basis of age, gender, or race alone; however, there were few patients â¥65 years of age.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The percentage of patients in the open-label study reporting any injection site-related adverse reactions (all reported as injection site pain) was 19% for patients treated with ABILIFY ASIMTUFII 960 mg and 9% for patients treated with Abilify Maintena 400 mg. In both treatment groups, the majority of the injection site pain events coincided with the first injection of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII 960 mg (21/24 patients) or Abilify Maintena 400 mg (7/12 patients), was reported with decreasing frequency upon subsequent injections. The overall mean visual analog scale scores (0=no pain to 100=unbearably painful) for patient reported rating of pain were similar in both treatment groups at the last injection: 0.8 pre-dose and 1.4 post-dose for the ABILIFY ASIMTUFII 960 mg group compared to 1.3 post-dose for the Abilify Maintena 400 mg group.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. In the short-term, placebo-controlled trial of Abilify Maintena in adults with schizophrenia, the incidence of dystonia was 1.8% for Abilify Maintena vs. 0.6% for placebo.</paragraph>

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: occurrences of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, laryngospasm, pruritus/urticaria, or oropharyngeal spasm), blood glucose fluctuation, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), hiccups, pathological gambling, and fecal incontinence.</paragraph>

Oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during the pre- and post-natal period in rats at doses 10 times the oral MRHD produced prolonged gestation, stillbirths, decreased pup weight, and decreased pup survival <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#data">Data</linkHtml>)</content>. </paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>No developmental toxicity studies were conducted with intramuscular aripiprazole suspension.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In animal oral or intravenous studies, aripiprazole demonstrated developmental toxicity, including possible teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Pregnant rats were treated with oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day which are approximately 1 to 10 times the oral MRHD of 30 mg/day on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis of aripiprazole during the period of organogenesis. Treatment at the highest dose caused a slight prolongation of gestation and delay in fetal development, as evidenced by decreased fetal weight and undescended testes. Delayed skeletal ossification was observed at 3 and 10 times the oral MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>At 3 and 10 times the oral MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, delivered offspring had decreased body weights. Increased incidences of hepatodiaphragmatic nodules and diaphragmatic hernia were observed in offspring from the highest dose group (the other dose groups were not examined for these findings). Postnatally, delayed vaginal opening was seen at 3 and 10 times the oral MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis and impaired reproductive performance (decreased fertility rate, corpora lutea, implants, live fetuses, and increased post-implantation loss, likely mediated through effects on female offspring) along with some maternal toxicity were seen at the highest dose; however, there was no evidence to suggest that these developmental effects were secondary to maternal toxicity. </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In pregnant rats treated with aripiprazole intravenously at doses of 3, 9, and 27 mg/kg/day, which are 1 to 9 times the oral MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, during the period of organogenesis, decreased fetal weight and delayed skeletal ossification were seen at the highest dose which also caused maternal toxicity.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In pregnant rabbits treated with oral doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day which are 2 to 11 times human exposure at the oral MRHD based on AUC and 6 to 65 times the oral MRHD of aripiprazole on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis during the period of organogenesis, decreased maternal food consumption and increased abortions were seen at the highest dose as well as increased fetal mortality. Decreased fetal weight and increased incidence of fused sternebrae were observed at 3 and 11 times the oral MRHD based on AUC. </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In pregnant rabbits receiving aripiprazole injection intravenously at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day, which are 2 to 19 times the oral MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis during the period of organogenesis, the highest dose caused pronounced maternal toxicity that resulted in decreased fetal weight, increased fetal abnormalities (primarily skeletal), and decreased fetal skeletal ossification. The fetal no-effect dose was 5 times the human exposure at the oral MRHD based on AUC and is 6 times the oral MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In rats treated with oral doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day, which are 1 to 10 times the oral MRHD of aripiprazole on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, peri- and post-natally (from Day 17 of gestation through Day 21 postpartum), slight maternal toxicity and slightly prolonged gestation were seen at the highest dose. An increase in stillbirths and decreases in pup weight (persisting into adulthood) and survival were also seen at this dose. </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In rats treated with aripiprazole intravenously at doses of 3, 8, and 20 mg/kg/day which are 1 to 6 times the oral MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis from Day 6 of gestation through Day 20 postpartum, increased stillbirths were seen at 3 and 6 times the oral MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, and decreases in early postnatal pup weight and survival were seen at the highest dose; these doses produced some maternal toxicity. There were no effects on postnatal behavioral and reproductive development.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. Based on published case reports and pharmacovigilance reports, aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period may lead to clinically relevant decreases in milk supply which may be reversible with discontinuation of the drug. There are also reports of aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and no maternal milk supply in the post-partum period. Effects on milk supply may be mediated through decreases in prolactin levels, which have been observed <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>].</content> Monitor the breastfed infant for dehydration and lack of appropriate weight gain. The developmental  and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ABILIFY ASIMTUFII or from the underlying maternal condition. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>No juvenile animal studies were conducted with intramuscular aripiprazole suspension. A study with oral aripiprazole in juvenile rats caused mortality, CNS clinical signs, impaired memory and learning, and delayed sexual maturation when administered at doses of 10, 20, 40 mg/kg/day from weaning (21 days old) through maturity (80 days old). At 40 mg/kg/day, mortality, decreased activity, splayed hind limbs, hunched posture, ataxia, tremors and other CNS signs were observed in both genders. In addition, delayed sexual maturation was observed in males. At all doses and in a dose-dependent manner, impaired memory and learning, increased motor activity, and histopathology changes in the pituitary (atrophy), adrenals (adrenocortical hypertrophy), mammary glands (hyperplasia and increased secretion), and female reproductive organs (vaginal mucification, endometrial atrophy, decrease in ovarian corpora lutea) were observed. The changes in female reproductive organs were considered secondary to the increase in prolactin serum levels. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) could not be determined and, at the lowest tested dose of 10 mg/kg/day, there is no safety margin relative to the systemic exposures (AUC<sub>0-24</sub>) for aripiprazole or its major active metabolite in adolescents at the maximum recommended oral pediatric dose of 15 mg/day. All drug-related effects were reversible after a 2-month recovery period, and most of the drug effects in juvenile rats were also observed in adult rats from previously conducted studies.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Aripiprazole in juvenile dogs (2 months old) caused CNS clinical signs of tremors, hypoactivity, ataxia, recumbency and limited use of hind limbs when administered orally for 6 months at 3, 10, 30 mg/kg/day. Mean body weight and weight gain were decreased up to 18% in females in all drug groups relative to control values. A NOAEL could not be determined and, at the lowest tested dose of 3 mg/kg/day, there is no safety margin relative to the systemic exposures (AUC<sub>0-24</sub>) for aripiprazole or its major active metabolite in adolescents at the maximum recommended oral pediatric dose of 15 mg/day. All drug-related effects were reversible after a 2-month recovery period.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of aripiprazole could be mediated through a combination of partial agonist activity at dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Aripiprazole exhibits high affinity for dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> (K<sub>i</sub>s 0.34 and 0.8 nM, respectively), serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors (K<sub>i</sub>s 1.7 and 3.4 nM, respectively), moderate affinity for dopamine D<sub>4</sub>, serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, alpha<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic and histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors (K<sub>i</sub>s of 44 nM, 15 nM, 39 nM, 57 nM, and 61 nM, respectively), and moderate affinity for the serotonin reuptake site (K<sub>i=</sub>98 nM). Aripiprazole has no appreciable affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors (IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;1000 nM). Actions at receptors other than D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> could explain some of the other adverse reactions of aripiprazole (e.g., the orthostatic hypotension observed with aripiprazole may be explained by its antagonist activity at adrenergic alpha<sub>1</sub> receptors).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ABILIFY ASIMTUFII activity is presumably primarily due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, which has been shown to have affinities for D<sub>2</sub> receptors.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>ABILIFY ASIMTUFII delivers aripiprazole over a 2-month period. ABILIFY ASIMTUFII has linear pharmacokinetics in the approved dose range. Steady-state aripiprazole exposures were reached by the fourth dose. Plasma exposures at steady state were compared between ABILIFY ASIMTUFII (960 mg, once every 2 months) and Abilify Maintena (400 mg, once every month). The average plasma concentrations (C<sub>avg</sub>) of aripiprazole were 263 ng/mL and 280 ng/mL for ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and Abilify Maintena, respectively. The C<sub>max</sub> of aripiprazole were 342 ng/mL and 344 ng/mL for ABILIFY ASIMTUFII and Abilify Maintena, respectively. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Aripiprazole absorption into the systemic circulation is prolonged following gluteal intramuscular injection due to low solubility of aripiprazole particles. The release profile of aripiprazole from ABILIFY ASIMTUFII results in sustained plasma concentrations over 2 months following gluteal injection(s). Following multiple doses, the median peak:trough ratio for aripiprazole following an ABILIFY ASIMTUFII dose is 1.3, resulting in a flat plasma concentration profile with T<sub>max</sub> ranging between 1 to 49 days following multiple gluteal administrations of 960 mg.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Aripiprazole is metabolized primarily by three biotransformation pathways: dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant drug moiety in the systemic circulation. Following administration of multiple doses of ABILIFY ASIMTUFII, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents approximately 29% of aripiprazole AUC in plasma. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted with oral aripiprazole in Swiss albino mice, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and F344 rats. Oral aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats (0.2 to 5 times and 0.3 to 3 times oral MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day (3 to 19 times the oral MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup>). Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or male rats. In female mice, the incidence of pituitary gland adenomas, mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day (0.5 to 5 times the oral MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup>). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (3 times the oral MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup>); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (19 times the oral MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup>).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Proliferative changes in the pituitary and mammary gland of rodents have been observed following chronic administration of other antipsychotic agents and are considered prolactin-mediated. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13-week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4-week and 13-week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unknown. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The toxicological profile for aripiprazole administered to experimental animals by intramuscular injection is generally similar to that seen following oral administration at comparable plasma levels of the drug. In dogs, repeated intramuscular dosing of the 2-month aripiprazole extended release injectable suspension over a period of 52 weeks produced no clinical evidence of significant local irritation, and resulted in slight foreign-body type of localized granulomatous inflammatory reaction to deposited drug at the injection site. These effects gradually resolved with discontinuation of dosing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral aripiprazole produced retinal degeneration in albino rats in a 26-week chronic toxicity study at a dose of 60 mg/kg and in a 2-year carcinogenicity study at doses of 40 and 60 mg/kg. The 40 and 60 mg/kg/day doses are 13 and 19 times the maximum recommended human oral dose (MRHD) based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface and 7 to 14 times human exposure at the oral MRHD based on AUC. Evaluation of the retinas of albino mice and of monkeys did not reveal evidence of retinal degeneration. Additional studies to further evaluate the mechanism have not been performed. The relevance of this finding to human risk is unknown.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In the short-term (12-week), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in acutely relapsed adults (Study 1), the primary measure used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30-item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in PANSS total score to week 10.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The inclusion criteria for this short-term trial included adult inpatients who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia. In addition, all patients entering the trial must have experienced an acute psychotic episode as defined by both PANSS Total Score â¥80 and a PANSS score of &gt;4 on each of four specific psychotic symptoms (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness/persecution, unusual thought content) at screening and baseline. The key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) assessment scale to week 10. The CGI-S rates the severity of mental illness on a scale of 1 (normal) to 7 (among the most extremely ill) based on the total clinical experience of the rater in treating patients with schizophrenia. Patients had a mean PANSS total score of 103 (range 82 to 144) and a CGI-S score of 5.2 (markedly ill) at entry.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In this 12-week study (n=339) comparing Abilify Maintena (n=167) to placebo (n=172), patients were administered 400 mg Abilify Maintena or placebo on days 0, 28, and 56. The dose could be adjusted down and up within the range of 400 to 300 mg on a one-time basis. Abilify Maintena was superior to placebo in improving the PANSS total score at the end of week 10 (see <linkHtml href="#TB8">Table 8</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
