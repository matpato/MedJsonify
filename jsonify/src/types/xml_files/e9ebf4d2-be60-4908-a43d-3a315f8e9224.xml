                        <paragraph>Butorphanol is a partial opioid agonist at the mu opioid receptor and a full agonist at the kappa opioid receptor.  The principal therapeutic action of butorphanol is analgesia.  Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown.  However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The analgesic effect of butorphanol is influenced by the route of administration. Onset of analgesia is within 15 minutes for the nasal administration doses. Peak analgesic activity occurs within 1 to 2 hours following nasal spray administration. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The duration of analgesia varies depending on the pain model as well as the route of administration. Compared to the injectable form and other drugs in this class, Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray has a longer duration of action (4 to 5 hours) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_17627307-5ecb-4a78-a7e5-3d64144e51ee">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>; <linkHtml href="#ID_eb195906-8e66-4d51-9c53-12a29ed8a434">Clinical Trials</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Butorphanol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In human studies involving individuals without significant respiratory dysfunction, 2 mg of butorphanol IV and 10 mg of morphine sulfate IV depressed respiration to a comparable degree. At higher doses, the magnitude of respiratory depression with butorphanol is not appreciably increased; however, the duration of respiratory depression is longer. Respiratory depression noted after administration of butorphanol to humans by any route is reversed by treatment with naloxone, a specific opioid antagonist <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_7ffdfed3-8bba-4aa1-8e02-01fba9f5f691">OVERDOSAGE</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Butorphanol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.  </paragraph>

Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dose proportionality for Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray has been determined at steady state in doses up to 4 mg at 6 hour intervals. Steady state is achieved within 2 days. The mean peak plasma concentration at steady state was 1.8-fold (maximal 3-fold) following a single dose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The drug is transported across the blood brain and placental barriers and into human milk <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_4f097219-e7da-4ba0-81fc-bb4ef602067e">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#ID_ccd1f58e-cf26-4531-8719-b942ff330193">Labor and Delivery</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_5ad87ddb-908b-440e-8bcd-a2f2dbaf5ce9">Nursing Mothers</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Butorphanol is extensively metabolized in the liver. Metabolism is qualitatively and quantitatively similar following intravenous, intramuscular, or nasal administration. Oral bioavailability is only 5% to 17% because of extensive first pass metabolism of butorphanol. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The major metabolite of butorphanol is hydroxybutorphanol, while norbutorphanol is produced in small amounts. Both have been detected in plasma following administration of butorphanol, with norbutorphanol present at trace levels at most time points. The elimination half-life of hydroxybutorphanol is about 18 hours and, as a consequence, considerable accumulation (~5-fold) occurs when butorphanol is dosed to steady state (1 mg transnasally q6h for 5 days). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elimination occurs by urine and fecal excretion. When 3H labelled butorphanol is administered to normal subjects, most (70% to 80%) of the dose is recovered in the urine, while approximately 15% is recovered in the feces. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>About 5% of the dose is recovered in the urine as butorphanol. Forty-nine percent is eliminated in the urine as hydroxybutorphanol. Less than 5% is excreted in the urine as norbutorphanol. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Butorphanol pharmacokinetics in the elderly differ from younger patients (see <content styleCode="bold">Table 1</content>). The mean absolute bioavailability of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in elderly women (48%) was less than that in elderly men (75%), young men (68%), or young women (70%). Elimination half-life is increased in the elderly (6.6 hours as opposed to 4.7 hours in younger subjects). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In renally impaired patients with creatinine clearances &lt;30 mL/min, the elimination half-life was approximately doubled and the total body clearance was approximately one half (10.5 hours [clearance 150 L/h] as compared to 5.8 hours [clearance 260 L/h] in healthy subjects). No effect on C<sub>max</sub> or T<sub>max</sub> was observed after a single dose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After intravenous administration to patients with hepatic impairment, the elimination half-life of butorphanol was approximately tripled and total body clearance was approximately one half (half-life 16.8 hours, clearance 92 L/h) compared to healthy subjects (half-life 4.8 hours, clearance 175 L/h). The exposure of hepatically impaired patients to butorphanol was significantly greater (about 2-fold) than that in healthy subjects. Similar results were seen after nasal administration. No effect on C<sub>max</sub> or T<sub>max</sub> was observed after a single intranasal dose. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg dose of butorphanol administered as Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray were not affected by the coadministration of a single 6 mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan. However, in another study in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of butorphanol were significantly altered (29% decrease in AUC and 38% decreases in C<sub>max</sub>) when a 1 mg dose of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray was administered 1 minute after a 20 mg dose of sumatriptan nasal spray. (The two drugs were administered in opposite nostrils.) When the Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray was administered 30 minutes after the sumatriptan nasal spray, the AUC of butorphanol increased 11% and C<sub>max</sub> decreased 18%. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In neither case were the pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan affected by coadministration with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. These results suggest that the analgesic effect of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray may be diminished when it is administered shortly after sumatriptan nasal spray, but by 30 minutes any such reduction in effect should be minimal. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of using Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and IMITREX<sup>®1</sup> (sumatriptan) Nasal Spray during the same episode of migraine has not been established.

                           <content styleCode="underline">Postoperative Pain:</content> The analgesic efficacy of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray was evaluated (approximately 35 patients per treatment group) in a general and orthopedic surgery trial. Single doses of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray (1 or 2 mg) and IM meperidine (37.5 or 75 mg) were compared. Analgesia provided by 1 and 2 mg doses of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray was similar to 37.5 and 75 mg meperidine, respectively, with onset of analgesia within 15 minutes and peak analgesic effect within 1 hour. The median duration of pain relief was 2.5 hours with 1 mg Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, 3.5 hours with 2 mg Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and 3.3 hours with either dose of meperidine. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a postcesarean section trial, Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray administered to 35 patients as two 1 mg doses 60 minutes apart was compared with a single 2 mg dose of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray or a single 2 mg IV dose of butorphanol tartrate injection (37 patients each). Onset of analgesia was within 15 minutes for all butorphanol tartrate regimens. Peak analgesic effects of 2 mg intravenous butorphanol tartrate injection and Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray were similar in magnitude. The duration of pain relief provided by both 2 mg Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray regimens was approximately 4.5 hours and was greater than intravenous butorphanol tartrate injection (2.6 hours). </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Migraine Headache Pain:</content> The analgesic efficacy of two 1 mg doses 1 hour apart of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in migraine headache pain was compared with a single dose of 10 mg IM methadone (31 and 32 patients, respectively). Significant onset of analgesia occurred within 15 minutes for both Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and IM methadone. Peak analgesic effect occurred at 2 hours for Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and 1.5 hours for methadone. The median duration of pain relief was 6 hours with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and 4 hours with methadone as judged by the time when approximately half of the patients remedicated. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In two other trials in patients with migraine headache pain, a 2 mg initial dose of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray followed by an additional 1 mg dose 1 hour later (76 patients) was compared with either 75 mg IM meperidine (24 patients) or placebo (72 patients). Onset, peak activity and duration were similar with both active treatments; however, the incidence of adverse experiences (nausea, vomiting, dizziness) was higher in these two trials with the 2 mg initial dose of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray than in the trial with the 1 mg initial dose. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray contains butorphanol, a Schedule IV controlled substance. As an opioid, Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_aa080100-8166-435f-9946-a64538179d36">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, and reassess all patients receiving Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_42c97716-b312-4e7a-8795-b9d5eb74a9f3">WARNINGS</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_d41adfde-b4f3-4136-815a-c6010ed57f6a">Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</linkHtml>; <linkHtml href="#ID_3a9a69ad-6216-4ade-b1f1-240dfbea1ed7">Dosage and Administration</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_70aeccbd-a571-4df0-96b7-306a9cc3e78a">Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.     </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone.  Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_753d181c-b697-4eb2-a845-5a95841cf572">PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions</linkHtml>]</content>.     </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use.  In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_d41adfde-b4f3-4136-815a-c6010ed57f6a">WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression</linkHtml>; <linkHtml href="#ID_3a9a69ad-6216-4ade-b1f1-240dfbea1ed7">Dosage and Administration</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_70aeccbd-a571-4df0-96b7-306a9cc3e78a">Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_934aeed8-a4f5-4709-823b-557c0b521a53">Dependence</linkHtml>]</content>. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_3a9a69ad-6216-4ade-b1f1-240dfbea1ed7">Dosage and Administration</linkHtml>; <linkHtml href="#ID_42c97716-b312-4e7a-8795-b9d5eb74a9f3">Warnings</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO<sub>2</sub> retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO<sub>2</sub> retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury.  Avoid the use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is not recommended during labor or delivery because there is no clinical experience with its use in this setting. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Although there is no clinical experience with the use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in nursing mothers, butorphanol has been detected in milk following administration of butorphanol tartrate injection to nursing mothers. The amount an infant would receive is probably clinically insignificant (estimated 4 mcg/L of milk in a mother receiving 2 mg IM four times a day). It should be assumed that butorphanol will appear in the milk in similar amounts following the nasal route of administration. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from butorphanol or from the underlying maternal condition.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Infants exposed to Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Of the approximately 1700 patients treated with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in clinical studies, 8% were 65 years of age or older and 2% were 75 years or older. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Due to changes in clearance, the mean half-life of butorphanol is increased by 25% (to over 6 hours) in patients over the age of 65 years <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_674652d9-9638-43dd-ad42-16c5a4adc98d">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics</linkHtml>].</content> Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of butorphanol. In clinical studies of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, elderly patients had an increased frequency of headache, dizziness, drowsiness, vertigo, constipation, nausea and/or vomiting, and nasal congestion compared with younger patients. There are insufficient efficacy data for patients ≥65 years to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Initially a 1 mg dose of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray should be generally used in geriatric patients and 90 to 120 minutes should elapse before administering a second 1 mg dose, if needed <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_daa3ca4e-c479-48fe-adcc-2dde8b8010e5">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Individualization of Dosage</linkHtml>]. </content>

                        <paragraph>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were coadministered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_42c97716-b312-4e7a-8795-b9d5eb74a9f3">WARNINGS</linkHtml>]. </content>

                        <paragraph>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The most frequently reported adverse experiences across all clinical trials with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray were somnolence (49%), dizziness (23%), nausea and/or vomiting (8%). In long-term trials with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray only, nasal congestion (13%) and insomnia (11%) were frequently reported. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following adverse experiences were reported at a frequency of 1% or greater in clinical trials, and were considered to be probably related to the use of butorphanol. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Misuse and abuse of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing butorphanol, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in combination with other abused drugs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When discontinuing Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_3a9a69ad-6216-4ade-b1f1-240dfbea1ed7">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_42c97716-b312-4e7a-8795-b9d5eb74a9f3">WARNINGS</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <title>Treatment of Overdose   </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to butorphanol tartrate overdose, administer an opioid antagonist. As butorphanol is a mixed opioid agonist/antagonist, larger doses of naloxone may be needed to reverse the effects of an overdose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of butorphanol in Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_42c97716-b312-4e7a-8795-b9d5eb74a9f3">WARNINGS</linkHtml>]</content>. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_42c97716-b312-4e7a-8795-b9d5eb74a9f3">WARNINGS</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray.

                        <paragraph>Individually titrate Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_42c97716-b312-4e7a-8795-b9d5eb74a9f3">WARNINGS</linkHtml>]</content>. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_42c97716-b312-4e7a-8795-b9d5eb74a9f3">WARNINGS</linkHtml>]</content>.

                     <title>Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Butorphanol Tartrate   </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids.  Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient.  It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis.  Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_00549047-3c99-4e3a-a1ff-99bf85960140">WARNINGS: Withdrawal</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_aa080100-8166-435f-9946-a64538179d36">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
