                     <text>
                        <paragraph>AMPYRA can cause seizures. Increased incidence of seizures has been observed at 20 mg twice daily (2 times the maximum recommended dosage) in controlled clinical studies of 9â14 weeks duration with dalfampridine in patients with MS. In open-label extension trials in MS patients, the incidence of seizures during treatment with dalfampridine 15 mg twice daily (1.7/100PY) was over 4 times higher than the incidence during treatment with 10 mg twice daily (0.4/100PY). In the post-marketing period seizures have been reported. The majority of seizures occurred at the recommended dose and in patients without a history of seizures, and generally within days to weeks of starting therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>AMPYRA has not been evaluated in patients with a history of seizures or with evidence of epileptiform activity on an EEG, as these patients were excluded from clinical trials. The risk of seizures in patients with epileptiform activity on an EEG is unknown, and could be substantially higher than that observed in AMPYRA clinical studies. Permanently discontinue AMPYRA in patients who have a seizure while on treatment. AMPYRA is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>] </content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to 14 weeks duration, 4% (15/400) of patients treated with AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily experienced one or more adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, compared to 2% (5/238) of placebo-treated patients. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of at least 2 patients treated with AMPYRA and that led to discontinuation more frequently compared to placebo were headache (AMPYRA 0.5%, placebo 0%), balance disorder (AMPYRA 0.5%, placebo 0%), dizziness (AMPYRA 0.5%, placebo 0%), and confusional state (AMPYRA 0.3%, placebo 0%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in â¥2% of patients treated with AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, in controlled clinical trials.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>AMPYRA has been evaluated in a total of 1,952 subjects, including 917 MS patients. A total of 741 patients have been treated with AMPYRA for over six months, 501 for over one year and 352 for over two years. The experience in open-label clinical trials is consistent with the safety profile observed in the placebo-controlled clinical trials. As in controlled clinical trials, a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of seizures has been observed in open-label clinical trials with AMPYRA in patients with MS as follows: AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily 0.41 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 0.13â0.96); dalfampridine 15 mg twice daily 1.7 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 0.21â6.28).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of AMPYRA in pregnant women. Administration of dalfampridine to animals during pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased offspring viability and growth at clinically relevant doses [see <content styleCode="italics">

                           </content>]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oral administration of dalfampridine to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in no evidence of developmental toxicity in either species. The highest doses tested (10 mg/kg/day in rats, 5 mg/kg/day in rabbits), which were associated with maternal toxicity, are approximately 5 times the MRHD on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of dalfampridine (0, 1, 3, and 9 to 6 mg/kg/day; high dose reduced during the second week of dosing) to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased offspring viability at the highest dose tested and decreased body weight in offspring at the mid and high doses. The no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Three cases of overdose were reported in controlled clinical trials with AMPYRA, involving two MS patients. The first patient took six times the currently recommended dose (60 mg) and was taken to the emergency room with altered mental state. The second patient took 40 mg doses on two separate occasions. In the first instance, she experienced a complex partial seizure and, in the second instance, a period of confusion. Both patients recovered by the following day without sequelae.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Several cases of overdose are found in the scientific literature in which various formulations of dalfampridine were used, resulting in numerous adverse events including seizure, confusion, tremulousness, diaphoresis, and amnesia. In some instances, patients developed status epilepticus, requiring intensive supportive care and were responsive to standard therapy for seizures. In one published case report, an MS patient who ingested 300 mg of 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) developed a condition that resembled limbic encephalitis. This patient developed weakness, reduced awareness, memory loss, hypophonic speech, and temporal lobe hyperintensities on MRI. The patient's speech and language and ambulation improved over time, and an MRI at 4 months after the overdose no longer showed signal abnormalities. At one year, the patient continued to have difficulty with short term memory and learning new tasks.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Orally administered dalfampridine is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Absolute bioavailability of extended release AMPYRA tablets has not been assessed, but relative bioavailability is 96% when compared to an aqueous oral solution. The extended release tablet delays absorption of dalfampridine relative to the solution formulation, giving a slower rise to a lower peak concentration (Cmax), with no effect on the extent of absorption (AUC). Single AMPYRA tablet 10 mg doses administered to healthy volunteers in a fasted state gave peak concentrations ranging from 17.3 ng/mL to 21.6 ng/mL occurring 3 to 4 hours post-administration (Tmax). In comparison, Cmax with the same 10 mg dose of dalfampridine in an oral solution was 42.7 ng/mL and occurred approximately 1.3 hours after dosing. Exposure increased proportionally with dose.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of dalfampridine was studied in 9 male and 11 female subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Elimination of the drug is significantly correlated with the creatinine clearance. Total body clearance of dalfampridine was reduced by about 45 % in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 51â80 mL/min), by about 50% in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl = 30â50 mL/min), and by about 75% in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min). The terminal half-life of dalfampridine is about 3.3 times longer in patients with severe renal impairment but is not prolonged in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The effectiveness of AMPYRA in improving walking in patients with multiple sclerosis was evaluated in two adequate and well controlled trials involving 540 patients. Patients in these two clinical trials had a mean disease duration of 13 years and a mean Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 6.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Trial 1 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 21-week study (one week post screening, two-week, single-blind placebo run-in, 14-week double-blind treatment, and 4-week no treatment follow-up) in 301 patients with multiple sclerosis at 33 centers in the U.S. and Canada: 229 patients assigned to AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily and 72 patients assigned to placebo. A total of 283 patients (212 AMPYRA and 71 placebo) completed all study visits. Patient inclusion criteria included the ability to walk 25 feet in 8â45 seconds. Patient exclusion criteria included a history of seizures or evidence of epileptiform activity on a screening EEG, and onset of an MS exacerbation within 60 days.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Trial 2 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 14-week study (one week post-screening, two weeks of single-blind, placebo run-in, nine weeks of double-blind treatment, and two weeks of no-treatment follow-up) in 239 patients with multiple sclerosis at 39 centers in the U.S. and Canada: 120 patients assigned to 10 mg twice daily and 119 assigned to placebo. A total of 227 patients (113 AMPYRA and 114 placebo) completed all study visits. The patient inclusion and exclusion criteria used in Trial 1 were employed in Trial 2, and in addition patients with severe renal impairment were also excluded.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The primary measure of efficacy in both trials was walking speed (in feet per second) as measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), using a responder analysis. A responder was defined as a patient who showed faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double-blind period than the maximum value achieved in the five non-double-blind no treatment visits (four before the double-blind period and one after).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A significantly greater proportion of patients taking AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily were responders, compared to patients taking placebo, as measured by the T25FW (Trial 1: 34.8% vs. 8.3%; Trial 2: 42.9% vs. 9.3%). The increased response rate in the AMPYRA group was observed across all four major types of MS disease course.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During the double-blind treatment period, a significantly greater proportion of patients taking AMPYRA 10 mg twice daily had increases in walking speed of at least 10%, 20%, or 30% from baseline, compared to placebo (Figure 1 and Figure 2).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In Trial 1 and Trial 2, consistent improvements in walking speed were shown to be associated with improvements on a patient self-assessment of ambulatory disability, the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), for both drug and placebo treated patients. However, a drug-placebo difference was not established for that outcome measure.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The majority of patients in these trials (63%) were using immunomodulatory drugs (interferons, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab), but the magnitude of improvement in walking ability was independent of concomitant treatment with these drugs. No differences in effectiveness based on degree of impairment, age, gender, or body mass index were detected. There were too few non-Caucasians in the patient population to evaluate the effect of race.</paragraph>
