                     <title>2.5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Tramadol Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen Tablets</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid<content ID="bookmark6"/> discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.<br/>
                           <br/> When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.<br/>
                           <br/> There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on opioids who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and use a gradual downward taper. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.<br/>
                           <br/> It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.<br/>
                           <br/> When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.20">Warnings and Precautions (5.21)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Section_9.3">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol, a Schedule IV controlled substance. As an opioid, tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_9">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, and reassess all patients receiving tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_2.5">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Section_5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.<content ID="bookmark10"/>

                        <paragraph>Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_10">Overdosage (10)</linkHtml>]</content>. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase.<br/>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in  patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_7">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation).<br/>
                           <br/> If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_2.5">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Section_5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>].</content>

                           <br/> Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_7">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Section_17">Patient Counseling Information (17)</linkHtml>]</content>.<content ID="bookmark15"/>

                        <paragraph>Use of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_8.1">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Section_17">Patient Counseling Information (17)</linkHtml>].<content ID="bookmark12"/>

                        <paragraph>Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received tramadol. Tramadol and codeine are subject to variability in metabolism based upon CYP2D6 genotype (described below), which can lead to increased exposure to an active metabolite. Based upon postmarketing reports with tramadol or with codeine, children younger than 12 years of age may be more susceptible to the respiratory depressant effects of tramadol. Furthermore, children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with opioids for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to their respiratory depressant effect.

                        <paragraph>Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain <content styleCode="xmChange">a</content> defined effect <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_9.3">Dependence (9.3)</linkHtml>].</content> Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.<content ID="bookmark19"/>

                        <paragraph>Hyponatremia (serum sodium &lt; 135 mmol/L) has been reported with the use of tramadol, and many cases are severe (sodium level &lt; 120 mmol/L). Most cases of hyponatremia occurred in females over the age of 65 and within the first week of therapy. In some reports, hyponatremia resulted from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Regularly evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of hyponatremia (e.g., confusion, disorientation), during treatment with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, especially during initiation of therapy. If signs and symptoms of hyponatremia are present, initiate appropriate treatment (e.g., fluid restriction) and discontinue tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_2.4">Dosage and Administration: Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Tramadol Hydrochloride and Acetaminophen Tablets (2.5)</linkHtml>].</content>

                        <paragraph>Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.5">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</linkHtml>]</content>. Available data with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen decreased fetal weights and increased supernumerary ribs at 1.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage (MRHD). In separate animal reproduction studies, tramadol administration alone during organogenesis decreased fetal weights and reduced ossification in mice, rats, and rabbits at 1.4, 0.6, and 3.6 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage (MRHD). Tramadol decreased pup body weight and increased pup mortality at 1.2 and 1.9 times the MRHD.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and mice from the published literature identified adverse events at clinically relevant doses with acetaminophen. Treatment of pregnant rats with doses of acetaminophen approximately 1.3 times the maximum human daily dose (MRHD) showed evidence of fetotoxicity and increases in bone variations in the fetuses. In another study, necrosis was observed in the liver and kidney of both pregnant rats and fetuses at doses approximately 1.9 times the MHDD. In mice treated with acetaminophen at doses within the clinical dosing range, cumulative adverse effects on reproduction were seen in a continuous breeding study. A reduction in number of litters of the parental mating pair was observed as well as retarded growth and abnormal sperm in their offspring and reduced birth weight in the next generation <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in respiratory depression and physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms and signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.5">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Neonatal seizures, neonatal withdrawal syndrome, fetal death and stillbirth have been reported with tramadol hydrochloride during postmarketing.</paragraph>

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta. The mean ratio of serum tramadol in the umbilical veins compared to maternal veins was 0.83 for 40 women given tramadol during labor.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The effect of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, if any, on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in the progeny of rats treated orally with tramadol and acetaminophen. The tramadol/acetaminophen combination product was shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats at a maternally toxic dose, 50/434 mg/kg tramadol/acetaminophen (1.6 times the maximum daily human tramadol/acetaminophen dosage), but was not teratogenic at this dose level. Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted of decreased fetal weights and increased supernumerary ribs. Tramadol has been shown to be embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice, (120 mg/kg), rats (25 mg/kg) and rabbits (75 mg/kg) at maternally toxic dosages, but was not teratogenic at these dose levels. These doses on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis are 1.9, 0.8, and 4.9 times the maximum recommended human daily dosage (MRHD) for mouse, rat and rabbit, respectively. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>No drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in progeny of mice (up to 140 mg/kg), rats (up to 80 mg/kg) or rabbits (up to 300 mg/kg) treated with tramadol by various routes. Embryo and fetal toxicity consisted primarily of decreased fetal weights, skeletal ossification and increased supernumerary ribs at maternally toxic dose levels. Transient delays in developmental or behavioral parameters were also seen in pups from rat dams allowed to deliver. Embryo and fetal lethality were reported only in one rabbit study at 300 mg/kg, a dose that would cause extreme maternal toxicity in the rabbit. The dosages listed for mouse, rat and rabbit are 2.3, 2.6, and 19 times the MRHD, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol alone was evaluated in peri- and post-natal studies in rats. Progeny of dams receiving oral (gavage) dose levels of 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 1.6 times the maximum daily human tramadol dosage) or greater had decreased weights, and pup survival was decreased early in lactation at 80 mg/kg (480 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 2.6 times the maximum daily human tramadol dosage).</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Studies in pregnant rats that received oral acetaminophen during organogenesis at doses up to 1.3 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD = 2.6 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison) showed evidence of fetotoxicity (reduced fetal weight and length) and a dose-related increase in bone variations (reduced ossification and rudimentary rib changes). Offspring had no evidence of external, visceral, or skeletal malformations.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>When pregnant rats received oral acetaminophen throughout gestation at doses of 1.9-times the MHDD (based on a body surface area comparison), areas of necrosis occurred in both the liver and kidney of pregnant rats and fetuses. These effects did not occur in animals that received oral acetaminophen at doses 0.5-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In a continuous breeding study, pregnant mice received 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0% acetaminophen via the diet (357, 715, or 1430 mg/kg/day). These doses are approximately 0.7, 1.3, and 2.7 times the MHDD, respectively, based on a body surface area comparison. A dose-related reduction in body weights of fourth and fifth litter offspring of the treated mating pair occurred during lactation and post-weaning at all doses. Animals in the high dose group had a reduced number of litters per mating pair, male offspring with an increased percentage of abnormal sperm, and reduced birth weights in the next generation pups.<content ID="bookmark34"/>

                        <paragraph>Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen is not recommended for obstetrical preoperative medication or for post-delivery analgesia in nursing mothers because its safety in infants and newborns has not been studied.<br/>
                           <br/>Tramadol and its metabolite, <content styleCode="italics">O</content>-desmethyltramadol (M1), are present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. The M1 metabolite is more potent than tramadol in mu opioid receptor binding <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_12.1">Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)</linkHtml>]. </content>Published studies have reported tramadol and M1 in colostrum with administration of tramadol to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. Women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of tramadol may have higher than expected serum levels of M1, potentially leading to higher levels of M1 in breast milk that can be dangerous in their breastfed infants. In women with normal tramadol metabolism, the amount of tramadol secreted into human milk is low and dose-dependent. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Elderly patients (65 years of age or older) may have increased sensitivity to tramadol. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function.<content ID="bookmark38"/>

                     <title>9.2 Abuse</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablet contains tramadol, a substance with potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.<br/>
                           <br/> Misuse and abuse of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen with alcohol and other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction.<br/>
                           <br/> All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing tramadol, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in combination with other abused drugs.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>When discontinuing tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, gradually taper the dosage using a patient specific plan that considers the following: the dose of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_2.4">Dosage and Administration (2.5)</linkHtml>, and <linkHtml href="#Section_5.20">Warnings and Precautions (5.21)</linkHtml>]. </content>

                  <paragraph>Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen is a combination drug. The clinical presentation of overdose may include the signs and symptoms of tramadol toxicity, acetaminophen toxicity or both. The initial symptoms of tramadol overdosage may include respiratory depression and/or seizures. The initial symptoms seen within the first 24 hours following an acetaminophen overdose are: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, malaise, pallor and diaphoresis.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Acute overdosage with tramadol can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and, in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, QT prolongation, hypotension, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, seizures, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of tramadol <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.

Renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and thrombocytopenia also occur. Plasma acetaminophen levels &gt;300 mcg/mL at 4 hours after oral ingestion were associated with hepatic damage in 90% of patients; minimal hepatic damage is anticipated if plasma levels at 4 hours are &lt;150 mcg/mL or &lt;37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours after ingestion. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose may include: nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and general malaise. Clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48 to 72 hours post-ingestion.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>A single or multiple drug overdose with tramadol and acetaminophen is a potentially lethal polydrug overdose. Immediate treatment includes support of cardiorespiratory function and measures to reduce drug absorption. Oxygen, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, assisted ventilation, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated. Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center (where available) to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose.<br/>

                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>While naloxone will reverse some, but not all, symptoms caused by overdosage with tramadol, the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration. In animals, convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen could be suppressed with barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone. Naloxone administration did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice. Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an overdose because it removes less than 7% of the administered dose in a 4-hour dialysis period.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of tramadol in tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.<br/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>If an acetaminophen overdose is suspected, obtain a serum acetaminophen assay as soon as possible, but no sooner than 4 hours following oral ingestion. Obtain liver function studies initially and repeat at 24-hour intervals. Administer the antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as early as possible. As a guide to treatment of acute ingestion, the acetaminophen level can be plotted against time since oral ingestion on a nomogram Rumack-Matthew). The lower toxic line on the nomogram is equivalent to 150 mcg/mL at 4 hours and 37.5 mcg/mL at 12 hours. If serum level is above the lower line, administer the entire course of NAC treatment. Withhold NAC therapy if the acetaminophen level is below the lower line.<br/>
                     <br/> Serum acetaminophen levels should be obtained immediately if the patient presents 4 hours or more after ingestion to assess potential risk of hepatotoxicity; acetaminophen levels drawn less than 4 hours post-ingestion may be misleading. To obtain the best possible outcome, NAC should be administered as soon as possible where impending or evolving liver injury is suspected. Intravenous NAC may be administered when circumstances preclude oral administration.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Vigorous supportive therapy is required in severe intoxication. Procedures to limit the continuing absorption of the drug must be readily performed since the hepatic injury is dose-dependent and occurs early in the course of intoxication.<content ID="bookmark46"/>

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets contain tramadol, an opioid agonist and inhibitor of norepinephrine and serotonin re-uptake, and acetaminophen. Although the mode of action of tramadol is not completely understood, the analgesic effect of tramadol is believed to be due to both binding to µ-opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Opioid activity of tramadol is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the <content styleCode="italics">O</content>-demethylated metabolite M1 to µ-opioid receptors. In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ-opioid binding. Tramadol-induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests. The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>, as have some other opioid analgesics. These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Acetaminophen is a non-opioid, non-salicylate analgesic. The site and mechanism for the analgesic effect of acetaminophen has not been determined but is thought to primarily involve central actions.<content ID="bookmark49"/>

                        <paragraph>Tramadol produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tramadol causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tramadol causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation. Other opioid- induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of oral tramadol on the QTcF interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, four-way crossover, placebo- and positive- (moxifloxacin) controlled study in 68 adult male and female healthy subjects. At a 600 mg/day dose (1.5-fold the maximum immediate-release daily dose), the study demonstrated no significant effect on the QTcF interval. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys. The mean (SD) apparent total clearance of tramadol after a single 37.5 mg dose is 588 (226) mL/min for the (+) isomer and 736 (244) mL/min for the (-) isomer. The plasma elimination half-lives of racemic tramadol and M1 are approximately 5 to 6 and 7 hours, respectively, after administration of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen. The apparent plasma elimination half-life of racemic tramadol increased to 7 to 9 hours upon multiple dosing of tramadol hydrochloride and acetaminophen.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The half-life of acetaminophen is about 2 to 3 hours in adults. It is somewhat shorter in children and somewhat longer in neonates and in cirrhotic patients. Acetaminophen is eliminated from the body primarily by formation of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in a dose dependent manner.<br/>

                        <paragraph>Following oral administration, tramadol is extensively metabolized by a number of pathways, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, as well as by conjugation of parent and metabolites. The major metabolic pathways appear to be <content styleCode="italics">N</content>- and <content styleCode="italics">O</content>-demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver. Metabolite M1 (<content styleCode="italics">O</content>-desmethyltramadol) is pharmacologically active in animal models. Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition, which may affect the therapeutic response <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_7">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 7% of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P450. These individuals are “poor metabolizers” of debrisoquine, dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants, among other drugs. Based on a population PK analysis of Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20% higher in “poor metabolizers” versus “extensive metabolizers,” while M1 concentrations were 40% lower. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine, amitriptyline, and quinidine inhibit the metabolism of tramadol to various degrees. The full pharmacological impact of these alterations in terms of either efficacy or safety is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized in the liver by first-order kinetics and involves three principal separate pathways:</paragraph>

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>c) oxidation via the cytochrome, P450-dependent, mixed-function oxidase enzyme pathway to form a reactive intermediate metabolite, which conjugates with glutathione and is then further metabolized to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. The principal cytochrome P450 isoenzyme involved appears to be CYP2E1, with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 as additional pathways.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In adults, the majority of acetaminophen is conjugated with glucuronic acid and, to a lesser extent, with sulfate.

                        <paragraph>Pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment after receiving multiple doses of tramadol extended-release 100 mg. The exposure of (+)-and (‑)-­tramadol was similar in mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients in comparison to patients with normal hepatic function. However, exposure of (+)- and (-)-M1 decreased ~50% with increased severity of the hepatic impairment (from normal to mild and moderate). The pharmacokinetics of tramadol after the administration of tramadol extended-release has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. After the administration of tramadol immediate-release tablets to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, tramadol area under the plasma concentration time curve was larger and the tramadol and M1 half-lives were longer than subjects with normal hepatic function <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_8.6">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite, M1. The pharmacokinetics of tramadol were studied in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment after receiving multiple doses of tramadol extended-release 100 mg. There is no consistent trend observed for tramadol exposure related to renal function in patients with mild (CLcr: 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate (CLcr: 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function. However, exposure of M1 increased 20 to 40% with increased severity of the renal impairment (from normal to mild and moderate). Tramadol extended-release has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt;30 mL/min). The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4-hour dialysis period is less than 7% of the administered dose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_2.3">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Section_8.7">Use in Specific Populations (8.7)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no animal or laboratory studies on the combination product (tramadol and acetaminophen) to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility. Data on the individual components are described below.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A slight but statistically significant increase in two common murine tumors, pulmonary and hepatic, was observed in an NMRI mouse carcinogenicity study, particularly in aged mice. Mice were dosed orally up to 30 mg/kg in the drinking water (0.5 times the maximum recommended daily human dosage or MRHD) for approximately two years, although the study was not done with the Maximum Tolerated Dose. This finding is not believed to suggest risk in humans. No evidence of carcinogenicity was noted in a rat 2-year carcinogenicity study testing oral doses of up to 30 mg/kg in the drinking water (1 times the MRHD).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6000 ppm. Female rats demonstrated equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia at 1.2 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 2.6 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison. In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats (1.1 times) or mice (1.9 to 2.2 times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison).</paragraph>

In contrast, acetaminophen tested positive for induction of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> assays using Chinese hamster ovary cells. In the published literature, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic when administered a dose of 1500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison). In contrast, no clastogenicity was noted at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (2.8-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison), suggesting a threshold effect.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg/kg in male rats and 75 mg/kg in female rats.

                        <paragraph>In studies of acetaminophen conducted by the National Toxicology Program, fertility assessments have been completed in Swiss mice via a continuous breeding study. There were no effects on fertility parameters in mice consuming up to 1.7 times the MHDD of acetaminophen, based on a body surface area comparison. Although there was no effect on sperm motility or sperm density in the epididymis, there was a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm in mice consuming 1.7 times the MHDD (based on a body surface area comparison) and there was a reduction in the number of mating pairs producing a fifth litter at this dose, suggesting the potential for cumulative toxicity with chronic administration of acetaminophen near the upper limit of daily dosing.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Published studies in rodents report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface area comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced spermatogenesis, reduced fertility, and reduced implantation sites in females given the same doses. These effects appear to increase with the duration of treatment. The clinical significance of these findings is not known.<content ID="bookmark53"/>
