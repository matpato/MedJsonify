                        <paragraph>Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal nervous system affecting the mobility and control of the skeletal muscular system. Its characteristic features include resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinetic movements. Symptomatic treatments, such as levodopa therapies, may permit the patient better mobility.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Current evidence indicates that symptoms of Parkinson's disease are related to depletion of dopamine in the corpus striatum. Administration of dopamine is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease apparently because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. However, levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, does cross the blood-brain barrier, and presumably is converted to dopamine in the brain. This is thought to be the mechanism whereby levodopa relieves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>When levodopa is administered orally, it is rapidly decarboxylated to dopamine in extracerebral tissues so that only a small portion of a given dose is transported unchanged to the central nervous system. For this reason, large doses of levodopa are required for adequate therapeutic effect, and these may often be accompanied by nausea and other adverse reactions, some of which are attributable to dopamine formed in extracerebral tissues.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Since levodopa competes with certain amino acids for transport across the gut wall, the absorption of levodopa may be impaired in some patients on a high protein diet.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carbidopa inhibits decarboxylation of peripheral levodopa. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier and does not affect the metabolism of levodopa within the central nervous system.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Since its decarboxylase inhibiting activity is limited to extracerebral tissues, administration of carbidopa with levodopa makes more levodopa available for transport to the brain.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients treated with levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease may develop motor fluctuations characterized by end-of-dose failure, peak dose dyskinesia, and akinesia. The advanced form of motor fluctuations (‘on-off’ phenomenon) is characterized by unpredictable swings from mobility to immobility. Although the causes of the motor fluctuations are not completely understood, in some patients they may be attenuated by treatment regimens that produce steady plasma levels of levodopa.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets contains either 25 mg of carbidopa and 100 mg of levodopa, or 50 mg of carbidopa and 200 mg of levodopa in a extended-release dosage form designed to release these ingredients over a 4- to 6-hour period. With carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets there is less variation in plasma levodopa levels than with carbidopa and levodopa tablets, the conventional formulation. 
  <content styleCode="italics">However, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are less systemically bioavailable than carbidopa and levodopa tablets and may require increased daily doses to achieve the same level of symptomatic relief as provided by carbidopa and levodopa tablets.</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials, patients with moderate to severe motor fluctuations who received carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets 
  <content styleCode="italics">did not experience quantitatively significant reductions</content>in ‘off’ time when compared to carbidopa and levodopa tablets. However, global ratings of improvement as assessed by both patient and physician were better during therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets than with carbidopa and levodopa tablets. In patients without motor fluctuations, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets, under controlled conditions, provided the same therapeutic benefit with less frequent dosing when compared to carbidopa and levodopa tablets.

                        <paragraph>Carbidopa reduces the amount of levodopa required to produce a given response by about 75% and, when administered with levodopa, increases both plasma levels and the plasma half-life of levodopa, and decreases plasma and urinary dopamine and homovanillic acid.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elimination half-life of levodopa in the presence of carbidopa is about 1.5 hours. Following carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets, the apparent half-life of levodopa may be prolonged because of continuous absorption.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy elderly subjects (56 to 67 years old) the mean time-to-peak concentration of levodopa after a single dose of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets 50 mg/200 mg was about 2 hours as compared to 0.5 hours after standard carbidopa and levodopa tablets. The maximum concentration of levodopa after a single dose of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets was about 35% of the standard carbidopa and levodopa tablets (1,151 vs. 3,256 ng/mL). The extent of availability of levodopa from carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets was about 70% to 75% relative to intravenous levodopa or standard carbidopa and levodopa tablets in the elderly. The absolute bioavailability of levodopa from carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets (relative to I.V.) in young subjects was shown to be only about 44%. The extent of availability and the peak concentrations of levodopa were comparable in the elderly after a single dose and at steady state after t.i.d. administration of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets 50 mg/200 mg. In elderly subjects, the average trough levels of levodopa at steady state after the extended-release tablet were about 2 fold higher than after the standard carbidopa and levodopa tablets (163 vs. 74 ng/mL).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these studies, using similar total daily doses of levodopa, plasma levodopa concentrations with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets fluctuated in a narrower range than with carbidopa and levodopa tablets. Because the bioavailability of levodopa from carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets relative to carbidopa and levodopa tablets is approximately 70% to 75%, the daily dosage of levodopa necessary to produce a given clinical response with the sustained-release formulation will usually be higher.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The extent of availability and peak concentrations of levodopa after a single dose of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets 50 mg/200 mg increased by about 50% and 25%, respectively, when administered with food.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At steady state, the bioavailability of carbidopa from carbidopa and levodopa tablet is approximately 99% relative to the concomitant administration of carbidopa and levodopa. At steady state, carbidopa bioavailability from carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets 50 mg/200 mg is approximately 58% relative to that from carbidopa and levodopa tablets.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B 
  <sub>6</sub>), in oral doses of 10 mg to 25 mg, may reverse the effects of levodopa by increasing the rate of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation. Carbidopa inhibits this action of pyridoxine.

Based on another study in forty patients with Parkinson’s disease, there was a correlation between age of patients and the increase of AUC of levodopa following administration of levodopa and an inhibitor of peripheral dopa decarboxylase.

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients taking carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets alone or with other dopaminergic drugs have reported suddenly falling asleep without prior warning of sleepiness while engaged in activities of daily living (includes operation of motor vehicles). Road traffic accidents attributed to sudden sleep onset have been reported. Although many patients reported somnolence while on dopaminergic medications, there have been reports of road traffic accidents attributed to sudden onset of sleep in which the patient did not perceive any warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Sudden onset of sleep has been reported to occur as long as one year after the initiation of treatment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in patients experiencing preexisting somnolence, although some patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets. Patients who have already experienced somnolence or an episode of sudden sleep onset should not participate in these activities during treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Before initiating treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets, advise patients about the potential to develop drowsiness and ask specifically about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets such as the use of concomitant sedating medications and the presence of sleep disorders. Consider discontinuing carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets in patients who report significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.). If treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets continues, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reductions or withdrawal of certain antiparkinsonian agents such as levodopa, carbidopa and levodopa, and carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia. Neurological findings, including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes; other disturbances, such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper-or hypotension; laboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin have been reported.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene, are often used in the treatment of NMS; however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  Hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior have been reported with dopaminergic medications. In general, hallucinations present shortly after the initiation of therapy and may be responsive to dose reduction in levodopa. Hallucinations may be accompanied by confusion and to a lesser extent sleep disorder (insomnia) and excessive dreaming.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets may have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior may present with one or more symptoms, including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ordinarily, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets, because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and may decrease the effectiveness of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Reports of patients taking dopaminergic medications (medications that increase central dopaminergic tone), suggest that patients may experience an intense urge to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or the caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets [see

                        <paragraph>The patient should be informed that carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets is an extended-release formulation of carbidopa and levodopa which releases these ingredients over a 4 to 6 hour period. It is important that carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets be taken at regular intervals according to the schedule outlined by the physician. The patient should be cautioned not to change the prescribed dosage regimen and not to add any additional antiparkinson medications, including other carbidopa and levodopa preparations, without first consulting the physician.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If abnormal involuntary movements appear or get worse during treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets, the physician should be notified, as dosage adjustment may be necessary.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be advised that sometimes the onset of effect of the first morning dose of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets may be delayed for up to one hour compared with the response usually obtained from the first morning dose of carbidopa and levodopa tablets. The physician should be notified if such delayed responses pose a problem in treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be advised that, occasionally, dark color (red, brown, or black) may appear in saliva, urine, or sweat after ingestion of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets. Although the color appears to be clinically insignificant, garments may become discolored.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The patient should be advised that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay the absorption of levodopa and may reduce the amount taken up in the circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying, thus delaying the absorption of levodopa. Iron salts (such as in multivitamin tablets) may also reduce the amount of levodopa available to the body. The above factors may reduce the clinical effectiveness of the levodopa or carbidopa and levodopa therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients must be advised that the whole or half tablet should be swallowed without chewing or crushing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be alerted to the possibility of sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, when they are taking dopaminergic agents, including levodopa. Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machinery and that if they have experienced somnolence and/or sudden sleep onset, they must refrain from these activities.

                                 <br/>  No teratogenic effects were observed in a study in mice receiving up to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa and levodopa tablets. There was a decrease in the number of live pups delivered by rats receiving approximately two times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa and approximately five times the maximum recommended human dose of levodopa during organogenesis. Carbidopa and levodopa tablets caused both visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits at all doses and ratios of carbidopa/levodopa tested, which ranged from 10 times/5 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa/levodopa to 20 times/10 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa/levodopa.

                              <paragraph>There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It has been reported from individual cases that levodopa crosses the human placental barrier, enters the fetus, and is metabolized. Carbidopa concentrations in fetal tissue appeared to be minimal. Use of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the drug be weighed against possible hazards to mother and child.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the clinical efficacy trials for carbidopa and levodopa tablets, almost half of the patients were older than 65, but few were older than 75. No overall meaningful differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to adverse drug reactions such as hallucinations cannot be ruled out. There is no specific dosing recommendation based upon clinical pharmacology data as carbidopa and levodopa tablets and carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are titrated as tolerated for clinical effect.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Management of acute overdosage with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablet is the same as with levodopa. Pyridoxine is not effective in reversing the actions of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>General supportive measures should be employed, along with immediate gastric lavage. Intravenous fluids should be administered judiciously and an adequate airway maintained. Electrocardiographic monitoring should be instituted and the patient carefully observed for the development of arrhythmias; if required, appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy should be given. The possibility that the patient may have taken other drugs as well as carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should be taken into consideration. To date, no experience has been reported with dialysis; hence, its value in overdosage is not known.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Based on studies in which high doses of levodopa and/or carbidopa were administered, a significant proportion of rats and mice given single oral doses of levodopa of approximately 1,500 mg/kg to 2,000 mg/kg are expected to die. A significant proportion of infant rats of both sexes are expected to die at a dose of 800 mg/kg. A significant proportion of rats are expected to die after treatment with similar doses of carbidopa. The addition of carbidopa in a 1:10 ratio with levodopa increases the dose at which a significant proportion of mice are expected to die to 3,360 mg/kg.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets contain carbidopa and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio as either the 50 mg/200 mg tablet or the 25 mg/100 mg tablet. The daily dosage of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets must be determined by careful titration. Patients should be monitored closely during the dose adjustment period, particularly with regard to appearance or worsening of involuntary movements, dyskinesias or nausea. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets should not be chewed or crushed.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Standard drugs for Parkinson’s disease, other than levodopa without a decarboxylase inhibitor, may be used concomitantly while carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are being administered, although their dosage may have to be adjusted.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Since carbidopa prevents the reversal of levodopa effects caused by pyridoxine, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets can be given to patients receiving supplemental pyridoxine (vitamin B
 
  <sub>6</sub>).

                        <paragraph>Sporadic cases of hyperpyrexia and confusion have been associated with dose reductions and withdrawal of carbidopa and levodopa tablets or carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be observed carefully if abrupt reduction or discontinuation of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets is required, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics (see
 
  <linkHtml href="#s5">WARNINGS</linkHtml>).

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If general anesthesia is required, carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets may be continued as long as the patient is permitted to take oral medication. If therapy is interrupted temporarily, the patient should be observed for symptoms resembling NMS, and the usual dosage should be administered as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication.</paragraph>
