                           <br/>  After observing the response to initial therapy with indomethacin, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient’s needs. 
  <br/>  Adverse reactions generally appear to correlate with the dose of indomethacin. Therefore, every effort should be made to determine the lowest effective dosage for the individual patient.

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Indomethacin immediate-release capsules, 25 mg twice a day or three times a day. If this is well tolerated, increase the daily dosage by 25 mg or by 50 mg, if required by continuing symptoms, at weekly intervals until a satisfactory response is obtained or until a total daily dose of 150 to 200 mg is reached. Doses above this amount generally do not increase the effectiveness of the drug. 
  <br/>  In patients who have persistent night pain and/or morning stiffness, the giving of a large portion, up to a maximum of 100 mg, of the total daily dose at bedtime may be helpful in affording relief. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it may be necessary to increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily. 
  <br/>  If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to a tolerated dose and observe the patient closely. 
  <br/>  If severe adverse reactions occur, stop the drug. After the acute phase of the disease is under control, an attempt to reduce the daily dose should be made repeatedly until the patient is receiving the smallest effective dose or the drug is discontinued. 
  <br/>  Careful instructions to, and observations of, the individual patient are essential to the prevention of serious, irreversible, including fatal, adverse reactions. 
  <br/>  As advancing years appear to increase the possibility of adverse reactions, indomethacin extended-release capsules should be used with greater care in the elderly

                     <title>5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</title>
                     <text>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. 
  <br/>  To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 
  <br/>  There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as indomethacin, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events

                           <br/>  Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG

                           <br/>  Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. 
  <br/>  Avoid the use of indomethacin extended-release capsules in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If indomethacin extended-release capsules are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including indomethacin, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs.  Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation</content>
                           <br/>  Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:</content>
                           <br/>  • Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. 
  <br/>  • Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. 
  <br/>  • Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. 
  <br/>  • Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. 
  <br/>  • If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue indomethacin extended-release capsules until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. 
  <br/>  • In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding

                     <text>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Renal Toxicity</content>
                           <br/>  Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. 
  <br/>  Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly.  Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. 
  <br/>  No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of indomethacin extended-release capsules in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of indomethacin extended-release capsules may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. 
  <br/>  Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating indomethacin extended-release capsules. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of indomethacin extended-release capsules

  </content>. Avoid the use of indomethacin extended-release capsules in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If indomethacin extended-release capsules are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. 
  <br/>  It has been reported that the addition of the potassium-sparing diuretic, triamterene, to a maintenance schedule of indomethacin resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteers. Indomethacin and triamterene should not be administered together. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Hyperkalemia</content>
                           <br/>  Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 
  <br/>  Both Indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. The potential effects of indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium levels and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.

                        <paragraph>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as indomethacin extended-release capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue indomethacin extended-release capsules and evaluate the patient immediately.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  Avoid use of NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks gestation and later. NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age.  
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment</content>
                           <br/>  Use of NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. 
  <br/>  Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. 
  <br/>  If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit indomethacin extended-release capsules use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if indomethacin extended-release capsules treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue indomethacin extended-release capsules if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice

                        <paragraph>Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with indomethacin extended-release capsules has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. 
  <br/>  NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions, such as coagulation disorders, or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. 
  <br/>  In a gastroscopic study in 45 healthy subjects, the number of gastric mucosal abnormalities was significantly higher in the group receiving indomethacin immediate-release capsules than in the group taking indomethacin suppositories or placebo. 
  <br/>  In a double-blind comparative clinical study involving 175 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, however, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse effects with indomethacin immediate-release capsules or suppositories was comparable. The incidence of lower gastrointestinal adverse effects was greater in the suppository group. 
  <br/>  The adverse reactions for indomethacin immediate-release capsules listed in the following table have been arranged into two groups: (1) incidence greater than 1%; and (2) incidence less than 1%. The incidence for group (1) was obtained from 33 double-blind controlled clinical trials reported in the literature (1,092 patients). The incidence for group (2) was based on reports in clinical trials, in the literature, and on voluntary reports since marketing. The probability of a causal relationship exists between indomethacin capsules and these adverse reactions, some of which have been reported only rarely. 
  <br/>  The adverse reactions reported with indomethacin immediate-release capsules may occur with use of the suppositories. In addition, rectal irritation and tenesmus have been reported in patients who have received the capsules.

This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.

     <br/>  It has been reported that the addition of triamterene to a maintenance schedule of indomethacin extended-release capsules resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteers. Indomethacin extended-release capsules and triamterene should not be administered together.

The potential effects of indomethacin extended-release capsules and potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium levels and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.

                     <br/>  Indomethacin reduces basal plasma renin activity (PRA), as well as those elevations of PRA induced by furosemide administration, or salt or volume depletion. These facts should be considered when evaluating plasma renin activity in hypertensive patients. 
  <br/>  False-negative results in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in patients being treated with indomethacin have been reported. Thus, results of the DST should be interpreted with caution in these patients.

                           <br/>  Use of NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Because of these risks, limit dose and duration of indomethacin extended-release capsules use between about 20 and 30 weeks of gestation, and avoid indomethacin extended-release capsules use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy

                           <br/>  Use of NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, at about 30 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment</content>
                           <br/>  Use of NSAIDs at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy has been associated with cases of fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. 
  <br/>  Data from observational studies regarding other potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies retarded fetal ossification was observed with administration of indomethacin to mice and rats during organogenesis at doses 0.1 and 0.2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD, 200 mg). In published studies in pregnant mice, indomethacin produced maternal toxicity and death, increased fetal resorptions, and fetal malformations at 0.1 times the MRHD. When rat and mice dams were dosed during the last three days of gestation, indomethacin produced neuronal necrosis in the offspring at 0.1 and 0.05 times the MRHD, respectively [see Data]. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as indomethacin, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.  
  <br/>  The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

                           <br/>  Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: 
  <br/>  Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data). 
  <br/>  Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment 
  <br/>  If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If indomethacin extended-release capsules treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue indomethacin extended-release capsules and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

                           <br/>  Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: 
  <br/>  Published literature reports that the use of NSAIDs at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. 
  <br/>  Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: 
  <br/>  Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis. 
  <br/>  Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Animal data</content>
                           <br/>  Reproductive studies were conducted in mice and rats at dosages of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg/day.  Except for retarded fetal ossification at 4 mg/kg/day (0.1 times [mice] and 0.2 times [rats] the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis, respectively) considered secondary to the decreased average fetal weights, no increase in fetal malformations was observed as compared with control groups.  Other studies in mice reported in the literature using higher doses (5 to 15 mg/kg/day, 0.1 to 0.4 times MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis) have described maternal toxicity and death, increased fetal resorptions, and fetal malformations. 
  <br/>  In rats and mice, maternal indomethacin administration of 4 mg/kg/day (0.2 times and 0.1 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis) during the last 3 days of gestation was associated with an increased incidence of neuronal necrosis in the diencephalon in the live-born fetuses however no increase in neuronal necrosis was observed at 2 mg/kg/day as compared to the control groups (0.1 times and 0.05 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).  Administration of 0.5 or 4 mg/kg/day to offspring during the first 3 days of life did not cause an increase in neuronal necrosis at either dose level. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Labor or Delivery</content>
                           <br/>  There are no studies on the effects of indomethacin extended-release capsules during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including indomethacin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

                           <br/>  Based on available published clinical data, indomethacin may be present in human milk.  The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for indomethacin extended-release capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the indomethacin extended-release capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Data</content>
                           <br/>  In one study, levels of indomethacin in breast milk were below the sensitivity of the assay (&lt;20 mcg/L) in 11 of 15 women using doses ranging from 75 mg orally to 300 mg rectally daily (0.94 to 4.29 mg/kg daily) in the postpartum period. Based on these levels, the average concentration present in breast milk was estimated to be 0.27% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose. In another study indomethacin levels were measured in breast milk of eight postpartum women using doses of 75 mg daily and the results were used to calculate an estimated infant daily dose. The estimated infant dose of indomethacin from breast milk was less than 30 mcg/day or 4.5 mcg/kg/day assuming breast milk intake of 150 mL/kg/day. This is 0.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage or about 3% of the neonatal dose for treatment of patent ductus arteriosus.

                           <br/>  Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including indomethacin extended-release capsules, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

                        <paragraph>Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients  14 years  of  age  and  younger  has  not  been established. 
  <br/>  Indomethacin extended-release capsules should not be prescribed for pediatric patients 14 years of age and younger unless toxicity or lack of efficacy associated with other drugs warrants the risk. 
  <br/>  In experience with more than 900 pediatric patients reported in the literature or to the manufacturer who were treated with indomethacin immediate-release capsules, side effects in pediatric patients were comparable to those reported in adults. Experience in pediatric patients has been confined to the use of indomethacin immediate-release capsules. 
  <br/>  If a decision is made to use indomethacin for pediatric patients two years of age or older, such patients should be monitored closely and periodic assessment of liver function is recommended. There have been cases of hepatotoxicity reported in pediatric patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, including fatalities. If indomethacin treatment is instituted, a suggested starting dose is 1 to 2 mg/kg/day given in divided doses. Maximum daily dosage should not exceed 3 mg/kg/day or 150 to 200 mg/day, whichever is less. Limited data are available to support the use of a maximum daily dosage of 4 mg/kg/day or 150 to 200 mg/day, whichever is less. As symptoms subside, the total daily dosage should be reduced to the lowest level required to control symptoms, or the drug should be discontinued.

                     <br/>  Manage patients with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.  
  <br/>  For additional information about overdosage treatment contact a poison control center (1-800-222-1222).

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Indomethacin has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. 
  <br/>  The mechanism of action of indomethacin extended-release capsules, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). 
  <br/>  Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Indomethacin concentrations reached during therapy have produced
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content>effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because indomethacin is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Absorption</content>
                           <br/>  Following single oral doses of indomethacin immediate-release capsules 25 mg or 50 mg, indomethacin is readily absorbed, attaining peak plasma concentrations of about 1 and 2 mcg/mL, respectively, at about 2 hours. Orally administered indomethacin immediate- release capsules are virtually 100% bioavailable, with 90% of the dose absorbed within 4 hours. A single 50 mg dose of indomethacin oral suspension was found to be bioequivalent to a 50 mg indomethacin Capsule when each was administered with food.  With a typical therapeutic regimen of 25 or 50 mg three times a day, the steady-state plasma concentrations of indomethacin are an average 1.4 times those following the first dose. 
  <br/>  Indomethacin extended-release capsules 75 mg are designed to release 25 mg of the drug initially and the remaining 50 mg over approximately 12 hours (90% of dose absorbed by 12 hours). When measured over a 24-hour period, the cumulative amount and time-course of indomethacin absorption from a single indomethacin extended-release capsule are comparable to those of 3 doses of 25 mg indomethacin immediate-release capsules given at 4 to 6 hour intervals 
  <br/>  Plasma concentrations of indomethacin fluctuate less and are more sustained following administration of indomethacin extended-release capsules than following administration of 25 mg indomethacin immediate-release capsules given at 4 to 6 hour intervals. In multiple-dose comparisons, the mean daily steady-state plasma level of indomethacin attained with daily administration of indomethacin extended-release capsules 75 mg was indistinguishable from that following indomethacin immediate-release capsules 25 mg given at 0, 6 and 12 hours daily. However, there was a significant difference in indomethacin plasma levels between the two dosage regimens especially after 12 hours. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Distribution</content>
                           <br/>  Indomethacin is highly bound to protein in plasma (about 99%) over the expected range of therapeutic plasma concentrations. Indomethacin has been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and the placenta, and appears in breast milk.

                           <content styleCode="italics">Metabolism</content>
                           <br/>  Indomethacin exists in the plasma as the parent drug and its desmethyl, desbenzoyl, and desmethyldesbenzoyl metabolites, all in the unconjugated form. Appreciable formation of glucuronide conjugates of each metabolite and of indomethacin are formed. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Excretion</content>
                           <br/>  Indomethacin is eliminated via renal excretion, metabolism, and biliary excretion. Indomethacin undergoes appreciable enterohepatic circulation.  About 60% of an oral dose is recovered in urine as drug and metabolites (26% as indomethacin and its glucuronide), and 33% is recovered in feces (1.5% as indomethacin).  The mean half-life of indomethacin is estimated to be about 4.5 hours.

                  <paragraph>Indomethacin has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory agent, appropriate for long-term use in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and osteoarthritis. 
  <br/>  Indomethacin extended-release capsules affords relief of symptoms; it does not alter the progressive course of the underlying disease. 
  <br/>  Indomethacin extended-release capsules suppresses inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis as demonstrated by relief of pain, and reduction of fever, swelling and tenderness. Improvement in patients treated with indomethacin for rheumatoid arthritis has been demonstrated by a reduction in joint swelling, average number of joints involved, and morning stiffness; by increased mobility as demonstrated by a decrease in walking time; and by improved functional capability as demonstrated by an increase in grip strength. Indomethacin extended-release capsules may enable the reduction of steroid dosage in patients receiving steroids for the more severe forms of rheumatoid arthritis. In such instances the steroid dosage should be reduced slowly and the patients followed very closely for any possible adverse effects.
