                  <paragraph>Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals is a larger crystal form of nitrofurantoin. The absorption of nitrofurantoin macrocrystals is slower and its excretion somewhat less when compared to nitrofurantoin. Blood concentrations at therapeutic dosage are usually low. It is highly soluble in urine, to which it may impart a brown color. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following a dose regimen of 100 mg q.i.d. for 7 days, average urinary drug recoveries (0 to 24 hours) on day 1 and day 7 were 37.9% and 35%. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Unlike many drugs, the presence of food or agents delaying gastric emptying can increase the bioavailability of nitrofurantoin macrocrystals, presumably by allowing better dissolution in gastric juices.  </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mechanism of the antimicrobial action of nitrofurantoin is unusual among antibacterials. Nitrofurantoin is reduced by bacterial flavoproteins to reactive intermediates which inactivate or alter bacterial ribosomal proteins and other macromolecules. As a result of such inactivations, the vital biochemical processes of protein synthesis, aerobic energy metabolism, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell wall synthesis are inhibited. Nitrofurantoin is bactericidal in urine at therapeutic doses. The broad-based nature of this mode of action may explain the lack of acquired bacterial resistance to nitrofurantoin, as the necessary multiple and simultaneous mutations of the target macromolecules would likely be lethal to the bacteria. </paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules are specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections when due to susceptible strains of <content styleCode="italics">Escherichia coli</content>, enterococci, <content styleCode="italics">Staphylococcus aureus</content>, and certain susceptible strains of <content styleCode="italics">Klebsiella </content>and <content styleCode="italics">Enterobacter </content>species. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules and other antibacterial drugs, nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Anuria, oliguria, or significant impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance under 60 mL per minute or clinically significant elevated serum creatinine) are contraindications. Treatment of this type of patient carries an increased risk of toxicity because of impaired excretion of the drug. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because of the possibility of hemolytic anemia due to immature erythrocyte enzyme systems (glutathione instability), the drug is contraindicated in pregnant patients at term (38 to 42 weeks' gestation), during labor and delivery, or when the onset of labor is imminent. For the same reason, the drug is contraindicated in neonates under one month of age. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules are contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with nitrofurantoin. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules are also contraindicated in those patients with known hypersensitivity to nitrofurantoin. </paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Information for Patients: </content>Patients should be advised to take nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules with food to further enhance tolerance and improve drug absorption. Patients should be instructed to complete the full course of therapy; however, they should be advised to contact their physician if any unusual symptoms occur during therapy. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Many patients who cannot tolerate microcrystalline nitrofurantoin are able to take nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules without nausea. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be advised not to use antacid preparations containing magnesium trisilicate while taking nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. </paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">General: </content>Prescribing nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin.

In male F344/N rats, there were increased incidences of uncommon kidney tubular cell neoplasms, osteosarcomas of the bone, and neoplasms of the subcutaneous tissue. In one study involving subcutaneous administration of 75 mg/kg nitrofurantoin to pregnant female mice, lung papillary adenomas of unknown significance were observed in the F1 generation. </paragraph>

In a single published study conducted in mice at 68 times the human dose (based on mg/kg administered to the dam), growth retardation and a low incidence of minor and common malformations were observed. However, at 25 times the human dose, fetal malformations were not observed; the relevance of these findings to humans is uncertain. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. </paragraph>

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Spontaneous reports suggest a higher proportion of pulmonary reactions, including fatalities, in elderly patients; these differences appear to be related to the higher proportion of elderly patients receiving long-term nitrofurantoin therapy. As in younger patients, chronic pulmonary reactions generally are observed in patients receiving therapy for six months or longer (see <content styleCode="bold">

                  <paragraph>In general, the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy should be considered when prescribing nitrofurantoin macrocrystals capsules. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Anuria, oliguria, or significant impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance under 60 mL per minute or clinically significant elevated serum creatinine) are contraindications (see <content styleCode="bold">
