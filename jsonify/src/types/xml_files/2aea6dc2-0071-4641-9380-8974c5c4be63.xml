                  <paragraph ID="ID4">Doxycycline for injection, USP is an antibacterial drug synthetically derived from oxytetracycline, and is available as doxycycline hyclate (doxycycline hydrochloride hemiethanolate hemihydrate). The chemical designation of this yellow crystalline powder is (4S, 4aR, 5S, 5aR, 6R, 12 aS)-4-(Dimethylamino)-1,4,4a,5,5a,6,11,12a-octahydro-3,5,10,12,12a-pentahydroxy-6-methyl-1,11-dioxo-2-naphthacenecarboxamide monohydrochloride, compound with ethyl alcohol (2:1), monohydrate. Doxycycline has a high degree of lipid solubility and a low affinity for calcium binding. It is highly stable in normal human serum. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each 100 mg vial contains: Doxycycline hyclate equivalent to 100 mg doxycycline; ascorbic acid 480 mg; mannitol 300 mg.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph ID="ID6">Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>They are concentrated by the liver in the bile, and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following a single 100 mg dose administered in a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL in a one-hour infusion, normal adult volunteers averaged a peak of 2.5 mcg/mL, while 200 mg of a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL administered over two hours averaged a peak of 3.6 mcg/mL. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40 percent/72 hours in individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min). This percentage of excretion may fall as low as 1 to 5 percent/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min). Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18 to 22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Hemodialysis does not alter this serum half-life of doxycycline.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph ID="ID19">The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use doxycycline in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies.</paragraph>

Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of <content styleCode="italics">C. difficile</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="italics">C. difficile </content>produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of <content styleCode="italics">C. difficile </content>cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following the use of antibacterial drugs. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing use of antibacterial drugs not directed against <content styleCode="italics">C. difficile </content>may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of <content styleCode="italics">C. difficile</content>, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID29">Adverse Reactions</linkHtml>]</content>. If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately, and appropriate therapy should be instituted.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline for injection. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline for injection should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light, should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.</paragraph>

They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When doxycycline for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</paragraph>

If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph ID="ID43">Note: Rapid administration is to be avoided. Parenteral therapy is indicated only when oral therapy is not indicated. Oral therapy should be instituted as soon as possible. If intravenous therapy is given over prolonged periods of time, thrombophlebitis may result.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The usual dosage and frequency of administration of doxycycline for injection (100 to 200 mg/day) differs from that of the other tetracyclines (1 to 2 g/day). Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies to date have indicated that doxycycline for injection at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of doxycycline in patients with renal impairment. </paragraph>
