                  <paragraph>The recommended starting dose of memantine hydrochloride USP is 5 mg once daily. The dose should be increased in 5 mg increments to 10 mg/day (5 mg twice daily), 15 mg/day (5 mg and 10 mg as separate doses), and 20 mg/day (10 mg twice daily). The minimum recommended interval between dose increases is one week. The dosage shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials is 20 mg/day. 
  <br/>
                     <br/>  Memantine hydrochloride can be taken with or without food. If a patient misses a single dose of memantine hydrochloride, that patient should not double up on the next dose. The next dose should be taken as scheduled. 
  <br/>  If a patient fails to take memantine hydrochloride for several days, dosing may need to be resumed at lower doses and retitrated as described above.

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8. Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g. renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Memantine failed to demonstrate efficacy in two 12-week controlled clinical studies of 578 pediatric patients aged 6-12 years with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including autism, Asperger’s disorder and Pervasive Development Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Memantine has not been studied in pediatric patients under 6 years of age or over 12 years of age. Memantine treatment was initiated at 3 mg/day and the dose was escalated to the target dose (weight-based) by week 6. Oral doses of memantine 3, 6, 9, or 15 mg extended-release capsules were administered once daily to patients with weights &lt; 20 kg, 20-39 kg, 40-59 kg and ≥ 60 kg, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a randomized, 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study (Study A) in patients with autism, there was no statistically significant difference in the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total raw score between patients randomized to memantine (n=54) and those randomized to placebo (n=53). In a 12-week responder-enriched randomized withdrawal study (Study B) in 471 patients with ASD, there was no statistically significant difference in the loss of therapeutic response rates between patients randomized to remain on full-dose memantine (n=153) and those randomized to switch to placebo (n=158).</paragraph>

Because of early memantine-related mortality, the 30 and 45 mg/kg/day groups were terminated without further evaluation. Apoptosis or neuronal degeneration in the brain was observed on PNDs 8-17 at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose for apoptosis and neuronal degeneration was 8 mg/kg/day. In animals in which memantine (0, 1, 3, 8, or 15 mg/kg/day) was orally administered on PNDs 7-70, adverse neurobehavioral effects (increased locomotor motor activity, increased auditory startle response and decreased habituation, and deficit in learning and memory) were observed at all but the lowest dose tested. Effects on auditory startle persisted after drug discontinuation. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity was the lowest dose tested (1 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>

                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Signs and symptoms most often accompanying memantine overdosage in clinical trials and from worldwide marketing experience, alone or in combination with other drugs and/or alcohol, include agitation, asthenia, bradycardia, confusion, coma, dizziness, ECG changes, increased blood pressure, lethargy, loss of consciousness, psychosis, restlessness, slowed movement, somnolence, stupor, unsteady gait, visual hallucinations, vertigo, vomiting, and weakness. The largest known ingestion of memantine worldwide was 2.0 grams in a patient who took memantine in conjunction with unspecified antidiabetic medications. The patient experienced coma, diplopia, and agitation, but subsequently recovered. Fatal outcome has been very rarely reported with memantine, and the relationship to memantine was unclear. 
  <br/>
                     <br/>  Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a poison control center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug. As in any cases of overdose, general supportive measures should be utilized, and treatment should be symptomatic. Elimination of memantine can be enhanced by acidification of urine.

                        <paragraph>Persistent activation of central nervous system N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer’s disease. Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity uncompetitive (open-channel) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor-operated cation channels. There is no evidence that memantine prevents or slows neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  Following oral administration memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrations reached in about 3-7 hours. Memantine has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. Food has no effect on the absorption of memantine. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Distribution</content>
                           <br/>  The mean volume of distribution of memantine is 9-11 L/kg and the plasma protein binding is low (45%). 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Metabolism</content>
                           <br/>  Memantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism. The hepatic microsomal CYP450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of memantine. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Elimination</content>
                           <br/>  Memantine is excreted predominantly (about 48%) unchanged in urine and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 60-80 hours. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  The remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity: the N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy memantine, and 1-nitroso-deaminated memantine. A total of 74% of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N-glucuronide conjugate. Renal clearance involves active tubular secretion moderated by pH dependent tubular reabsorption. 
  <br/>

                           <br/>  Following multiple dose administration of memantine hydrochloride 20 mg daily, females had about 45% higher exposure than males, but there was no difference in exposure when body weight was taken into account. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Elderly</content>
                           <br/>  The pharmacokinetics of memantine hydrochloride in young and elderly subjects are similar. 
  <br/>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Renal Impairment</content>
                           <br/>  Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following single oral administration of 20 mg memantine hydrochloride in 8 subjects with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance, CLcr, &gt;50 – 80 mL/min), 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 – 49 mL/min), 7 subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr 5 – 29 mL/min) and 8 healthy subjects (CLcr &gt; 80 mL/min) matched as closely as possible by age, weight and gender to the subjects with renal impairment. Mean AUC
 
  <sub>0-∞</sub>increased by 4%, 60%, and 115% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The terminal elimination half-life increased by 18%, 41%, and 95% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. Dosage should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment

                           <br/>  Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following the administration of single oral doses of 20 mg in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) and 8 subjects who were age-, gender-, and weight-matched to the hepatically-impaired subjects. There was no change in memantine exposure (based on C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and AUC) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects. However, terminal elimination half-life increased by about 16% in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. Memantine should be administered with caution to patients with severe hepatic impairment as the pharmacokinetics of memantine have not been evaluated in that population.

                           <br/>  Coadministration of memantine with the AChE inhibitor donepezil hydrochloride did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either compound. Furthermore, memantine did not affect AChE inhibition by donepezil. In a 24-week controlled clinical study in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, the adverse event profile observed with a combination of memantine hydrochloride and donepezil was similar to that of donepezil alone.

                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>studies conducted with marker substrates of CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2, -2A6, -2C9, -2D6, -2E1, -3A4) showed minimal inhibition of these enzymes by memantine. In addition,
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>studies indicate that at concentrations exceeding those associated with efficacy, memantine does not induce the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP1A2, -2C9, -2E1 and -3A4/5. No pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes are expected. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of memantine for interaction with warfarin, and buproprion. Memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2B6 substrate buproprion or its metabolite hydroxy-buproprion. Furthermore, memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin as assessed by the prothrombin INR. 
  <br/>

                           <content styleCode="bold">Effect of Other Drugs on Memantine hydrochloride</content>
                           <br/>  Memantine is predominantly renally eliminated, and drugs that are substrates and/or inhibitors of the CYP450 system are not expected to alter the metabolism of memantine. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="bold">Drugs Eliminated via Renal Mechanisms</content>
                           <br/>  Because memantine is eliminated in part by tubular secretion, coadministration of drugs that use the same renal cationic system, including hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), triamterene (TA), metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, quinidine, and nicotine, could potentially result in altered plasma levels of both agents. However, coadministration of memantine hydrochloride and HCTZ/TA did not affect the bioavailability of either memantine or TA, and the bioavailability of HCTZ decreased by 20%. In addition, coadministration of memantine with the antihyperglycemic drug Glucovance
 
  <sup>®</sup>(glyburide and metformin hydrochloride) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of memantine, metformin and glyburide. Furthermore, memantine did not modify the serum glucose lowering effect of Glucovance
 
  <sup>®</sup>, indicating the absence of a pharmacodynamic interaction.

   <br/>
                           </content>Because the plasma protein binding of memantine is low (45%), an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to plasma proteins, such as warfarin and digoxin, is unlikely.

                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>The effectiveness of memantine hydrochloride as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease was demonstrated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2) conducted in the United States that assessed both cognitive function and day to day function. The mean age of patients participating in these two trials was 76 with a range of 50-93 years. Approximately 66% of patients were female and 91% of patients were Caucasian. A third study (Study 3), carried out in Latvia, enrolled patients with severe dementia, but did not assess cognitive function as a planned endpoint. Study Outcome Measures: In each U.S. study, the effectiveness of memantine hydrochloride was determined using both an instrument designed to evaluate overall function through caregiver-related assessment, and an instrument that measures cognition. Both studies showed that patients on memantine hydrochloride experienced significant improvement on both measures compared to placebo. 
  <br/>
                     <br/>  Day-to-day function was assessed in both studies using the modified Alzheimer’s disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living inventory (ADCS-ADL). The ADCS-ADL consists of a comprehensive battery of ADL questions used to measure the functional capabilities of patients. Each ADL item is rated from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss. The investigator performs the inventory by interviewing a caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient. A subset of 19 items, including ratings of the patient’s ability to eat, dress, bathe, telephone, travel, shop, and perform other household chores has been validated for the assessment of patients with moderate to severe dementia. This is the modified ADCS-ADL, which has a scoring range of 0 to 54, with the lower scores indicating greater functional impairment. 
  <br/>
                     <br/>  The ability of memantine hydrochloride to improve cognitive performance was assessed in both studies with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), a multi-item instrument that has been validated for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. The SIB examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of attention, orientation, language, memory, visuospatial ability, construction, praxis, and social interaction. The SIB scoring range is from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. 
  <br/>

                     <content styleCode="underline">Study 1 (Twenty-Eight-Week Study)</content>
                     <br/>  In a study of 28 weeks duration, 252 patients with moderate to severe probable Alzheimer’s disease (diagnosed by DSM-IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, with Mini-Mental State Examination scores ≥ 3 and ≤ 14 and Global Deterioration Scale Stages 5-6) were randomized to memantine hydrochloride or placebo. For patients randomized to memantine hydrochloride, treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily and increased weekly by 5 mg/day in divided doses to a dose of 20 mg/day (10 mg twice a day). 
  <br/>

                     <content styleCode="underline">Effects on the ADCS-ADL</content>
                     <br/>  Figure 1 shows the time course for the change from baseline in the ADCS-ADL score for patients in the two treatment groups completing the 28 weeks of the study. At 28 weeks of treatment, the mean difference in the ADCS-ADL change scores for the memantine hydrochloride -treated patients compared to the patients on placebo was 3.4 units. Using an analysis based on all patients and carrying their last study observation forward (LOCF analysis), memantine hydrochloride treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo.

At 24 weeks of treatment, the mean difference in the ADCS-ADL change scores for the memantine hydrochloride /donepezil treated patients (combination therapy) compared to the patients on placebo/donepezil (monotherapy) was 1.6 units. Using an LOCF analysis, memantine hydrochloride /donepezil treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo/donepezil.

  <br/>  In a double-blind study of 12 weeks duration, conducted in nursing homes in Latvia, 166 patients with dementia according to DSM-III-R, a Mini-Mental State Examination score of &lt; 10, and Global Deterioration Scale staging of 5 to 7 were randomized to either memantine hydrochloride or placebo. For patients randomized to memantine hydrochloride, treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily and increased to 10 mg once daily after 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the care dependency subscale of the Behavioral Rating Scale for Geriatric Patients (BGP), a measure of day-to-day function, and a Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), a measure of overall clinical effect. No valid measure of cognitive function was used in this study. A statistically significant treatment difference at 12 weeks that favored memantine hydrochloride over placebo was seen on both primary efficacy measures. Because the patients entered were a mixture of Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, an attempt was made to distinguish the two groups and all patients were later designated as having either vascular dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, based on their scores on the Hachinski Ischemic Scale at study entry. Only about 50% of the patients had computerized tomography of the brain. For the subset designated as having Alzheimer’s disease, a statistically significant treatment effect favoring memantine hydrochloride over placebo at 12 weeks was seen on both the BGP and CGI-C.
