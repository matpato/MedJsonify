                        <paragraph>Patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief following 2 weeks to 4 weeks of treatment with 330 mg once daily and who are able to tolerate pregabalin extended-release tablets, may be treated with up to 660 mg once daily. In view of the dose-dependent adverse reactions and the higher rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions, dosing above 330 mg/day should be reserved only for those patients who have on-going pain and are tolerating 330 mg daily. The maximum recommended dose of pregabalin extended-release tablets is 660 mg once daily.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID23">Use of pregabalin extended-release tablets are not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) less than 30 mL/min or who are undergoing hemodialysis. Those patients should receive pregabalin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In view of dose-dependent adverse reactions and because pregabalin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion, adjust the dose in patients with reduced renal function. Base the dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment on CLcr, as indicated in Table 2. To use the dosing tables, an estimate of the patient's CLcr in mL/min is needed. CLcr in mL/min may be estimated from serum creatinine (mg/dL) determination using the Cockcroft and Gault equation:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID25">Next, refer to the Dosage and Administration section to determine the recommended total daily dose based on indication, for a patient with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min). Then refer to Table 2 to determine the corresponding renal adjusted dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(For example: A patient initiating pregabalin extended-release tablets therapy for postherpetic neuralgia with normal renal function [CLcr greater than or equal to 60 mL/min], receives a single daily dose of 165 mg/day pregabalin. Therefore, a renal impaired patient with a CLcr of 50 mL/min would receive a single daily dose of 82.5 mg.)</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID45">Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including pregabalin, the active ingredient in pregabalin extended-release tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Monitor patients treated with any AED for any indication for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</paragraph>

In short-term trials of patients without clinically significant heart or peripheral vascular disease, there was no apparent association between peripheral edema and cardiovascular complications such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Peripheral edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials for pain indications, the incidence of peripheral edema for patients receiving pregabalin extended-release tablets in the single-blind phase was 5.3% of patients.

The majority of patients using thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents in the overall safety database were participants in studies of pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In this population, peripheral edema was reported in 3% (2/60) of patients who were using thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents only, 8% (69/859) of patients who were treated with pregabalin only and 19% (23/120) of patients who were on both pregabalin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents. Similarly, weight gain was reported in 0% (0/60) of patients on thiazolidinediones only; 4% (35/859) of patients on pregabalin only; and 7.5% (9/120) of patients on both drugs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs can cause weight gain and/or fluid retention, possibly exacerbating or leading to heart failure, monitor patients for the development of edema when co-administering pregabalin extended-release tablets and these agents.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in patients with postherpetic neuralgia and fibromyalgia in which a total of 1,242 patients received pregabalin extended-release tablets. Both studies were randomized withdrawal design where a 6 week single-blind, dose optimization phase was followed by a 13 week double-blind phase. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation from the single-blind phase of the study occurring in greater than or equal to 0.3% of patients were dizziness, somnolence, peripheral edema, fatigue, blurred vision and increased weight. Sixty-four percent of patients experienced adverse events during the single-blind phase, with the most common adverse events occurring in greater than or equal to 4% of patients being dizziness, somnolence, headache, fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, blurred vision, dry mouth and weight gain.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph ID="ID82">Since pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism in humans (less than 2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites) and does not bind to plasma proteins, its pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be affected by other agents through metabolic interactions or protein binding displacement. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies showed that pregabalin is unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID109">12</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>However, in animal reproduction studies, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities and other manifestations of developmental toxicity, including skeletal malformations, retarded ossification and decreased fetal body weight were observed in the offspring of rats and rabbits given pregabalin orally during organogenesis, at doses that produced plasma pregabalin exposures (AUC) greater than or equal to 18 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of 660 mg/day <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. In an animal development study, lethality, growth retardation and nervous and reproductive system functional impairment were observed in the offspring of rats given pregabalin during gestation and lactation. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity was approximately twice the human exposure at MRD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.

Fetal body weights were decreased at the highest dose. The low dose in this study was associated with a plasma exposure (AUC) approximately 18 times human exposure at the MRD of 660 mg/day. A no-effect dose for rat embryo-fetal developmental toxicity was not established.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When pregnant rabbits were given pregabalin (250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg or 1,250 mg/kg) orally throughout the period of organogenesis, decreased fetal body weight and increased incidences of skeletal malformations, visceral variations and retarded ossification were observed at the highest dose. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity in rabbits (500 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma exposure approximately 17 times human exposure at the MRD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study in which female rats were dosed with pregabalin (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, 1,250 mg/kg or 2,500 mg/kg) throughout gestation and lactation, offspring growth was reduced at greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg and offspring survival was decreased at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg. The effect on offspring survival was pronounced at doses greater than or equal to 1,250 mg/kg, with 100% mortality in high-dose litters. When offspring were tested as adults, neurobehavioral abnormalities (decreased auditory startle responding) were observed at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg and reproductive impairment (decreased fertility and litter size) was seen at 1,250 mg/kg. The no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats (50 mg/kg) produced a plasma exposure approximately 2 times human exposure at the MRD.</paragraph>

Pregabalin 150 mg oral capsule was given every 12 hours (300 mg daily dose) for a total of 4 doses. Pregabalin was detected in breast milk at average steady-state concentrations approximately 76% of those in maternal plasma. The estimated average daily infant dose of pregabalin from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) was 0.31 mg/kg/day, which on a mg/kg basis would be approximately 7% of the maternal dose. The study did not evaluate the effects of pregabalin on milk production. Infants did not receive breast milk obtained during the dosing period, therefore, the effects of pregabalin on the breastfed infant were not evaluated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority study to assess the effect of pregabalin on sperm characteristics, healthy male subjects received pregabalin at a daily dose up to 600 mg (n=111) or placebo (n=109) for 13 weeks (1 complete sperm cycle) followed by a 13 week washout period (off-drug). A total of 65 subjects in the pregabalin group (59%) and 62 subjects in the placebo group (57%) were included in the per protocol (PP) population. These subjects took study drug for at least 8 weeks, had appropriate timing of semen collections and did not have any significant protocol violations. Among these subjects, approximately 9% of the pregabalin group (6/65) vs. 3% in the placebo group (2/62) had greater than or equal to 50% reduction in mean sperm concentrations from baseline at Week 26 (the primary endpoint). The difference between pregabalin and placebo was within the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 20%. There were no adverse effects of pregabalin on sperm morphology, sperm motility, serum FSH or serum testosterone levels as compared to placebo. In subjects in the PP population with greater than or equal to 50% reduction in sperm concentration from baseline, sperm concentrations were no longer reduced by greater than or equal to 50% in any affected subject after an additional 3 months off-drug. In 1 subject, however, subsequent semen analyses demonstrated reductions from baseline of greater than or equal to 50% at 9 months and 12 months off-drug. The clinical relevance of these data is unknown.</paragraph>

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID111">Pregabalin binds with high affinity to the alpha<sub>2</sub>-delta site (an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels) in central nervous system tissues. Although the mechanism of action of pregabalin has not been fully elucidated, results with genetically modified mice and with compounds structurally related to pregabalin (such  as gabapentin) suggest that binding to the alpha<sub>2</sub>-delta subunit may be involved in pregabalin's anti-nociceptive and antiseizure effects in animals. In animal models of nerve damage, pregabalin  has been shown to reduce calcium-dependent release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters in the spinal cord, possibly by disrupting alpha<sub>2</sub>-delta containing-calcium channel trafficking  and/or reducing calcium currents. Evidence from other animal models of nerve damage and persistent pain suggest the anti-nociceptive activities of pregabalin may also be mediated through interactions with descending noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways originating from the brainstem that modulate pain transmission in the spinal cord.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While pregabalin is a structural derivative of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), it does not bind directly to GABA<sub>A</sub>, GABA<sub>B</sub> or benzodiazepine receptors, does not augment GABA<sub>A</sub> responses in cultured neurons, does not alter rat brain GABA concentration or have acute effects on GABA uptake or degradation. However, in cultured neurons prolonged application of pregabalin increases the density of GABA transporter protein and increases the rate of functional GABA transport. Pregabalin does not block sodium channels, is not active at opiate receptors and does not alter cyclooxygenase enzyme activity. It is inactive at serotonin and dopamine receptors and does not inhibit dopamine, serotonin or noradrenaline reuptake.</paragraph>

The rate and extent of pregabalin extended-release tablets absorption is similar when administered following a 400 calorie to 500 calorie, 30% fat or an 800 calorie to 1,000 calorie, 15%, 30% or 50% fat evening meal.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pregabalin does not bind to plasma proteins. The apparent volume of distribution of pregabalin following oral administration is approximately 0.5 L/kg. Pregabalin is a substrate for system L transporter which is responsible for the transport of large amino acids across the blood brain barrier. Although there are no data in humans, pregabalin has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier in mice, rats and monkeys. In addition, pregabalin has been shown to cross the placenta in rats and is present in the milk of lactating rats.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pregabalin undergoes negligible metabolism in humans. Following a dose of radiolabeled pregabalin, approximately 90% of the administered dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged pregabalin. The N-methylated derivative of pregabalin, the major metabolite of pregabalin found in urine, accounted for 0.9% of the dose. In preclinical studies, pregabalin (S-enantiomer) did not undergo racemization to the R-enantiomer in mice, rats, rabbits or monkeys.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pregabalin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by renal excretion as unchanged drug with a mean elimination half-life of 6.3 hours in subjects with normal renal function. Mean renal clearance was estimated to be 67 mL/min to 80.9 mL/min in young healthy subjects. Because pregabalin is not bound to plasma proteins this clearance rate indicates that renal tubular reabsorption is involved.

Plasma pregabalin exposure (AUC) in mice receiving the lowest dose that increased hemangiosarcomas was approximately equal to the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRD) of 660 mg/day. A no-effect dose for induction of hemangiosarcomas in mice was not established. No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in 2 studies in Wistar rats following dietary administration of pregabalin for 2 years at doses (50 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg or 450 mg/kg in males and 100 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg or 900 mg/kg in females) that were associated with plasma exposures in males and females up to approximately 15 times and 26 times, respectively, human exposure at the MRD.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In fertility studies in which male rats were orally administered pregabalin (50 mg/kg to 2,500 mg/kg) prior to and during mating with untreated females, a number of adverse reproductive and developmental effects were observed. These included decreased sperm counts and sperm motility, increased sperm abnormalities, reduced fertility, increased preimplantation embryo loss, decreased litter size, decreased fetal body weights and an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities. Effects on sperm and fertility parameters were reversible in studies of this duration (3 months to 4 months). The no-effect dose for male reproductive toxicity in these studies (100 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma pregabalin exposure (AUC) approximately 4 times human exposure at the MRD of 660 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In addition, adverse reactions on reproductive organ (testes, epididymides) histopathology were observed in male rats exposed to pregabalin (500 mg/kg to 1,250 mg/kg) in general toxicology studies of 4 weeks or greater duration. The no-effect dose for male reproductive organ histopathology in rats (250 mg/kg) was associated with a plasma exposure approximately 10 times human exposure at the MRD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a fertility study in which female rats were given pregabalin (500 mg/kg, 1,250 mg/kg or 2,500 mg/kg) orally prior to and during mating and early gestation, disrupted estrous cyclicity and an increased number of days to mating were seen at all doses and embryolethality occurred at the highest dose. The low dose in this study produced a plasma exposure approximately 10 times that in humans receiving the MRD. A no-effect dose for female reproductive toxicity in rats was not established.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID124">Support for efficacy of pregabalin extended-release tablets for the management of PHN and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was based on the efficacy of pregabalin for these indications along with an adequate and well-controlled study in adults with PHN. This 19 week randomized withdrawal study compared daily doses of pregabalin extended-release tablets 82.5 mg, 165 mg, 247.5 mg, 330 mg, 495 mg or 660 mg with placebo. Those enrolled were required to have pain present for more than 3 months after healing of the herpes zoster skin rash and a baseline pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on the numeric rating scale (NRS)-Pain (assessed over a 1 week recall period). The baseline mean pain scores were 6.83 for pregabalin extended-release tablets-treated patients vs. 6.85 for placebo-treated patients. A total of 82.4% of patients completed the single-blind phase of the study. Patients were considered responders if they had at least a 50% reduction in pain in the single-blind phase. Those who responded to treatment were then randomized in the double-blind phase to treatment with either the pregabalin extended-release tablets dose achieved in the single-blind phase or placebo. Patients were treated for up to 3 months following randomization. A total of 87.5% of pregabalin extended-release tablets-treated patients and 78% of placebo-treated patients completed the double-blind phase of the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pregabalin extended-release tablets treatment demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the endpoint change in mean pain score from baseline compared to placebo. For a range of levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 1 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement. In the pregabalin extended-release tablets group, 79.8% of subjects achieved at least a 30% improvement and 73.6% at least 50% improvement in pain intensity. In the placebo group, 64.9% of subjects achieved at least a 30% improvement and 54.6% at least a 50% improvement in pain intensity.</paragraph>
