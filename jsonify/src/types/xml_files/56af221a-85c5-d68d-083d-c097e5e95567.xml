                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Risedronate sodium tablets, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when risedronate sodium is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers) [<content styleCode="italics">see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#CONTRAINDICATIONS">4</linkHtml>), Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#_7AD02C21-81F7-6D22-8146-ED4E4BBCF11C">6.1</linkHtml>), Information for Patients (<linkHtml href="#_1F3EBD1F-1ADF-FE56-EE6C-019C1AA53A13">17.1</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue risedronate sodium tablets and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 ounces) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient [<content styleCode="italics">see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#DOSAGE_AND_ADMINISTRATION">2</linkHtml>)</content>]. In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with risedronate sodium tablets should be used under appropriate supervision. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph> Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including risedronate sodium tablets. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (for example, tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (for example, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (for example, periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures).  The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.<content styleCode="italics"> </content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are traverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (for example, prednisone) at the time of fracture.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg once daily in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational trials of 3232 women aged 38 to 85 years with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The duration of the trials was up to three years, with 1619 patients exposed to placebo and 1613 patients exposed to risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and H<sub>2</sub> antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All women received 1000 mg of elemental calcium plus vitamin D supplementation up to 500 international units per day if their 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> level was below normal at baseline. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The incidence of all-cause mortality was 2.0% in the placebo group and 1.7% in the  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily group.

The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 15.6% in the placebo group and 14.8% in the  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg group. The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than 10 percent of subjects were: back pain, arthralgia, abdominal pain and dyspepsia.

                        <paragraph>One study of about 500 early postmenopausal women has been conducted to date in which treatment with risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily plus estrogen replacement therapy was compared to estrogen replacement therapy alone.

If considered appropriate, risedronate sodium tablets may be used concomitantly with hormone replacement therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data on the use of risedronate sodium tablets in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Discontinue risedronate sodium tablets when pregnancy is recognized. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, daily oral administration of risedronate to pregnant rats during organogenesis decreased neonatal survival and body weight at doses approximately 5 and 26 times, respectively, the highest recommended human daily dose of 30 mg (based on body surface area, mg/m<sup>2</sup>). A low incidence of cleft palate was observed in fetuses of dams treated at doses approximately equal to the 30 mg human daily dose. Delayed skeletal ossification was observed in fetuses of dams treated at approximately 2.5 to 5 times the 30 mg human daily dose. Periparturient mortality due to maternal hypocalcemia occurred in dams and neonates upon daily oral administration of risedronate to pregnant rats during mating and/or gestation starting at doses equivalent to the 30 mg daily human dose. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from which they are gradually released over a period of years. The amount of bisphosphonate incorporated into adult bone and available for release into the systemic circulation is directly related to the dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Consequently, based on the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates, there is a potential risk of fetal harm, predominantly skeletal, if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on this risk has not been studied.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In animal studies, pregnant rats received risedronate sodium during organogenesis at doses equivalent to 1 to 26 times the 30 mg human daily dose (based on body surface area, mg/m<sup>2</sup>). Survival of neonates was decreased in dams treated during gestation with oral doses approximately 5 times the human dose, and body weight was decreased in neonates of dams treated with approximately 26 times the human dose. A low incidence of cleft palate was observed in fetuses of dams treated with oral doses approximately equal to the human dose. The number of fetuses exhibiting incomplete ossification of sternebrae or skull of dams treated with approximately 2.5 times the human dose was significantly increased compared to controls. Both incomplete ossification and unossified sternebrae were increased in fetuses of dams treated with oral doses approximately 5 times the human dose. No significant ossification effects were seen in fetuses of rabbits treated with oral doses approximately 7 times the human dose (the highest dose tested). However, 1 of 14 litters were aborted and 1 of 14 litters were delivered prematurely.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Periparturient mortality due to maternal hypocalcemia occurred in dams and neonates when pregnant rats were treated daily during mating and/or gestation with oral doses equivalent to the human dose or higher. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no data on the presence of risedronate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. A small degree of lacteal transfer occurred in nursing rats. The concentration of the drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk. However, when a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for risedronate sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from risedronate sodium or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Risedronate sodium tablets are not indicated for use in pediatric patients. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of risedronate was assessed in a one-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 143 pediatric patients (94 received risedronate) with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The enrolled population was predominantly patients with mild osteogenesis imperfecta (85% Type-I), aged 4 to less than 16 years, 50% male and 82% Caucasian, with a mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score of -2.08 (2.08 standard deviations below the mean for age-matched controls). Patients received either a 2.5 mg (less than or equal to 30 kg body weight) or 5 mg (greater than 30 kg body weight) daily oral dose. After one year, an increase in lumbar spine BMD in the risedronate group compared to the placebo group was observed. However, treatment with risedronate did not result in a reduction in the risk of fracture in pediatric patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. In risedronate sodium-treated subjects, no mineralization defects were noted in paired bone biopsy specimens obtained at baseline and month 12.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The overall safety profile of risedronate in OI patients treated for up to 12 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis. However, there was an increased incidence of vomiting compared to placebo. In this study, vomiting was observed in 15% of children treated with risedronate and 6% of patients treated with placebo. Other adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 10% of patients treated with risedronate and with a higher frequency than placebo were: pain in the extremity (21% with risedronate versus 16% with placebo), headache (20% versus 8%), back pain (17% versus 10%), pain (15% versus 10%), upper abdominal pain (11% versus 8%), and bone pain (10% versus 4%).</paragraph>

The corresponding proportions were 26% and 11% in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis trials, and 40% and 26% in Paget’s disease trials.  No overall differences in efficacy between geriatric and younger patients were observed in these studies. In the male osteoporosis trial, 28% of patients receiving risedronate sodium tablets were between 65 and 75 years of age and 9% were over 75. The lumbar spine BMD response for risedronate sodium tablets compared to placebo was 5.6% for subjects less than 65 years and 2.9% for subjects greater than or equal to 65 years. No overall differences in safety between geriatric and younger patients were observed in the risedronate sodium trials, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Risedronate sodium has an affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals in bone and acts as an antiresorptive agent. At the cellular level, risedronate sodium inhibits osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface, but show evidence of reduced active resorption (for example, lack of ruffled border). Histomorphometry in rats, dogs, and minipigs showed that risedronate sodium treatment reduces bone turnover (activation frequency, that is, the rate at which bone remodeling sites are activated) and bone resorption at remodeling sites.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Risedronate sodium treatment decreases the elevated rate of bone turnover that is typically seen in postmenopausal osteoporosis. In clinical trials, administration of risedronate sodium to postmenopausal women resulted in decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover, including urinary deoxypyridinoline/creatinine and urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (markers of bone resorption) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (a marker of bone formation). At the 5 mg dose, decreases in deoxypyridinoline/creatinine were evident within 14 days of treatment. Changes in bone formation markers were observed later than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of bone resorption and bone formation; decreases in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase of about 20% were evident within 3 months of treatment. Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of about 40% below baseline values by the sixth month of treatment and remained stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years. Bone turnover is decreased as early as 14 days and maximally within about 6 months of treatment, with achievement of a new steady-state that more nearly approximates the rate of bone turnover seen in premenopausal women. In a 1-year study comparing daily versus weekly oral dosing regimens of risedronate sodium for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women,  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily and  risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week decreased urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide by 60% and 61%, respectively. In addition, serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was also reduced by 42% and 41% in the  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily and  risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week groups, respectively. When postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were treated for 1 year with  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily or  risedronate sodium tablets 75 mg two consecutive days per month, urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide was decreased by 54% and 52%, respectively, and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was reduced by 36% and 35%, respectively. In a 1–year study comparing  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily versus  risedronate sodium tablets 150 mg once-a-month in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, urinary collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide was decreased by 52% and 49%, respectively, and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase was reduced by 31% and 32%, respectively.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Based on simultaneous modeling of serum and urine data, peak absorption after an oral dose is achieved at approximately 1 hour (T<sub>max</sub>) and occurs throughout the upper gastrointestinal tract. The fraction of the dose absorbed is independent of dose over the range studied (single dose, from 2.5 mg to 30 mg; multiple dose, from 2.5 mg to 5 mg). Steady-state conditions in the serum are observed within 57 days of daily dosing. Mean absolute oral bioavailability of the 30 mg tablet is 0.63% (90% CI: 0.54% to 0.75%) and is comparable to a solution.</paragraph>

                           <br/>The extent of absorption of a 30 mg dose (three 10 mg tablets) when administered 0.5 hours before breakfast is reduced by 55% compared to dosing in the fasting state (no food or drink for 10 hours prior to or 4 hours after dosing). Dosing 1 hour prior to breakfast reduces the extent of absorption by 30% compared to dosing in the fasting state. Dosing either 0.5 hours prior to breakfast or 2 hours after dinner (evening meal) results in a similar extent of absorption. Risedronate sodium tablets are effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. </paragraph>

                           <br/>The mean steady-state volume of distribution for risedronate is 13.8 L/kg in humans. Human plasma protein binding of drug is about 24%. Preclinical studies in rats and dogs dosed intravenously with single doses of [<sup>14</sup>C] risedronate indicate that approximately 60% of the dose is distributed to bone. The remainder of the dose is excreted in the urine. After multiple oral dosing in rats, the uptake of risedronate in soft tissues was in the range of 0.001% to 0.01%. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Excretion</content>
                           <br/>In young healthy subjects, approximately half of the absorbed dose of risedronate was excreted in urine within 24 hours, and 85% of an intravenous dose was recovered in the urine over 28 days. Based on simultaneous modeling of serum and urine data, mean renal clearance was 105 mL/min (CV = 34%) and mean total clearance was 122 mL/min (CV = 19%), with the difference primarily reflecting nonrenal clearance or clearance due to adsorption to bone. The renal clearance is not concentration dependent, and there is a linear relationship between renal clearance and creatinine clearance. Unabsorbed drug is eliminated unchanged in feces. In osteopenic postmenopausal women, the terminal exponential half-life was 561 hours, mean renal clearance was 52 mL/min (CV = 25%), and mean total clearance was 73 mL/min (CV = 15%). </paragraph>

                           <br/>In a 104-week carcinogenicity study, rats were administered daily oral doses up to approximately 8 times the maximum recommended human daily dose. There were no significant drug-induced tumor findings in male or female rats. The high dose male group was terminated early in the study (Week 93) due to excessive toxicity, and data from this group were not included in the statistical evaluation of the study results. In an 80-week carcinogenicity study, mice were administered daily oral doses approximately 6.5 times the human dose.

Risedronate was positive in a chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells at highly cytotoxic concentrations (greater than 675 mcg/mL, survival of 6% to 7%).

In male rats, testicular and epididymal atrophy and inflammation were noted at approximately 13 times the human dose. Testicular atrophy was also noted in male rats after 13 weeks of treatment at oral doses approximately 5 times the human dose. There was moderate-to-severe spermatid maturation block after 13 weeks in male dogs at an oral dose approximately 8 times the human dose.

                        <paragraph>Risedronate demonstrated potent anti-osteoclast, antiresorptive activity in ovariectomized rats and minipigs. Bone mass and biomechanical strength were increased dose-dependently at daily oral doses up to 4 and 25 times the human recommended oral dose of 5 mg for rats and minipigs, respectively. Risedronate treatment maintained the positive correlation between BMD and bone strength and did not have a negative effect on bone structure or mineralization. In intact dogs, risedronate induced positive bone balance at the level of the bone remodeling unit at oral doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 times the 5 mg/day human daily dose.<content styleCode="underline"/>

                        <paragraph>In dogs treated with an oral dose approximately 5 times the human daily dose, risedronate caused a delay in fracture healing of the radius. The observed delay in fracture healing is similar to other bisphosphonates. This effect did not occur at a dose approximately 0.5 times the human daily dose.

                        <paragraph>The Schenk rat assay, based on histologic examination of the epiphyses of growing rats after drug treatment, demonstrated that risedronate did not interfere with bone mineralization even at the highest dose tested, which was approximately 3500 times the lowest antiresorptive dose in this model (1.5 mcg/kg/day) and approximately 800 times the human daily dose of 5 mg. This indicates that risedronate sodium tablets administered at the therapeutic dose is unlikely to induce osteomalacia.

                        <paragraph>The fracture efficacy of  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was demonstrated in 2 large, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies that enrolled a total of almost 4000 postmenopausal women under similar protocols. The Multinational study (VERT MN) ( risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg, N = 408) was conducted primarily in Europe and Australia; a second study was conducted in North America (VERT NA) ( risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg, N = 821). Patients were selected on the basis of radiographic evidence of previous vertebral fracture, and therefore, had established disease. The average number of prevalent vertebral fractures per patient at study entry was 4 in VERT MN, and 2.5 in VERT NA, with a broad range of baseline BMD levels. All patients in these studies received supplemental calcium 1000 mg/day. Patients with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels (approximately 40 nmol/L or less) also received supplemental vitamin D 500 international units/day.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Fractures of previously undeformed vertebrae (new fractures) and worsening of pre-existing vertebral fractures were diagnosed radiographically; some of these fractures were also associated with symptoms (that is, clinical fractures). Spinal radiographs were scheduled annually and prospectively planned analyses were based on the time to a patient’s first diagnosed fracture. The primary endpoint for these studies was the incidence of new and worsening vertebral fractures across the period of 0 to 3 years.  Risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily significantly reduced the incidence of new and worsening vertebral fractures and of new vertebral fractures in both VERT NA and VERT MN at all time points (Table 3). The reduction in risk seen in the subgroup of patients who had 2 or more vertebral fractures at study entry was similar to that seen in the overall study population.</paragraph>

Fractures at these sites were collectively referred to as osteoporosis-related nonvertebral fractures. Risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily significantly reduced the incidence of nonvertebral osteoporosis-related fractures over 3 years in VERT NA (8% versus 5%; relative risk reduction 39%) and reduced the fracture incidence in VERT MN from 16% to 11%. There was a significant reduction from 11% to 7% when the studies were combined, with a corresponding 36% reduction in relative risk. Figure 1 shows the overall results as well as the results at the individual skeletal sites for the combined studies.</paragraph>

                           </content>The results of 4 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (VERT MN, VERT NA, BMD MN, BMD NA) demonstrate that risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily increases BMD at the spine, hip, and wrist compared to the effects seen with placebo. Table 4 displays the significant increases in BMD seen at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, femoral trochanter, and midshaft radius in these trials compared to placebo. In both VERT studies (VERT MN and VERT NA), risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily produced increases in lumbar spine BMD that were progressive over the 3 years of treatment and were statistically significant relative to baseline and to placebo at 6 months and at all later time points. </paragraph>

                           <br/>Bone biopsies from 110 postmenopausal women were obtained at endpoint. Patients had received placebo or daily  risedronate sodium tablets (2.5 mg or 5 mg) for 2 to 3 years. Histologic evaluation (N = 103) showed no osteomalacia, impaired bone mineralization, or other adverse effects on bone in risedronate sodium-treated women. These findings demonstrate that bone formed during risedronate sodium tablets administration is of normal quality. The histomorphometric parameter mineralizing surface, an index of bone turnover, was assessed based upon baseline and post-treatment biopsy samples from 21 treated with placebo and 23 patients treated with  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg. Mineralizing surface decreased moderately in risedronate sodium-treated patients (median percent change: placebo, -21%;  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg, -74%), consistent with the known effects of treatment on bone turnover.</paragraph>

Both risedronate sodium and placebo-treated groups lost height during the studies. Patients who received risedronate sodium tablets had a statistically significantly smaller loss of height than those who received placebo. In VERT MN, the median annual height change was -2.4 mm/yr in the placebo group compared to -1.3 mm/yr in the  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily group. In VERT NA, the median annual height change was -1.1 mm/yr in the placebo group compared to -0.7 mm/yr in the  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis were demonstrated in a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 383 postmenopausal women (age range 42 to 63 years) within three years of menopause (risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg, N = 129). All patients in this study received supplemental calcium 1000 mg/day. Increases in BMD were observed as early as 3 months following initiation of  risedronate sodium tablets treatment.  Risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily produced significant mean increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter compared to placebo at the end of the study (Figure 2).  Risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily was also effective in patients with lower baseline lumbar spine BMD (more than 1 SD below the premenopausal mean) and in those with normal baseline lumbar spine BMD. Bone mineral density at the distal radius decreased in both risedronate sodium and placebo-treated women following 1 year of treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of  risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week for the prevention postmenopausal osteoporosis were demonstrated in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 278 patients ( risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg, N = 136). All patients were supplemented with 1000 mg elemental calcium and 400 international units vitamin D per day. The primary efficacy measure was the percent change in lumbar spine BMD from baseline after 1 year of treatment using LOCF (last observation carried forward).  Risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week resulted in a statistically significant mean difference from placebo in lumbar spine BMD of +2.9% (least square mean for placebo -1.05%; risedronate +1.83%).  Risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week also showed a statistically significant mean difference from placebo in BMD at the total proximal femur of +1.5% (placebo -0.53%; risedronate +1.01%), femoral neck of +1.2% (placebo -1.00%; risedronate +0.22%), and trochanter of +1.8% (placebo -0.74%; risedronate +1.07%).</paragraph>

                           </content>Bone biopsies from 53 postmenopausal women were obtained at endpoint. Patients had received  risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg plus estrogen or estrogen-alone once daily for 1 year. Histologic evaluation (N = 47) demonstrated that the bone of patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets plus estrogen was of normal lamellar structure and normal mineralization. The histomorphometric parameter mineralizing surface, a measure of bone turnover, was assessed based upon baseline and post-treatment biopsy samples from 12 patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets plus estrogen and 12 treated with estrogen-alone. Mineralizing surface decreased in both treatment groups (median percent change: risedronate sodium tablets plus estrogen, -79%; estrogen-alone, -50%), consistent with the known effects of these agents on bone turnover.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effects of  risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week on BMD were examined in a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study in 285 men with osteoporosis (Risedronate Sodium Tablets, N = 192). The patients had a mean age of 61 years (range 36 to 84 years) and 95% were Caucasian. At baseline, mean lumbar spine T-score was -3.2 and mean femoral neck T-score was -2.4. All patients in the study had either, 1) a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the femoral neck and less than or equal to -1 at the lumbar spine, or 2) a BMD T-score less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck and less than or equal to -2.5 at the lumbar spine. All patients were supplemented with calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D 400 to 500 international units/day.  Risedronate sodium tablets 35 mg once-a-week produced significant mean increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, trochanter, and total hip compared to placebo after 2 years of treatment (treatment difference: lumbar spine, 4.5%; femoral neck, 1.1%; trochanter, 2.2%; total proximal femur, 1.5%).</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients who were taking greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent demonstrated that risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg daily was effective in the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women who were either initiating or continuing  glucocorticoid therapy. The efficacy of risedronate sodium tablets therapy for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis beyond one year has not been studied.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The prevention study enrolled 228 patients (risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg, N = 76) (18 to 85 years of age), each of whom had initiated glucocorticoid therapy (mean daily dose of prednisone 21 mg) within the previous 3 months (mean duration of use prior to study 1.8 months) for rheumatic, skin, and pulmonary diseases. The mean lumbar spine BMD was normal at baseline (average T-score - 0.7). All patients in this study received supplemental calcium 500 mg/day. By the third month of treatment, and continuing through the year-long treatment, the placebo group experienced losses in BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter, while BMD was maintained or increased in the risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg group. At each skeletal site there were statistically significant differences between the placebo group and the risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg group at all timepoints (Months 3, 6, 9, and 12). The treatment differences increased with continued treatment. Although BMD increased at the distal radius in the risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg group compared to the placebo group, the difference was not statistically significant. The differences between placebo and risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg after 1 year were 3.8% at the lumbar spine, 4.1% at the femoral neck, and 4.6% at the trochanter, as shown in Figure 3. The results at these skeletal sites were similar to the overall results when the subgroups of men and postmenopausal women, but not premenopausal women, were analyzed separately. Risedronate sodium was effective at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter regardless of age (less than 65 vs. greater than or equal to 65), gender, prior and concomitant glucocorticoid dose, or baseline BMD. Positive treatment effects were also observed in patients taking glucocorticoids for a broad range of rheumatologic disorders, the most common of which were rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The treatment study of similar design enrolled 290 patients (risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg, N = 100) (19 to 85 years of age) with continuing, long-term (greater than or equal to 6 months) use of glucocorticoids (mean duration of use prior to study 60 months; mean daily dose of prednisone 15 mg) for rheumatic, skin, and pulmonary diseases. The baseline mean lumbar spine BMD was low (1.63 SD below the young healthy population mean), with 28% of the patients more than 2.5 SD below the mean. All patients in this study received supplemental calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D 400 international units/day. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After 1 year of treatment, the BMD of the placebo group was within 1% of baseline levels at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter. Risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg increased BMD at the lumbar spine (2.9%), femoral neck (1.8%), and trochanter (2.4%). The differences between risedronate sodium tablets and placebo were 2.7% at the lumbar spine, 1.9% at the femoral neck, and 1.6% at the trochanter as shown in Figure 4. The differences were statistically significant for the lumbar spine and femoral neck, but not at the femoral trochanter. Risedronate sodium tablets were similarly effective on lumbar spine BMD regardless of age (less than 65 vs. greater than or equal to 65), gender, or pre-study glucocorticoid dose. Positive treatment effects were also observed in patients taking glucocorticoids for a broad range of rheumatologic disorders, the most common of which were rheumatoid arthritis, temporal arteritis, and polymyalgia rheumatica.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the prevention study of patients initiating glucocorticoids, the incidence of vertebral fractures at 1 year was reduced from 17% in the placebo group to 6% in the risedronate sodium tablets group. In the treatment study of patients continuing glucocorticoids, the incidence of vertebral fractures was reduced from 15% in the placebo group to 5% in the risedronate sodium tablets group (Figure 5). The statistically significant reduction in vertebral fracture incidence in the analysis of the combined studies corresponded to an absolute risk reduction of 11% and a relative risk reduction of 70%. All vertebral fractures were diagnosed radiographically; some of these fractures also were associated with symptoms (that is, clinical fractures).</paragraph>

Patients had received placebo or daily risedronate sodium tablets (2.5 mg or 5 mg) for 1 year. Histologic evaluation (N = 33) showed that bone formed during treatment with risedronate sodium tablets was of normal lamellar structure and normal mineralization, with no bone or marrow abnormalities observed. The histomorphometric parameter mineralizing surface, a measure of bone turnover, was assessed based upon baseline and post-treatment biopsy samples from 10 patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets 5 mg. Mineralizing surface decreased 24% (median percent change) in these patients. Only a small number of placebo-treated patients had both baseline and post-treatment biopsy samples, precluding a meaningful quantitative assessment. <content styleCode="bold"/>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of risedronate sodium tablets was demonstrated in 2 clinical studies involving 120 men and 65 women. In a double-blind, active-controlled study of patients with moderate-to-severe Paget’s disease (serum alkaline phosphatase levels of at least 2 times the upper limit of normal), patients were treated with risedronate sodium tablets 30 mg daily for 2 months or Didronel (etidronate disodium) 400 mg daily for 6 months. At Day 180, 77% (43/56) of risedronate sodium-treated patients achieved normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, compared to 10.5% (6/57) of patients treated with Didronel (p less than 0.001). At Day 540, 16 months after discontinuation of therapy, 53% (17/32) of risedronate sodium-treated patients and 14% (4/29) of Didronel-treated patients with available data remained in biochemical remission. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the first 180 days of the active-controlled study, 85% (51/60) of risedronate sodium -treated patients demonstrated a greater than or equal to 75% reduction from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase excess (difference between measured level and midpoint of the normal range) with 2 months of treatment compared to 20% (12/60) in the Didronel-treated group with 6 months of treatment (p less than 0.001). Changes in serum alkaline phosphatase excess over time (shown in Figure 6) were significant following only 30 days of treatment, with a 36% reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase excess at that time compared to only a 6% reduction seen with Didronel treatment at the same time point (p less than 0.01).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Response to risedronate sodium therapy was similar between patients who had previously received anti-pagetic therapy and those who had not. In the active-controlled study, 4 patients previously non-responsive to 1 or more courses of anti-pagetic therapy (calcitonin, Didronel) responded to treatment with risedronate sodium tablets 30 mg daily (defined by at least a 30% change from baseline). Each of these patients achieved at least 90% reduction from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase excess, with 3 patients achieving normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase levels.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Histomorphometry of the bone was studied in 14 patients with bone biopsies: 9 patients had biopsies from pagetic bone lesions and 5 patients from non-pagetic bone. Bone biopsy results in non-pagetic bone did not reveal osteomalacia, impairment of bone remodeling, or induction of a significant decline in bone turnover in patients treated with risedronate sodium tablets.<content styleCode="bold"/>
