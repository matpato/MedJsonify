                              <paragraph>After the first dose of fingolimod capsules, the heart rate decrease starts within an hour. On Day 1, the maximum decline in heart rate generally occurs within 6 hours and recovers, although not to baseline levels, by 8 to 10 hours postdose. Because of physiological diurnal variation, there is a second period of heart rate decrease within 24 hours after the first dose. In some patients, heart rate decrease during the second period is more pronounced than the decrease observed in the first 6 hours. Heart rates below 40 bpm in adults, and below 50 bpm in pediatric patients occurred rarely. In controlled clinical trials in adult patients, adverse reactions of symptomatic bradycardia following the first dose were reported in 0.6% of patients receiving fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg and in 0.1% of patients on placebo. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic, but some patients experienced hypotension, dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, and/or chest pain that usually resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients with some preexisting conditions (e.g., ischemic heart disease, history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, history of symptomatic bradycardia, history of recurrent syncope, severe untreated sleep apnea, AV block, sinoatrial heart block) may poorly tolerate the fingolimod capsules-induced bradycardia, or experience serious rhythm disturbances after the first dose of fingolimod capsules. Prior to treatment with fingolimod capsules, these patients should have a cardiac evaluation by a physician appropriately trained to conduct such evaluation, and if treated with fingolimod capsules, should be monitored overnight with continuous ECG in a medical facility after the first dose.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Since initiation of fingolimod capsules treatment, results in decreased heart rate and may prolong the QT interval, patients with a prolonged QTc interval (&gt; 450 msec adult and pediatric males, &gt; 470 msec adult females, or &gt; 460 msec pediatric females) before dosing or during 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, congenital long-QT syndrome), or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes (e.g., citalopram, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, methadone, erythromycin) should be monitored overnight with continuous ECG in a medical facility.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Following the second dose, a further decrease in heart rate may occur when compared to the heart rate prior to the second dose, but this change is of a smaller magnitude than that observed following the first dose. With continued dosing, the heart rate returns to baseline within 1 month of chronic treatment. Clinical data indicate effects of fingolimod capsules on heart rate are maximal after the first dose although milder effects on heart rate may persist for, on average, 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy at which time heart rate generally returns to baseline. Physicians should continue to be alert to patient reports of cardiac symptoms.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Initiation of fingolimod capsules treatment has resulted in transient AV conduction delays. In controlled clinical trials in adult patients, first-degree AV block after the first dose occurred in 4.7% of patients receiving fingolimod capsules and 1.6% of patients on placebo. In a study of 697 patients with available 24-hour Holter monitoring data after their first dose (N = 351 receiving fingolimod capsules and N = 346 on placebo), second-degree AV blocks (Mobitz Types I [Wenckebach] or 2:1 AV blocks) occurred in 4% (N = 14) of patients receiving fingolimod capsules and 2% (N = 7) of patients on placebo. Of the 14 patients receiving fingolimod capsules, 7 patients had 2:1 AV block (5 patients within the first 6 hours postdose and 2 patients after 6 hours postdose). All second-degree AV blocks on placebo were Mobitz Type I and occurred after the first 12 hours postdose. The conduction abnormalities were usually transient and asymptomatic, and resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment, but they occasionally required treatment with atropine or isoproterenol.</paragraph>

Isolated delayed onset events, including transient asystole and unexplained death, have occurred within 24 hours of the first dose. These events were confounded by concomitant medications and/or preexisting disease, and the relationship to fingolimod capsules is uncertain. Cases of syncope were also reported after the first dose of fingolimod capsules.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Fingolimod capsules cause a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20%-30% of baseline values because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. Fingolimod capsules may therefore increase the risk of infections, some serious in nature <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_3a34c607-11ad-4527-9bba-963adc786298">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. Life-threatening and fatal infections have occurred in association with fingolimod capsules.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Before initiating treatment with fingolimod capsules, a recent CBC (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Consider suspending treatment with fingolimod capsules if a patient develops a serious infection, and reassess the benefits and risks prior to reinitiation of therapy. Because the elimination of fingolimod after discontinuation may take up to 2 months, continue monitoring for infections throughout this period. Instruct patients receiving fingolimod capsules to report symptoms of infections to a physician. Patients with active acute or chronic infections should not start treatment until the infection(s) is resolved.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In MS placebo-controlled trials in adult patients, the overall rate of infections (72%) with fingolimod capsules was similar to placebo. However, bronchitis, herpes zoster, influenza, sinusitis, and pneumonia were more common in fingolimod capsules-treated patients. Serious infections occurred at a rate of 2.3% in the fingolimod capsules group versus 1.6% in the placebo group.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the postmarketing setting, serious infections with opportunistic pathogens, including viruses (e.g., John Cunningham virus [JCV], herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus), fungi (e.g., cryptococci), and bacteria (e.g., atypical mycobacteria) have been reported with fingolimod capsules. Patients with symptoms and signs consistent with any of these infections should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Two patients died of herpetic infections during controlled trials. One death was due to disseminated primary herpes zoster and the other was to herpes simplex encephalitis. In both cases, the patients were taking a 1.25 mg dose of fingolimod (higher than the recommended 0.5 mg dose) and had received high-dose corticosteroid therapy to treat suspected MS relapses.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Serious, life-threatening events of disseminated varicella zoster and herpes simplex infections, including cases of encephalitis and multiorgan failure, have occurred with fingolimod capsules in the postmarketing setting. Include disseminated herpetic infections in the differential diagnosis of patients who are receiving fingolimod capsules and present with an atypical MS relapse or multiorgan failure.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Cases of Kaposiâs sarcoma have been reported in the postmarketing setting.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="xmChange">Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients with MS who received fingolimod capsules in the postmarketing setting. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. PML has occurred in patients who had not been treated previously with natalizumab, which has a known association with PML, were not taking any other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications concomitantly, and did not have any ongoing systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function. Longer treatment duration increases the risk of PML in fingolimod capsules-treated patients, the majority of cases have occurred in patients treated with fingolimod capsules for at least 18 months</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold fingolimod capsules and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Cases of PML, diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML, have been reported in patients treated with MS medications associated with PML, including fingolimod capsules. Many of these patients subsequently became symptomatic with PML. Therefore, monitoring with MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be useful, and any suspicious findings should lead to further investigation to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported following discontinuation of another MS medication associated with PML in patients with PML who were initially asymptomatic compared to patients with PML who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis. It is not known whether these differences are due to early detection and discontinuation of MS treatment or due to differences in disease in these patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If PML is confirmed, treatment with fingolimod capsules should be discontinued. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators, including fingolimod capsules, who developed PML and subsequently discontinued treatment. IRIS presents as a clinical decline in the patientâs condition that may be rapid, can lead to serious neurological complications or death, and is often associated with characteristic changes on MRI. The time to onset of IRIS in patients with PML was generally within a few months after S1P receptor modulator discontinuation. Monitoring for development of IRIS and appropriate treatment of the associated inflammation should be undertaken.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.5 Liver Injury </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinically significant liver injury has occurred in patients treated with fingolimod capsules in the postmarketing setting. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes and elevated total bilirubin, have occurred as early as ten days after the first dose and have also been reported after prolonged use. Cases of acute liver failure requiring liver transplant have been reported.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 2-year placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients, elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGT) to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater occurred in 14% of patients treated with fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg and 3% of patients on placebo. Elevations 5-fold the ULN or greater occurred in 4.5% of patients on fingolimod capsules and 1% of patients on placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 to 9 months. In clinical trials, fingolimod capsules were discontinued if the elevation exceeded 5 times the ULN. Serum transaminase levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of fingolimod capsules. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations occurred with rechallenge in some patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prior to starting treatment with fingolimod capsules (within 6 months), obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Obtain transaminase levels and total bilirubin levels periodically until two months after fingolimod capsules discontinuation. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury. Measure liver transaminase and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range, treatment with fingolimod capsules treatment should be interrupted. Treatment should not be resumed if a plausible alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established, because these patients are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because fingolimod capsules exposure is doubled in patients with severe hepatic impairment, these patients should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_ffcc2dd2-8e2a-4c91-b5b4-5d8a83d862d6">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_ee788e35-b09d-49e6-acbe-095efe880a46">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There have been rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reported in adult patients receiving fingolimod capsules. Symptoms reported included sudden onset of severe headache, altered mental status, visual disturbances, and seizure. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, fingolimod capsules should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Dose-dependent reductions in forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV1) and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were observed in patients treated with fingolimod capsules as early as 1 month after treatment initiation. In 2-year placebo-controlled trials in adult patients, the reduction from baseline in the percent of predicted values for FEV1 at the time of last assessment on drug was 2.8% for fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg and 1.0% for placebo. For DLCO, the reduction from baseline in percent of predicted values at the time of last assessment on drug was 3.3% for fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg and 0.5% for placebo. The changes in FEV1 appear to be reversible after treatment discontinuation. There is insufficient information to determine the reversibility of the decrease of DLCO after drug discontinuation. In MS placebo-controlled trials in adult patients, dyspnea was reported in 9% of patients receiving fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg and 7% of patients receiving placebo. Several patients discontinued fingolimod capsules because of unexplained dyspnea during the extension (uncontrolled) studies. Fingolimod capsules have not been tested in MS patients with compromised respiratory function.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function and evaluation of DLCO should be performed during therapy with fingolimod capsules if clinically indicated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on findings from animal studies, fingolimod capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, developmental toxicity was observed with administration of fingolimod at doses less than the recommended human dose.

                        <paragraph>MS relapses with tumefactive demyelinating lesions on imaging have been observed during fingolimod capsules therapy and after fingolimod capsules discontinuation in the postmarketing setting. Most reported cases of tumefactive MS in patients receiving fingolimod capsules have occurred within the first 9 months after fingolimod capsules initiation, but tumefactive MS may occur at any point during treatment. Cases of tumefactive MS have also been reported within the first 4 months after fingolimod capsules discontinuation. Tumefactive MS should be considered when a severe MS relapse occurs during fingolimod capsules treatment, especially during initiation, or after discontinuation of fingolimod capsules, prompting imaging evaluation and initiation of appropriate treatment.</paragraph>

This included 783 patients who received fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg in the 2-year placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 3) and 429 patients who received fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg in the 1-year active-controlled trial (Study 2). The overall exposure in the controlled trials was equivalent to 1716 person-years. Approximately 1000 patients received at least 2 years of treatment with fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg. In all clinical studies, including uncontrolled extension studies, the exposure to fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg was approximately 4119 person-years.</paragraph>

Adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred in more than 1% of patients taking fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg, were serum transaminase elevations (4.7% compared to 1% on placebo) and basal cell carcinoma (1% compared to 0.5% on placebo).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Fingolimod capsules reduce the immune response to vaccination. Vaccination may be less effective during and for up to 2 months after discontinuation of treatment with fingolimod capsules <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_3a34c607-11ad-4527-9bba-963adc786298">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during and for 2 months after treatment with fingolimod capsules because of the risk of infection. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating fingolimod capsules therapy.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Experience with fingolimod capsules in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow the heart rate or AV conduction (e.g., beta blockers, digoxin, or heart rate-slowing calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem or verapamil) is limited. Because initiation of fingolimod capsules treatment may result in an additional decrease in heart rate, concomitant use of these drugs during fingolimod capsules initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia or heart block. Seek advice from the physician prescribing these drugs regarding the possibility to switch to drugs that do not slow the heart rate or atrioventricular conduction before initiating fingolimod capsules. Patients who cannot switch should have overnight continuous ECG monitoring after the first dose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_82835896-9669-4e77-ab71-e3ecf90e06d0">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_3ce0c09f-ec25-47ac-bb03-cfb0d151b3df">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

Data from prospective reports to the fingolimod pregnancy registry are currently not sufficient to allow for an adequate assessment of the drug-associated risk for birth defects and miscarriage in humans. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In oral studies conducted in rats and rabbits, fingolimod demonstrated developmental toxicity, including an increase in malformations (rats) and embryolethality, when given to pregnant animals. In rats, the highest no-effect dose was less than the recommended human dose of 0.5 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis. The most common fetal visceral malformations in rats were persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect. The receptor affected by fingolimod (sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor) is known to be involved in vascular formation during embryogenesis <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#ID_6a945e7c-1302-46a7-acc1-5bb3ff45bbac">Data</linkHtml>)</content>.

Delayed sexual maturation was noted in females at the highest dose tested and in males at all doses. The bone changes observed in fingolimod-treated juvenile rats are consistent with a reported role of S1P in the regulation of bone mineral homeostasis.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Fingolimod is metabolized by sphingosine kinase to the active metabolite, fingolimod-phosphate. Fingolimod-phosphate is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, and binds with high affinity to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1, 3, 4, and 5. Fingolimod-phosphate blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The mechanism by which fingolimod exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown, but may involve reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In a thorough QT interval study of doses of 1.25 or 2.5 mg fingolimod at steady-state, when a negative chronotropic effect of fingolimod was still present, fingolimod treatment resulted in a prolongation of QTc, with the upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of 14.0 msec. There is no consistent signal of increased incidence of QTc outliers, either absolute or change from baseline, associated with fingolimod treatment. In MS studies, there was no clinically relevant prolongation of the QT interval, but patients at risk for QT prolongation were not included in clinical studies.</paragraph>

With continued daily dosing, the lymphocyte count continued to decrease over a 2-week period, reaching a nadir count of approximately 500 cells/mcL or approximately 30% of baseline. In a placebo-controlled study in 1272 MS patients (of whom 425 received fingolimod 0.5 mg daily and 418 received placebo), 18% (N = 78) of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg reached a nadir of &lt; 200 cells/mcL on at least 1 occasion. No patient on placebo reached a nadir of &lt; 200 cells/mcL. Low lymphocyte counts are maintained with chronic daily dosing of fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg daily.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>In the first study, the immunogenicity of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) immunization were assessed by IgM and IgG titers in a steady-state, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy adult volunteers. Compared to placebo, antigen-specific IgM titers were decreased by 91% and 25% in response to KLH and PPV-23, respectively, in subjects on fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg. Similarly, IgG titers were decreased by 45% and 50%, in response to KLH and PPV-23, respectively, in subjects on fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg daily compared to placebo. The responder rate for fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg as measured by the number of subjects with a &gt; 4-fold increase in KLH IgG was comparable to placebo and 25% lower for PPV-23 IgG, while the number of subjects with a &gt; 4-fold increase in KLH and PPV-23 IgM was 75% and 40% lower, respectively, compared to placebo. The capacity to mount a skin delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to <content styleCode="italics">Candida</content> and tetanus toxoid was decreased by approximately 30% in subjects on fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg daily, compared to placebo. Immunologic responses were further decreased with fingolimod 1.25 mg (a dose higher than recommended in MS) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_d760989b-406d-4a2c-b74e-ebd7a3fc89ef">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

The responder rate 3 weeks after vaccination, defined as seroconversion or a â¥ 4-fold increase in antibody directed against at least 1 of the 3 influenza strains, was 54% for fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg and 85% in the placebo group. The responder rate 3 weeks after vaccination, defined as seroconversion or a â¥ 4-fold increase in antibody directed against tetanus toxoid was 40% for fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg and 61% in the placebo group.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The biotransformation of fingolimod in humans occurs by 3 main pathways: by reversible stereoselective phosphorylation to the pharmacologically active (S)-enantiomer of fingolimod-phosphate, by oxidative biotransformation catalyzed mainly by the cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) and possibly other CYP4F isoenzymes with subsequent fatty acid-like degradation to inactive metabolites, and by formation of pharmacologically inactive non-polar ceramide analogs of fingolimod.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Inhibitors or inducers of CYP4F2 and possibly other CYP4F isozymes might alter the exposure of fingolimod or fingolimod-phosphate. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies in hepatocytes indicated that CYP3A4 may contribute to fingolimod metabolism in the case of strong induction of CYP3A4.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Fingolimod was examined for its potential to induce human CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP4F2, and MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) mRNA and CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP4F2 activity in primary human hepatocytes. Fingolimod did not induce mRNA or activity of the different CYP enzymes and MDR1 with respect to the vehicle control; therefore, no clinically relevant induction of the tested CYP enzymes or MDR1 by fingolimod are expected at therapeutic concentrations. Fingolimod-phosphate was also examined for its potential to induce mRNA and/or activity of human CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F12.

                                    <paragraph>Based on <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> data, fingolimod as well as fingolimod-phosphate are not expected to inhibit the uptake of comedications and/or biologics transported by the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). Similarly, they are not expected to inhibit the efflux of comedications and/or biologics transported by the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), the bile salt export pump (BSEP), the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at therapeutic concentrations.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>The coadministration of fingolimod 0.5 mg daily with oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) did not elicit any clinically significant change in oral contraceptives exposure. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate exposure were consistent with those from previous studies. No interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing other progestagens; however, an effect of fingolimod on their exposure is not expected.</paragraph>

These data indicate that fingolimod capsules are unlikely to reduce or increase the clearance of drugs cleared mainly by CYP3A4. Potent inhibition of transporters MDR1 (P-gp), MRP2, and OATP-1B1 does not influence fingolimod disposition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oral carcinogenicity studies of fingolimod were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, fingolimod was administered at oral doses of 0, 0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day for up to 2 years. The incidence of malignant lymphoma was increased in males and females at the mid and high dose. The lowest dose tested (0.025 mg/kg/day) is less than the RHD of 0.5 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis. In rats, fingolimod was administered at oral doses of 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.5, and 2.5 mg/kg/day. No increase in tumors was observed. The highest dose tested (2.5 mg/kg/day) is approximately 50 times the RHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lung toxicity was observed in 2 different strains of rats and in dogs and monkeys. The primary findings included increase in lung weight, associated with smooth muscle hypertrophy, hyperdistention of the alveoli, and/or increased collagen. Insufficient or lack of pulmonary collapse at necropsy, generally correlated with microscopic changes, was observed in all species. In rats and monkeys, lung toxicity was observed at all oral doses tested in chronic studies. The lowest doses tested in rats (0.05 mg/kg/day in the 2-year carcinogenicity study) and monkeys (0.5 mg/kg/day in the 39-week toxicity study) are similar to and approximately 20 times the RHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the 52-week oral study in monkeys, respiratory distress associated with ketamine administration was observed at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day; the most affected animal became hypoxic and required oxygenation. As ketamine is not generally associated with respiratory depression, this effect was attributed to fingolimod. In a subsequent study in rats, ketamine was shown to potentiate the bronchoconstrictive effects of fingolimod. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of fingolimod capsules was demonstrated in 2 studies that evaluated once-daily doses of fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Both studies included patients who had experienced at least 2 clinical relapses during the 2 years prior to randomization or at least 1 clinical relapse during the 1 year prior to randomization, and had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.5. Study 1 was a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with RRMS who had not received any interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate for at least the previous 3 months and had not received any natalizumab for at least the previous 6 months. Neurological evaluations were performed at screening, every 3 months and at time of suspected relapse. MRI evaluations were performed at screening, Month 6, Month 12, and Month 24. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Median age was 37 years, median disease duration was 6.7 years and median EDSS score at baseline was 2.0. Patients were randomized to receive fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg (N = 425), 1.25 mg (N = 429), or placebo (N = 418) for up to 24 months. Median time on study drug was 717 days on 0.5 mg, 715 days on 1.25 mg, and 719 days on placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The annualized relapse rate was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod capsules than in patients who received placebo. The secondary endpoint was the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression as measured by at least a 1-point increase from baseline in EDSS (0.5-point increase for patients with baseline EDSS of 5.5) sustained for 3 months. Time to onset of 3-month confirmed disability progression was significantly delayed with fingolimod capsules treatment compared to placebo. The 1.25 mg dose resulted in no additional benefit over the fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg dose. The results for this study are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Study 2 was a 1-year randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study in patients with RRMS who had not received any natalizumab in the previous 6 months. Prior therapy with interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate up to the time of randomization was permitted.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Neurological evaluations were performed at screening, every 3 months, and at the time of suspected relapses. MRI evaluations were performed at screening and at Month 12. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Median age was 36 years, median disease duration was 5.9 years, and median EDSS score at baseline was 2.0. Patients were randomized to receive fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg (N = 431), 1.25 mg (N = 426), or interferon beta-1a, 30 mcg via the intramuscular route (IM) once-weekly (N = 435) for up to 12 months. Median time on study drug was 365 days on fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg, 354 days on 1.25 mg, and 361 days on interferon beta-1a IM.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The annualized relapse rate was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg than in patients who received interferon beta-1a IM. The key secondary endpoints were number of new and newly enlarging T2 lesions and time to onset of 3-month confirmed disability progression as measured by at least a 1-point increase from baseline in EDSS (0.5-point increase for those with baseline EDSS of 5.5) sustained for 3 months. The number of new and newly enlarging T2 lesions was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod capsules than in patients who received interferon beta-1a IM. There was no significant difference in the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression between fingolimod capsules and interferon beta-1a-treated patients at 1 year. The 1.25 mg dose resulted in no additional benefit over the fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg dose. The results for this study are shown in Table 3.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.2 Pediatric Patients (10 to less than 18 Years of Age)  </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Study 4 (NCT 01892722) evaluated the efficacy of once-daily oral doses of fingolimod capsules 0.5 mg in pediatric patients 10 to less than 18 years of age with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Study 4 was a 215-patient, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial that compared fingolimod capsules to intramuscular interferon beta-1a. Prior therapy with interferon-beta, dimethyl fumarate, or glatiramer acetate up to the time of randomization was permitted. The study included patients who had experienced at least 1 clinical relapse during the year prior or 2 relapses during the 2 years prior to screening, or evidence of 1 or more Gd-enhancing lesions on MRI within 6 months prior to randomization, and had an EDSS score from 0 to 5.5. Neurological evaluations were scheduled at screening, every 3 months, and at the time of suspected relapses. MRI evaluations were performed at screening and every 6 months throughout the study. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At baseline, the median age was 16 years, median disease duration since first symptom was 1.5 years, and median EDSS score was 1.5. One patient received no study drug and is excluded from the analysis of efficacy. Median duration of exposure to study drug was 634 days in the fingolimod capsules group (n = 107) and 547 days in the interferon beta-1a group (n = 107). In the fingolimod capsules group, 6.5% of patients did not complete the study, compared to 18.5% in the interferon beta-1a group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint, the annualized relapse rate (ARR), was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod capsules (0.122) than in patients who received interferon beta-1a (0.675). Relative reduction in ARR was 81.9%. The annualized rate of the number of new or newly enlarged T2 lesions up to Month 24 (key secondary endpoint) was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod capsules, as was the number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per scan up to Month 24.</paragraph>
