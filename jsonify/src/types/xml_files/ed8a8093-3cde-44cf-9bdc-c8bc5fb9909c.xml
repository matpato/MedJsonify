                     <content styleCode="bold">Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with the use of montelukast sodium. The types of events reported were highly variable, and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggression, depression, sleep disturbances, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide). The mechanisms underlying NP events associated with montelukast sodium use are currently not well understood <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2ffedb63-c327-426e-80b7-82b773454052">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. </content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with use of montelukast sodium. These postmarketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without a previous history of psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported after montelukast sodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_416996d4-2238-466b-bc6a-b321356b03b4">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>; however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NP events are currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify risk factors for or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_bb89071b-9fed-4f0c-be08-4ace682436ee">Indications and Usage (1.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. In many cases, symptoms resolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore, continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur<content styleCode="italics">.</content>

                        <paragraph>Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Montelukast sodium chewable tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Each 4 mg and 5 mg chewable tablet contains 0.674 mg and 0.842 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. Before prescribing montelukast sodium chewable tablets to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including montelukast sodium chewable tablets.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 476 pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age. Cumulatively, 289 pediatric patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, and 241 for one year or longer in clinical trials. The safety profile of montelukast sodium in the 8-week, double-blind, pediatric efficacy trial was generally similar to the adult safety profile. In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age receiving montelukast sodium, the following reactions occurred with a frequency â¥2% and more frequently than in pediatric patients who received placebo: pharyngitis, influenza, fever, sinusitis, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, otitis, viral infection and laryngitis. The frequency of less common adverse reactions was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. With prolonged treatment, the adverse reactions profile did not significantly change.Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 56-week, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled parallel group study was conducted to assess the effect of montelukast sodium on growth rate in 360 patients with mild asthma, aged 6 to 8 years. Treatment groups included montelukast sodium 5 mg once daily, placebo, and beclomethasone dipropionate administered as 168 mcg twice daily with a spacer device. For each subject, a growth rate was defined as the slope of a linear regression line fit to the height measurements over 56 weeks. The primary comparison was the difference in growth rates between montelukast sodium and placebo groups. Growth rates, expressed as least-squares (LS) mean (95% CI) in cm/year, for the montelukast sodium, placebo, and beclomethasone treatment groups were 5.67 (5.46, 5.88), 5.64 (5.42, 5.86) and 4.86 (4.64, 5.08), respectively. The differences in growth rates, expressed as least-squares (LS) mean (95% CI) in cm/year, for montelukast sodium minus placebo, beclomethasone minus placebo, and montelukast sodium minus beclomethasone treatment groups were 0.03 (-0.26, 0.31), -0.78 (-1.06, -0.49); and 0.81 (0.53, 1.09), respectively. Growth rate (expressed as mean change in height over time) for each treatment group is shown in FIGURE 1.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10 mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required.</paragraph>

                     <title>12.1 	Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC<sub>4</sub>, LTD<sub>4</sub>, LTE<sub>4</sub>) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT<sub>1</sub>) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT<sub>1</sub> receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or Î²-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD<sub>4</sub> at the CysLT<sub>1</sub> receptor without any agonist activity.</paragraph>

                     <title>12.2 	Pharmacodynamics</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD<sub>4</sub> in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD<sub>4</sub>-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known <content styleCode="italics">[see </content>

                        <paragraph>Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady-state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters.Â Orally administered montelukast distributes into the brainÂ in rats.Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and &lt;0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10 mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%).Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled Î²-agonist per day on an âas-neededâ basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 66% (approximate range, 40% to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV<sub>1</sub> and daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects.</paragraph>

Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast sodium 10 mg tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> percent change from baseline (13.0%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p&lt;0.001); the change from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.10 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p&lt;0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters).

In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p &lt; 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p &lt; 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, âas-neededâ Î²-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma.Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of montelukast sodium in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age was demonstrated in one 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 336 patients (201 treated with montelukast sodium and 135 treated with placebo) using an inhaled Î²-agonist on an âas-neededâ basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>Â of 72% (approximate range, 45% to 90%) and a mean daily inhaled Î²-agonist requirement of 3.4 puffs of albuterol. Approximately 36% of the patients were on inhaled corticosteroids. The median age was 11 years (range 6 to 15); 35.4% were females and 64.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 80.1% Caucasian, 12.8% Black, 4.5% Hispanic and 2.7% other origins.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Compared with placebo, treatment with one 5 mg montelukast sodium chewable tablet daily resulted in a significant improvement in mean morning FEV<sub>1</sub>Â percent change from baseline (8.7% in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2% change from baseline in the placebo group, p&lt;0.001). There was a significant decrease in the mean percentage change in daily âas-neededâ inhaled Î²-agonist use (11.7% decrease from baseline in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 8.2% increase from baseline in the placebo group, p&lt;0.05). This effect represents a mean decrease from baseline of 0.56 and 0.23 puffs per day for the montelukast and placebo groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses indicated that younger pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 had efficacy results comparable to those of the older pediatric patients aged 12 to 14.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Similar to the adult studies, no significant change in the treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily administration in one open-label extension trial without a concurrent placebo group for up to 6 months.Â </paragraph>

The median age was 4 years (range 2 to 6); 41.5% were females and 58.5% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 56.5% Caucasian, 20.9% Hispanic, 14.4% other origins and 8.3% Black.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While the primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of montelukast sodium in this age group, the study included exploratory efficacy evaluations, including daytime and overnight asthma symptom scores, Î²-agonist use, oral corticosteroid rescue, and the physicianâs global evaluation. The findings of these exploratory efficacy evaluations, along with pharmacokinetics and extrapolation of efficacy data from older patients, support the overall conclusion that montelukast sodium is efficacious in the maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 2 to 5 years of age.Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV<sub>1</sub>Â of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92.0% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (pâ¤0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub>Â compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV<sub>1</sub>, daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and âas-neededâ Î²-agonist requirements.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluatedÂ <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_bacabe14-6c84-4d06-b0d5-8b6fcabfb67b">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</linkHtml>]</content>.Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of montelukast 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast sodium 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV<sub>1</sub>Â following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B and Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast sodium 10 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 7 and are representative of the results from the other two studies.Â </paragraph>

Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV<sub>1</sub> after exercise (i.e., â¥20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied.

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5,029 patients, of whom 1,799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10 mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast sodium tablets, loratadine and placebo are shown in TABLE 9. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian and 1.0% other origins. Montelukast sodium 10 mg tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 10); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and sneezing).Â </paragraph>
