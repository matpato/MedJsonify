                     <title>5.1 Effects on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection <br/>
                     </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials, AVODART reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6Â months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in subjects with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. AVODART may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men taking AVODART, a new PSA baseline should be established at least 3Â months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on AVODART may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with AVODART may also affect PSA test results.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with AVODART for 3Â months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men. The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of AVODART. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving AVODART, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Coadministration of dutasteride and tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as dutasteride monotherapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In men aged 50 to 75Â years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2.5Â ng/mL and 10.0Â ng/mL taking AVODART in the 4-year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo (AVODART 1.0% versus placebo 0.5%) <content styleCode="italics">[see Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_4131515b-6f31-4a0e-967c-397434a8bf9e">1.3</linkHtml>), Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_d3170759-4ff1-47c9-93fd-d5240daec398">6.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5Â mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effects of dutasteride 0.5Â mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in healthy men throughout 52Â weeks of treatment and 24Â weeks of postâtreatment followâup. At 52Â weeks, compared with placebo, dutasteride treatment resulted in mean reduction in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility; the effects on total sperm count were not reversible after 24 weeks of follow-up. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected and mean values for all semen parameters remained within the normal range at all timepoints. The clinical significance of the effect of dutasteride on semen characteristics for an individual patientâs fertility is not known <content styleCode="italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#ID_bbedcb32-5326-455e-b3ea-ecb701e9c288">8.3</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (nÂ =Â 4,126) or 0.5-mg daily doses of AVODART (nÂ =Â 4,105) for up to 4Â years. The mean age was 63Â years and 91% were white. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4Â years of treatment or had âfor-cause biopsiesâ at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated.

Composite cardiac failure was also examined in a separate 4-year placebo-controlled trial evaluating AVODART in men at risk for development of prostate cancer. The incidence of cardiac failure in subjects taking AVODART was 0.6% (26/4,105) compared with 0.4% (15/4,126) in subjects on placebo. A majority of subjects with cardiac failure in both trials had comorbidities associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure. Therefore, the clinical significance of the numerical imbalances in cardiac failure is unknown. No causal relationship between AVODART alone or in combination with tamsulosin and cardiac failure has been established. No imbalance was observed in the incidence of overall cardiovascular adverse events in either trial.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>AVODART is contraindicated for use in pregnancy because it may cause harm to the male fetus <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#i4i_contraindications_id_f94e10b0-b985-4b99-9035-7530edfba125">4</linkHtml>)]</content>. AVODART is not indicated for use in women. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>AVODART is a 5 alphaâreductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. Abnormalities in the genitalia of male fetuses is an expected physiological consequence of inhibition of this conversion. These results are similar to observations in male infants with genetic 5 alphaâreductase deficiency.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, dutasteride inhibited normal development of external genitalia in male offspring when given to rats or rabbits during organogenesis at less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 0.5 mg daily, in the absence of maternal toxicity. At 15 times the MRHD, prolonged pregnancy, decreased reproductive organ weights, and delayed puberty in male offspring were observed in rats, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily. Increased placental weights in rabbits were also observed, with no-effect levels less than the MRHD of 0.5 mg daily <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although dutasteride is secreted into human semen, the drug concentration in the human female partner is approximately 100Â times less than concentrations producing abnormalities of male genitalia in animal studies <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. In monkeys dosed during organogenesis at blood concentrations comparable to or above levels to which a human female partner is estimated to be exposed, male offspring external genitalia was not adversely affected. No feminization occurred in male offspring of untreated female rats mated to treated male rats even though detectable blood levels of dutasteride were observed in the female rats <content styleCode="italics">[see Nonclinical Toxicology (<linkHtml href="#i4i_carcinogenesis_mutagenesis_fertility_id_0f920273-e572-4563-83dd-f79d7d097a1a">13.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Human Data:</content> The highest measured semen concentration of dutasteride in treated men was 14Â ng/mL. Although dutasteride is detected in semen, assuming exposure of a 50âkg woman to 5Â mL of semen and 100% absorption, the womanâs expected dutasteride blood concentration through semen would be about 0.0175Â ng/mL. This concentration is approximately 100Â times less than blood concentrations producing abnormalities of male genitalia in animal studies. Dutasteride is highly protein bound in human semen (greater than 96%), which may reduce the amount of dutasteride available for vaginal absorption.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Animal Data:</content> In an embryoâfetal development study in rats, oral administration of dutasteride at 10Â times less than the MRHD of 0.5Â mg daily (based on average blood levels in men) resulted in feminization of male genitalia in the fetus (decreased anogenital distance at 0.05Â mg/kg/day, with a lack of a no-effect level) in the absence of maternal toxicity. In addition, nipple development, hypospadias, and distended preputial glands occurred in fetuses of dams treated at doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day or greater (approximately 15 times the MRHD). Reduced fetal body weight and associated delayed ossification in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain) were observed at maternal exposure approximately 15Â times the MRHD (dose of 2.5Â mg/kg/day or greater). An increase in stillborn pups was observed in dams treated at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 111Â times the MRHD), with a no-effect level of 12.5 mg/kg/day. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a rabbit embryo-fetal development study, doses 28 times the MRHD (doses of 30Â mg/kg/day or greater), based on average blood levels in men, were administered orally on Gestation Days 7 to 29 (during organogenesis and the late period of external genitalia development). Histological evaluation of the genital papilla of fetuses revealed evidence of feminization of the male fetus as well as fused skull bones and increased placental weights at all doses in the absence of maternal toxicity. A second embryo-fetal development study in rabbits dosed throughout pregnancy (organogenesis and later period of external genitalia development [Gestation Days 6 to 29]) at 0.3 times the MRHD (doses of 0.05Â mg/kg/day or greater, with no no-effect level), also produced evidence of feminization of the genitalia in male fetuses and increased placental weights at all doses in the absence of maternal toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rhesus monkeys were exposed intravenously during organogenesis (Gestation Days 20 to 100) to a dutasteride blood level comparable to or above the estimated dutasteride exposure of a human female partner. Dutasteride was administered on Gestation Days 20 to 100 (during organogenesis) at doses of 400, 780, 1,325, or 2,010Â ng/day (12Â monkeys/group). No feminization of male external genitalia of monkey offspring was observed. Reduction of fetal adrenal weights, reduction in fetal prostate weights, and increases in fetal ovarian and testis weights were observed at the highest dose tested. Based on the highest measured semen concentration of dutasteride in treated men (14Â ng/mL), these doses in the monkey represent up to 16Â times the potential maximum exposure of a 50âkg human female to 5Â mL of semen daily from a dutasteride-treated male, assuming 100% absorption. The dose levels (on a ng/kg basis) administered to monkeys in this study are 32 to 186 times the nominal (ng/kg) dose to which a female would potentially be exposed via the semen. It is not known whether rabbits or rhesus monkeys produce any of the major human metabolites. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an oral pre- and post-natal development study in rats, feminization of the male genitalia was observed. Decreased anogenital distance was observed at 0.05 times the MRHD and greater (0.05 mg/kg/day and greater), with a lack of a no-effect level, based on average blood levels in men as an estimation of AUC. Hypospadias and nipple development were observed at 2.5 mg/kg/day or greater (14 times the MRHD or greater, with a no-effect level at 0.05 mg/kg/day). Doses of 2.5Â mg/kg/day and greater also resulted in prolonged gestation in the parental females, an increase in time to balano-preputial separation in male offspring, a decrease in time to vaginal patency for female offspring, and a decrease in prostate and seminal vesicle weights in male offspring. Increased stillbirths and decreased neonatal viability in offspring were noted at 30Â mg/kg/day (102 times the MRHD in the presence of maternal toxicity [decreased body weights]).</paragraph>

At 52 weeks, the mean percent reductions from baseline in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility were 23%, 26%, and 18%, respectively, in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected. After 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean percent change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23% lower than baseline. While mean values for all semen parameters at all timepoints remained within the normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change (30%), 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of greater than 90% from baseline at 52 weeks, with partial recovery at the 24-week follow-up.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>AVODART is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound that is a selective inhibitor of both the type 1 and type 2 isoforms of steroid 5 alpha-reductase, an intracellular enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Dutasteride is chemically designated as (5Î±,17Î²)-N-{2,5 bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl}-3-oxo-4-azaandrost-1-ene-17-carboxamide. The empirical formula of dutasteride is C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>30</sub>F<sub>6</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, representing a molecular weight of 528.5 with the following structural formula:</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Dutasteride is a white to pale yellow powder with a melting point of 242Â° to 250Â°C. It is soluble in ethanol (44Â mg/mL), methanol (64Â mg/mL), and polyethylene glycol 400 (3Â mg/mL), but it is insoluble in water.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each AVODART soft gelatin capsule, administered orally, contains 0.5Â mg of dutasteride dissolved in a mixture of mono-di-glycerides of caprylic/capric acid and butylated hydroxytoluene. The inactive excipients in the capsule shell are ferric oxide (yellow), gelatin (from certified BSE-free bovine sources), glycerin, and titanium dioxide. The soft gelatin capsules are printed with edible red ink.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to DHT. DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase, which exists as 2Â isoforms, typeÂ 1 and typeÂ 2. The typeÂ 2 isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues, while the typeÂ 1 isoenzyme is also responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both typeÂ 1 and typeÂ 2 5 alpha-reductase isoenzymes, with which it forms a stable enzyme complex. Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow. Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction of DHT is dose dependent and is observed within 1 to 2Â weeks. After 1 and 2Â weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0.5Â mg, median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85% and 90%, respectively. In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0.5Â mg/day for 4Â years, the median decrease in serum DHT was 94% at 1Â year, 93% at 2Â years, and 95% at both 3 and 4Â years. The median increase in serum testosterone was 19% at both 1 and 2Â years, 26% at 3Â years, and 22% at 4Â years, but the mean and median levels remained within the physiologic range.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with BPH treated with 5Â mg/day of dutasteride or placebo for up to 12Â weeks prior to transurethral resection of the prostate, mean DHT concentrations in prostatic tissue were significantly lower in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (784 and 5,793Â pg/g, respectively, <content styleCode="italics">P </content>&lt;0.001). Mean prostatic tissue concentrations of testosterone were significantly higher in the dutasteride group compared with placebo (2,073 and 93Â pg/g, respectively, <content styleCode="italics">P </content>&lt;0.001).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adult males with genetically inherited typeÂ 2 5 alpha-reductase deficiency also have decreased DHT levels. These 5 alpha-reductase-deficient males have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to 5 alpha-reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In healthy volunteers, 52Â weeks of treatment with dutasteride 0.5Â mg/day (nÂ =Â 26) resulted in no clinically significant change compared with placebo (nÂ =Â 23) in sex hormone-binding globulin, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroxine (free T4), and dehydroepiandrosterone. Statistically significant, baseline-adjusted mean increases compared with placebo were observed for total testosterone at 8Â weeks (97.1Â ng/dL, <content styleCode="italics">P </content>&lt;0.003) and thyroid-stimulating hormone at 52Â weeks (0.4Â mcIU/mL, <content styleCode="italics">P </content>&lt;0.05). The median percentage changes from baseline within the dutasteride group were 17.9% for testosterone at 8Â weeks and 12.4% for thyroid-stimulating hormone at 52Â weeks. After stopping dutasteride for 24Â weeks, the mean levels of testosterone and thyroid-stimulating hormone had returned to baseline in the group of subjects with available data at the visit. In subjects with BPH treated with dutasteride in a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, there was a median percent increase in luteinizing hormone of 12% at 6Â months and 19% at both 12 and 24Â months.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Plasma lipid panel and bone mineral density were evaluated following 52Â weeks of dutasteride 0.5Â mg once daily in healthy volunteers. There was no change in bone mineral density as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry compared with either placebo or baseline. In addition, the plasma lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins, triglycerides) was unaffected by dutasteride. No clinically significant changes in adrenal hormone responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation were observed in a subset population (nÂ =Â 13) of the 1-year healthy volunteer trial.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a trial of healthy subjects (nÂ =Â 26) receiving dutasteride 0.5Â mg/day for 12Â months, semen dutasteride concentrations averaged 3.4Â ng/mL (range: 0.4 to 14 ng/mL) at 12Â months and, similar to serum, achieved steady-state concentrations at 6Â months. On average, at 12Â months 11.5% of serum dutasteride concentrations partitioned into semen.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro studies showed that dutasteride is metabolized by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. Both of these isoenzymes produced the 4â²-hydroxydutasteride, 6-hydroxydutasteride, and the 6,4â²-dihydroxydutasteride metabolites. In addition, the 15-hydroxydutasteride metabolite was formed by CYP3A4. Dutasteride is not metabolized in vitro by human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. In human serum following dosing to steady state, unchanged dutasteride, 3Â major metabolites (4â²-hydroxydutasteride, 1,2-dihydrodutasteride, and 6-hydroxydutasteride), and 2Â minor metabolites (6,4â²-dihydroxydutasteride and 15-hydroxydutasteride), as assessed by mass spectrometric response, have been detected. The absolute stereochemistry of the hydroxyl additions in the 6 and 15Â positions is not known. In vitro, the 4â²-hydroxydutasteride and 1,2-dihydrodutasteride metabolites are much less potent than dutasteride against both isoforms of human 5 alpha-reductase. The activity of 6Î²-hydroxydutasteride is comparable to that of dutasteride.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dutasteride and its metabolites were excreted mainly in feces. As a percent of dose, there was approximately 5% unchanged dutasteride (~1% to ~15%) and 40% as dutasteride-related metabolites (~2% to ~90%). Only trace amounts of unchanged dutasteride were found in urine (&lt;1%). Therefore, on average, the dose unaccounted for approximated 55% (range: 5% to 97%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The terminal elimination half-life of dutasteride is approximately 5Â weeks at steady state. The average steady-state serum dutasteride concentration was 40Â ng/mL following 0.5Â mg/day for 1Â year. Following daily dosing, dutasteride serum concentrations achieve 65% of steady-state concentration after 1Â month and approximately 90% after 3Â months. Due to the long half-life of dutasteride, serum concentrations remain detectable (greater than 0.1Â ng/mL) for up to 4 to 6Â months after discontinuation of treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in B6C3F1 mice at doses of 3, 35, 250, and 500Â mg/kg/day for males and 3, 35, and 250Â mg/kg/day for females; an increased incidence of benign hepatocellular adenomas was noted at 250Â mg/kg/day (290-fold the MRHD of a 0.5-mg daily dose) in female mice only. Two of the 3Â major human metabolites have been detected in mice. The exposure to these metabolites in mice is either lower than in humans or is not known.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Han Wistar rats, at doses of 1.5, 7.5, and 53Â mg/kg/day in males and 0.8, 6.3, and 15Â mg/kg/day in females, there was an increase in Leydig cell adenomas in the testes at 135-fold the MRHD (53Â mg/kg/day and greater). An increased incidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia was present at 52-fold the MRHD (male rat doses of 7.5Â mg/kg/day and greater). A positive correlation between proliferative changes in the Leydig cells and an increase in circulating luteinizing hormone levels has been demonstrated with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and is consistent with an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis following 5 alpha-reductase inhibition. At tumorigenic doses, luteinizing hormone levels in rats were increased by 167%. In this study, the major human metabolites were tested for carcinogenicity at approximately 1 to 3Â times the expected clinical exposure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Treatment of sexually mature male rats with dutasteride at 0.1 times the MRHD (animal doses of 0.05Â mg/kg/day or greater for up to 31Â weeks) based on mean serum concentration resulted in dose- and timeâdependent decreases in fertility at all doses; reduced cauda epididymal (absolute) sperm counts but not sperm concentration (at 50 and 500Â mg/kg/day); reduced weights of the epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicles; and microscopic changes (cytoplasmic vacuolation of tubular epithelium in the epididymides and/or decreased cytoplasmic content of epithelium, consistent with decreased secretory activity in the prostate and seminal vesicles) in the reproductive organs at all doses in the absence of paternal toxicity. The fertility effects were reversed by Recovery Week 6 at all doses, and sperm counts were normal at the end of a 14âweek recovery period. The microscopic changes were no longer present at Recovery Week 14 at 0.1 times the MRHD and were partly recovered in the remaining treatment groups. Low levels of dutasteride (0.6 to 17Â ng/mL) were detected in the serum of untreated female rats mated to treated males (10 to 500Â mg/kg/day for 29 to 30Â weeks) which are 16 to 110 times the MRHD based on mean serum concentration. No feminization occurred in male offspring of untreated female rats mated to treated male rats even though detectable blood levels of dutasteride were observed in the female rats.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a fertility study in female rats with dosing 4 weeks prior to mating through early gestation, oral administration of dutasteride at doses of 0.05, 2.5, 12.5, and 30Â mg/kg/day resulted in reduced litter size due to increased resorptions and in feminization of male fetuses (decreased anogenital distance) at 2- to 10 times the MRHD (animal doses of 2.5Â mg/kg/day or greater) based on mean serum concentration, in the presence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain). Fetal body weights were also reduced at approximately 0.02 times the MRHD (rat dose of 0.05Â mg/kg/day or greater) based on mean serum concentration, with no no-effect level, in the absence of maternal toxicity.</paragraph>

Most of the 4,325Â subjects randomly assigned to receive either dutasteride or placebo completed 2Â years of doubleâblind treatment (70% and 67%, respectively).

                        <paragraph>Symptoms were quantified using the AUA-SI, a questionnaire that evaluates urinary symptoms (incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for a total possible score of 35, with higher numerical total symptom scores representing greater severity of symptoms. The baseline AUA-SI score across the 3Â trials was approximately 17Â units in both treatment groups. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Subjects receiving dutasteride achieved statistically significant improvement in symptoms versus placebo by MonthÂ 3 in 1 trial and by MonthÂ 12 in the other 2Â pivotal trials. At MonthÂ 12, the mean decrease from baseline in AUAâSI total symptom scores across the 3Â trials pooled was â3.3Â units for dutasteride and â2.0Â units for placebo with a mean difference between the 2Â treatment groups of â1.3 (range: â1.1 to â1.5Â units in each of the 3Â trials, <content styleCode="italics">PÂ </content>&lt;0.001) and was consistent across the 3Â trials.

                        <paragraph>Data from 3Â large, well-controlled efficacy trials demonstrate that treatment with AVODART (0.5Â mg once daily) reduces the risk of both AUR and BPH-related surgical intervention relative to placebo, improves BPH-related symptoms, decreases prostate volume, and increases maximum urinary flow rates. These data suggest that AVODART arrests the disease process of BPH in men with an enlarged prostate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of combination therapy (AVODART 0.5Â mg/day plus tamsulosin 0.4Â mg/day, nÂ =Â 1,610) was compared with AVODART alone (nÂ =Â 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (nÂ =Â 1,611) in a 4âyear multicenter, randomized, doubleâblind trial. Trial entry criteria were similar to the doubleâblind, placeboâcontrolled monotherapy efficacy trials described in Section 14.1. Eightyâeight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5 alphaâreductaseâinhibitor or alpha-adrenergicâantagonist treatment. Of the 4,844Â subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the combination group, 67% in the group receiving AVODART, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4Â years of doubleâblind treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Symptoms were quantified using the first 7Â questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (identical to the AUAâSI). The baseline score was approximately 16.4Â units for each treatment group. Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at MonthÂ 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At MonthÂ 24 the mean changes from baseline (Â±SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (Â±7.14) for combination, -4.9 (Â±6.81) for AVODART, and -4.3 (Â±7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between combination and AVODART of â1.3Â units (<content styleCode="italics">PÂ </content>&lt;0.001; [95% CI: â1.69, â0.86]), and between combination and tamsulosin of â1.8Â units (<content styleCode="italics">PÂ </content>&lt;0.001; [95% CI: â2.23, â1.40]).

AVODART lowers DHT production in the body, leading to shrinkage of the enlarged prostate in most men. While some men have fewer problems and symptoms after 3Â months of treatment with AVODART, a treatment period of at least 6 months is usually necessary to see if AVODART will work for you.</paragraph>

A blood test called PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is sometimes used to see if you might have prostate cancer. AVODART will reduce the amount of PSA measured in your blood. Your healthcare provider is aware of this effect and can still use PSA to see if you might have prostate cancer. Increases in your PSA levels while on treatment with AVODART (even if the PSA levels are in the normal range) should be evaluated by your healthcare provider.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>These are not all the possible side effects of AVODART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1â800âFDAâ1088.</paragraph>
