                           <item>Tocilizumab-anoh for subcutaneous injection is not intended for intravenous drip infusion.<br/>Assess suitability of patient for subcutaneous home use and instruct patients to inform a healthcare professional before administering the next dose if they experience any symptoms of allergic reaction. Patients should seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms of serious allergic reactions. Tocilizumab-anoh subcutaneous injection is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare practitioner. After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, a patient may self-inject Tocilizumab-anoh or the patient's caregiver may administer Tocilizumab-anoh if a healthcare practitioner determines that it is appropriate. PJIA and SJIA patients may self-inject with the Tocilizumab-anoh prefilled syringe or prefilled autoinjector, or the patient's caregiver may administer Tocilizumab-anoh if both the healthcare practitioner and the parent/legal guardian determines it is appropriate <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S8.4">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</linkHtml>]</content>. Patients, or patient caregivers, should be instructed to follow the directions provided in the Instructions for Use (IFU) for additional details on medication administration.</item>
                           <item>Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use Tocilizumab-anoh prefilled syringes (PFS) or prefilled autoinjector (AI) exhibiting particulate matter, cloudiness, or discoloration. Tocilizumab-anoh for subcutaneous administration should be clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to yellow. Do not use if any part of the PFS or AI appears to be damaged.</item>
                           <item>Patients using Tocilizumab-anoh for subcutaneous administration should be instructed to inject the full amount in the syringe (0.9 mL) or full amount in the autoinjector (0.9 mL), which provides 162 mg of Tocilizumab-anoh, according to the directions provided in the IFU.</item>
                           <item>Injection sites should be rotated with each injection and should never be given into moles, scars, or areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, or not intact.</item>

Dose interruptions of Tocilizumab-anoh are recommended for liver enzyme abnormalities, low neutrophil counts, and low platelet counts in patients with PJIA and SJIA at levels similar to what is outlined above for patients with RA and GCA. If appropriate, dose modify or stop concomitant methotrexate and/or other medications and hold Tocilizumab-anoh dosing until the clinical situation has been evaluated. In PJIA and SJIA the decision to discontinue Tocilizumab-anoh for a laboratory abnormality should be based upon the medical assessment of the individual patient.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including  tocilizumab products. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystosis were reported with  tocilizumab products. Other serious infections, not reported in clinical studies, may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, listeriosis). Patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids which in addition to rheumatoid arthritis may predispose them to infections.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.3	Hepatotoxicity</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking intravenous or subcutaneous tocilizumab products. Some of these cases have resulted in liver transplant or death. Time to onset for cases ranged from months to years after treatment initiation with tocilizumab products. While most cases presented with marked elevations of transaminases (&gt; 5 times ULN), some cases presented with signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction and only mildly elevated transaminases.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During randomized controlled studies, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations<content styleCode="italics"> [see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S6.2">6.2</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S6.5">6.5</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S6.7">6.7)</linkHtml>].</content> Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with tocilizumab.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For RA and GCA patients, obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) before initiating Tocilizumab-anoh, every 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy for the first 6 months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. It is not recommended to initiate Tocilizumab-anoh treatment in RA or GCA patients with elevated transaminases ALT or AST greater than 1.5× ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT or AST greater than 5× ULN, discontinue Tocilizumab-anoh. For recommended modifications based upon increase in transaminases <content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#S2.9">Dosage and Administration (2.9)</linkHtml>
                           </content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may have elevated ALT or AST levels. Multi-organ failure with involvement of the liver is recognized as a complication of severe COVID-19. The decision to administer Tocilizumab-anoh should balance the potential benefit of treating COVID-19 against the potential risks of acute treatment with Tocilizumab-anoh. It is not recommended to initiate Tocilizumab-anoh treatment in COVID-19 patients with elevated ALT or AST above 10 × ULN. Monitor ALT and AST during treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, such as fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (e.g., ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, serum total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range), Tocilizumab-anoh treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Tocilizumab-anoh should only be restarted in patients with another explanation for the liver test abnormalities after normalization of the liver tests.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A similar pattern of liver enzyme elevation is noted with tocilizumab products treatment in the PJIA and SJIA populations. Monitor liver test panel at the time of the second administration and thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks for PJIA and every 2 to 4 weeks for SJIA.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in association with tocilizumab products and anaphylactic events with a fatal outcome have been reported with intravenous infusion of tocilizumab products. Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) of patients in the 6-month controlled trials of intravenous tocilizumab, 0.2% (8 out of 4009) of patients in the intravenous all-exposure RA population, 0.7% (8 out of 1068) in the subcutaneous 6-month controlled RA trials, and in 0.7% (10 out of 1465) of patients in the subcutaneous all- exposure population. In the SJIA controlled trial with intravenous tocilizumab, 1 out of 112 patients (0.9%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. In the PJIA controlled trial with intravenous tocilizumab, 0 out of 188 patients (0%) in the tocilizumab all-exposure population experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. Reactions that required treatment discontinuation included generalized erythema, rash, and urticaria. Injection site reactions were categorized separately <content styleCode="italics">[</content>s<content styleCode="italics">ee <linkHtml href="#S6">Adverse Reactions (6)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the postmarketing setting, events of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death have occurred in patients treated with a range of doses of intravenous tocilizumab products, with or without concomitant therapies. Events have occurred in patients who received premedication. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis events, have occurred both with and without previous hypersensitivity reactions and as early as the first infusion of tocilizumab products <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.10">Adverse Reactions (6.10)</linkHtml>]</content>. In addition, serious cutaneous reactions, including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), have been reported in patients with autoinflammatory conditions treated with tocilizumab products.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tocilizumab-anoh for intravenous use should only be infused by a healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis. For Tocilizumab-anoh subcutaneous injection, advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue Tocilizumab-anoh, treat promptly and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The tocilizumab-IV data in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) includes 5 double-blind, controlled, multicenter studies. In these studies, patients received doses of tocilizumab-IV 8 mg per kg monotherapy (288 patients), tocilizumab- IV 8 mg per kg in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate) (1582 patients), or tocilizumab-IV 4 mg per kg in combination with methotrexate (774 patients).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The all exposure population includes all patients in registration studies who received at least one dose of tocilizumab-IV. Of the 4009 patients in this population, 3577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3309 for at least one year; 2954 received treatment for at least 2 years and 2189 for 3 years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients in these studies had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The study population had a mean age of 52 years, 82% were female and 74% were Caucasian.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in controlled studies up to 24 weeks (occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with tocilizumab-IV monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was 5% for patients taking tocilizumab-IV and 3% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that required discontinuation of tocilizumab-IV were increased hepatic transaminase values (per protocol requirement) and serious infections.</paragraph>

                     <title>6.2	Clinical Trials Experience in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Treated with Subcutaneous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-SC)</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The tocilizumab-SC data in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) includes 2 double-blind, controlled, multicenter studies. Study SC-I was a non-inferiority study that compared the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab 162 mg administered every week subcutaneously and 8 mg/kg intravenously every four weeks in 1262 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. Study SC-II was a placebo controlled superiority study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab 162 mg administered every other week subcutaneously or placebo in 656 patients. All patients in both studies received background non-biologic DMARDs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety observed for tocilizumab-SC administered subcutaneously was consistent with the known safety profile of intravenous tocilizumab, with the exception of injection site reactions (ISRs), which were more common with tocilizumab-SC compared with placebo SC injections (IV arm).</paragraph>

In SC-II, the frequency of ISRs was 7.1% (31/437) and 4.1% (9/218) for the every other week tocilizumab-SC and placebo groups, respectively. These ISRs (including erythema, pruritus, pain and hematoma) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority resolved without any treatment and none necessitated drug discontinuation.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety of subcutaneous tocilizumab has been studied in one Phase III study (WA28119) with 251 GCA patients. The total patient years duration in the tocilizumab-SC GCA all exposure population was 138.5 patient years during the 12-month double blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. The overall safety profile observed in the tocilizumab-SC treatment groups was generally consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab. There was an overall higher incidence of infections in GCA patients relative to RA patients. The rate of infection/serious infection events was 200.2/9.7 events per 100 patient years in the tocilizumab-SC weekly group and 160.2/4.4 events per 100 patient years in the tocilizumab-SC every other week group as compared to 156.0/4.2 events per 100 patient years in the placebo + 26 week prednisone taper and 210.2/12.5 events per 100 patient years in the placebo + 52 week taper groups.</paragraph>

                     <title>6.6	Clinical Trials Experience in Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated with Subcutaneous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-SC)</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety of tocilizumab-SC was studied in 52 pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age with PJIA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to methotrexate. The total patient exposure in the PJIA tocilizumab-SC population (defined as patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab-SC and accounting for treatment discontinuation) was 49.5 patient years. In general, the safety observed for tocilizumab administered subcutaneously was consistent with the known safety profile of intravenous tocilizumab, with the exception of injection site reactions (ISRs), and neutropenia.</paragraph>

These ISRs occurred in a greater proportion of patients at or above 30 kg (44.0%) compared with patients below 30 kg (14.8%). All ISRs were mild in severity and none of the ISRs required patient withdrawal from treatment or dose interruption.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The data described below reflect exposure to tocilizumab-IV in one randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of 112 pediatric patients with SJIA 2 to 17 years of age who had an inadequate clinical response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking 0.3 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or more, and almost 70% were taking methotrexate. The trial included a 12 week controlled phase followed by an open-label extension. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled portion of the clinical study 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab- IV (8 or 12 mg per kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab-IV in the open-label extension phase.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse events (at least 5%) seen in tocilizumab-IV treated patients in the 12 week controlled portion of the study were: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In the 12 week controlled study, no patient in any treatment group experienced macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) while on assigned treatment; 3 per 112 (3%) developed MAS during open-label treatment with tocilizumab-IV. One patient in the placebo group escaped to tocilizumab-IV 12 mg per kg at Week 2 due to severe disease activity, and ultimately developed MAS at Day 70. Two additional patients developed MAS during the long-term extension. All 3 patients had tocilizumab-IV dose interrupted (2 patients) or discontinued (1 patient) for the MAS event, received treatment, and the MAS resolved without sequelae. Based on a limited number of cases, the incidence of MAS does not appear to be elevated in the tocilizumab-IV SJIA clinical development experience; however no definitive conclusions can be made.</paragraph>

                     <title>7.2	Interactions with CYP450 Substrates</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cytochrome P450s in the liver are down-regulated by infection and inflammation stimuli including cytokines such as IL-6. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling in RA patients treated with tocilizumab products may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels than those in the absence of tocilizumab products leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. In vitro studies showed that tocilizumab has the potential to affect expression of multiple CYP enzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Its effect on CYP2C8 or transporters is unknown. In vivo studies with omeprazole, metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and simvastatin, metabolized by CYP3A4, showed up to a 28% and 57% decrease in exposure one week following a single dose of tocilizumab, respectively. The effect of tocilizumab products on CYP enzymes may be clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of Tocilizumab-anoh, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, perform therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as needed. Exercise caution when coadministering Tocilizumab-anoh with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, lovastatin, atorvastatin, etc. The effect of tocilizumab products on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The available data with tocilizumab products from a pregnancy exposure registry, retrospective cohort study, pharmacovigilance, and published literature are insufficient to draw conclusions about a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. These studies had methodological limitations, including small sample size of tocilizumab exposed groups, missing exposure and outcomes information, and lack of adjustment for cofounders. Monoclonal antibodies, such as tocilizumab products, are actively transported across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the <content styleCode="italics">in utero </content>exposed infant <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#CC">Clinical Considerations</linkHtml>]. </content>In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of tocilizumab to Cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis caused abortion/embryo-fetal death at doses 1.25 times and higher than the maximum recommended human dose by the intravenous route of 8 mg per kg every 2 to 4 weeks. The literature in animals suggests that inhibition of IL-6 signaling may interfere with cervical ripening and dilatation and myometrial contractile activity leading to potential delays of parturition<content styleCode="italics"> [see <linkHtml href="#data">Data</linkHtml>]</content>.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>An embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study was performed in which pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys were treated intravenously with tocilizumab at daily doses of 2, 10, or 50 mg/ kg during organogenesis from gestation day (GD) 20-50. Although there was no evidence for a teratogenic/dysmorphogenic effect at any dose, tocilizumab produced an increase in the incidence of abortion/embryo-fetal death at doses 1.25 times and higher the MRHD by the intravenous route at maternal intravenous doses of 10 and 50 mg/ kg. Testing of a murine analogue of tocilizumab in mice did not yield any evidence of harm to offspring during the pre- and postnatal development phase when dosed at 50 mg/kg intravenously with treatment every three days from implantation (GD 6) until post-partum day 21 (weaning). There was no evidence for any functional impairment of the development and behavior, learning ability, immune competence and fertility of the offspring.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Parturition is associated with significant increases of IL-6 in the cervix and myometrium. The literature suggests that inhibition of IL-6 signaling may interfere with cervical ripening and dilatation and myometrial contractile activity leading to potential delays of parturition. For mice deficient in IL-6 (ll6<sup>-/-</sup> null mice), parturition was delayed relative to wild-type (ll6<sup>+/+</sup>) mice. Administration of recombinant IL-6 to ll6<sup>-/-</sup> null mice restored the normal timing of delivery.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>No information is available on the presence of tocilizumab products in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) is present in human milk. If tocilizumab products are transferred into human milk, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract and potential limited systemic exposure in the infant to tocilizumab products are unknown. The lack of clinical data during lactation precludes clear determination of the risk of tocilizumab products to an infant during lactation; therefore the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Tocilizumab-anoh and the potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Tocilizumab-anoh or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tocilizumab products bind to both soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R), and have been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. IL-6 is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts. IL-6 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes such as T-cell activation, induction of immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation and differentiation. IL-6 is also produced by synovial and endothelial cells leading to local production of IL-6 in joints affected by inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In clinical studies in RA patients with the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg intravenous doses or the 162 mg weekly and every other weekly subcutaneous doses of tocilizumab, decreases in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) to within normal ranges were seen as early as week 2. Changes in pharmacodynamic parameters were observed (i.e., decreases in rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A, fibrinogen and increases in hemoglobin) with doses, however the greatest improvements were observed with 8 mg per kg tocilizumab. Pharmacodynamic changes were also observed to occur after tocilizumab administration in GCA, PJIA, and SJIA patients (decreases in CRP, ESR, and increases in hemoglobin). The relationship between these pharmacodynamic findings and clinical efficacy is not known.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy subjects administered tocilizumab in doses from 2 to 28 mg per kg intravenously and 81 to 162 mg subcutaneously, absolute neutrophil counts decreased to the nadir 3 to 5 days following tocilizumab administration. Thereafter, neutrophils recovered towards baseline in a dose dependent manner.

                        <paragraph>PK of tocilizumab is characterized by nonlinear elimination which is a combination of linear clearance and Michaelis-Menten elimination. The nonlinear part of tocilizumab elimination leads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional. The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab do not change with time. Due to the dependence of total clearance on tocilizumab serum concentrations, the half-life of tocilizumab is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on the serum concentration level. Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so far indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and RA patients suggest that PK is similar between the two populations.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The population PK model was developed from an analysis dataset composed of an IV dataset of 1793 patients from Study I, Study III, Study IV, and Study V, and from an IV and SC dataset of 1759 patients from Studies SC- I and SC-II. C<sub>mean</sub> is included in place of AUCtau, since for dosing regimens with different inter-dose intervals, the mean concentration over the dosing period characterizes the comparative exposure better than AUCtau.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>At high serum concentrations, when total clearance of tocilizumab is dominated by linear clearance, a terminal half-life of approximately 21.5 days was derived from the population parameter estimates.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For doses of 4 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab at steady state were 86.1 (44.8–202) mcg/mL, 0.1 (0.0–14.6) mcg/mL, and 18.0 (8.9– 50.7) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 176 (75.4–557) mcg/mL, 13.4 (0.1–154) mcg/mL, and 54.0 (17–260) mcg/mL, respectively. C<sub>max</sub> increased dose-proportionally between doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks, while a greater than dose-proportional increase was observed in C<sub>mean</sub> and C<sub>trough</sub>. At steady-state, C<sub>mean</sub> and C<sub>trough</sub> were 3.0 and 134 fold higher at 8 mg/kg as compared to 4 mg/kg, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The accumulation ratios for AUC and C<sub>max</sub> after multiple doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg IV Q4W are low, while the accumulation ratios for C<sub>trough</sub> are higher (2.62 and 2.47, respectively). For C<sub>max</sub>, greater than 90% of the steady- state value was reached after the 1st IV infusion. For AUCtau and C<sub>mean</sub>, 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 1st and 3rd infusion for 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg IV, while for C<sub>trough</sub>, approximately 90% of the steady- state value was reached after the 4th IV infusion after both doses.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For doses of 162 mg given every other week subcutaneously, the estimated median (range) steady-state C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub>  of tocilizumab were  12.1 (0.4–49.3) mcg/mL, 4.1 (0.0–34.2) mcg/mL, and 9.2 (0.2– 43.6) mcg/mL, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For doses of 162 mg given every week subcutaneously, the estimated median (range) steady-state C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 49.8 (3–150) mcg/mL, 42.9 (1.3–144) mcg/mL, and 47.3 (2.4–147) mcg/mL, respectively. Exposures after the 162 mg SC QW regimen were greater by 5.1 (C<sub>mean</sub>) to 10.5 fold (C<sub>trough</sub>) compared to the 162 mg SC Q2W regimen.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Accumulation ratios after multiple doses of either SC regimen were higher than after IV regimen with the highest ratios for C<sub>trough</sub> (6.02 and 6.30, for 162 mg SC Q2W and 162 mg SC QW, respectively). The higher accumulation for C<sub>trough</sub> was expected based on the nonlinear clearance contribution at lower concentrations. For C<sub>max</sub>, greater than 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 5th SC and the 12th SC injection with the Q2W and QW regimens, respectively. For AUCtau and C<sub>mean</sub>, 90% of the steady-state value was reached after the 6th and 12th injections for the 162 mg SC Q2W and QW regimens, respectively. For C<sub>trough</sub>, approximately 90% of the steady- state value was reached after the 6th and 12th injections for the 162 mg SC Q2W and QW regimens, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Population PK analysis identified body weight as a significant covariate impacting the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. When given IV on a mg/kg basis, individuals with body weight ≥ 100 kg are predicted to have mean steady-state exposures higher than mean values for the patient population. Therefore, tocilizumab doses exceeding 800 mg per infusion are not recommended in patients with RA <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.2">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. Due to the flat dosing employed for SC administration of tocilizumab, no modifications are necessary by this dosing route.</paragraph>

The accumulation ratios for C<sub>mean</sub> or AUCtau, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> were 10.9, 9.6, and 8.9, respectively. Steady state was reached after 17 weeks.

The accumulation ratios for C<sub>mean</sub> or AUCtau, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> were 2.8, 5.6, and 2.3 respectively. Steady-state was reached after 14 weeks.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab IV in GCA patients was characterized by a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis which included 22 patients treated with 6 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. The median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub> and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab at steady state were 178 (115-320) mcg/mL, 22.7 (3.38-54.5) mcg/mL and 57.5 (32.9-110) mcg/mL, respectively. Steady state trough concentrations were within the range observed in GCA patients treated with 162 mg TCZ SC administered every week or every other week.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab (TCZ) in PJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 188 patients who were treated with TCZ IV or 52 patients treated with TCZ SC.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight at or above 30 kg) given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab at steady state were 181 (114–331) mcg/mL, 3.28 (0.02–35.4) mcg/mL, and 38.6 (22.2–83.8) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight less than 30 kg) given every 4 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 167 (125–220) mcg/mL, 0.35 (0– 11.8) mcg/mL, and 30.8 (16.0–48.0) mcg/mL, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The accumulation ratios were 1.05 and 1.16 for AUC<sub>4weeks</sub>, and 1.43 and 2.22 for C<sub>trough</sub> for 10 mg/kg (BW less than 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (BW at or above 30 kg) intravenous doses, respectively. No accumulation for C<sub>max</sub> was observed. Following 10 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg TCZ IV every 4 weeks doses in PJIA patients (aged 2 to 17 years), steady state concentrations (trough and average) were within the range of exposures in adult RA patients following 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, and steady state peak concentrations in PJIA patients were comparable to those following 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks in adult RA patients.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For doses of 162 mg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight at or above 30 kg) given every 2 weeks subcutaneously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 29.7 (7.56– 50.3) mcg/mL, 12.7 (0.19–23.8) mcg/mL, and 23.0 (3.86–36.9) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 162 mg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight less than 30 kg) given every 3 weeks subcutaneously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 62.4 (39.4–121) mcg/mL, 13.4 (0.21– 52.3) mcg/mL, and 35.7 (17.4–91.8) mcg/mL, respectively.</paragraph>

Following subcutaneous dosing, steady state C<sub>trough</sub> was comparable for patients in the two body weight groups, while steady-state C<sub>max</sub> and C<sub>mean</sub> were higher for patients in the less than 30 kg group compared to the group at or above 30 kg. All patients treated with TCZ SC had steady-state C<sub>trough</sub> at or higher than that achieved with TCZ IV across the spectrum of body weights.

                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab (TCZ) in SJIA patients was characterized by a population pharmacokinetic analysis which included 89 patients who were treated with TCZ IV or 51 patients treated with TCZ SC.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For doses of 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight at or above 30 kg) given every 2 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 253 (120– 404) mcg/mL, 70.7 (5.26–127) mcg/mL, and 117 (37.6–199) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 12 mg/kg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight less than 30 kg) given every 2 weeks intravenously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 274 (149–444) mcg/mL, 65.9 (19.0–135) mcg/mL, and 124 (60–194) mcg/mL, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The accumulation ratios were 1.95 and 2.01 for AUC<sub>4weeks</sub>, and 3.41 and 3.20 for C<sub>trough</sub> for 12 mg/kg (BW less than 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (BW at or above 30 kg) intravenous doses, respectively. Accumulation data for C<sub>max</sub> were 1.37 and 1.42 for 12 mg/kg (BW less than 30 kg) and 8 mg/kg (BW at or above 30 kg) intravenous doses, respectively. Following every other week dosing with tocilizumab IV, steady state was reached by 8 weeks for both body weight groups. Mean estimated tocilizumab exposure parameters were similar between the two dose groups defined by body weight.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For doses of 162 mg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight at or above 30 kg) given every week subcutaneously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 89.8 (26.4– 190) mcg/mL, 72.4 (19.5–158) mcg/mL, and 82.4 (23.9–169) mcg/mL, respectively. For doses of 162 mg tocilizumab (patients with a body weight less than 30 kg) given every 2 weeks subcutaneously, the estimated median (range) C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>trough</sub>, and C<sub>mean</sub> of tocilizumab were 127 (51.7–266) mcg/mL, 64.2 (16.6–136) mcg/mL, and 92.7 (38.5–199) mcg/mL, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The accumulation ratios were 2.27 and 4.28 for AUC<sub>4weeks</sub>, 3.21 and 4.39 for C<sub>trough</sub>, and 1.88 and 3.66 for C<sub>max</sub>, for 162 mg given every 2 weeks (BW less than 30 kg) and 162 mg given every week (BW at or above 30 kg) subcutaneous doses, respectively. Following subcutaneous dosing, steady state was reached by 12 weeks for both body weight groups. All patients treated with tocilizumab SC had steady-state C<sub>max</sub> lower than that achieved with tocilizumab IV across the spectrum of body weights. Trough and mean concentrations in patients after SC dosing were similar to those achieved with tocilizumab IV across body weights.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Tocilizumab is eliminated by a combination of linear clearance and nonlinear elimination. The concentration- dependent nonlinear elimination plays a major role at low tocilizumab concentrations. Once the nonlinear pathway is saturated, at higher tocilizumab concentrations, clearance is mainly determined by the linear clearance. The saturation of the nonlinear elimination leads to an increase in exposure that is more than dose-proportional. The pharmacokinetic parameters of tocilizumab do not change with time.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Population pharmacokinetic analyses in any patient population tested so far indicate no relationship between apparent clearance and the presence of anti-drug antibodies.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The linear clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was estimated to be 12.5 mL per h in RA patients, 6.7 mL per h in GCA patients, 5.8 mL per h in pediatric patients with PJIA, and 5.7 mL per h in pediatric patients with SJIA. In COVID-19 patients, serum concentrations were below the limit of quantification after 35 days on average following one infusion of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously. The average linear clearance in the population pharmacokinetic analysis was estimated to be 17.6 mL per hour in patients with baseline ordinal scale category 3 (OS 3, patients requiring supplemental oxygen), 22.5 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 4 (patients requiring high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation), 29 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 5 (patients requiring mechanical ventilation), and 35.4 mL per hour in patients with baseline OS 6 (patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or mechanical ventilation and additional organ support).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Due to the dependence of total clearance on tocilizumab serum concentrations, the half-life of tocilizumab is also concentration-dependent and varies depending on the serum concentration level.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>For intravenous administration in RA patients, the concentration-dependent apparent t1/2 is up to 11 days for 4 mg per kg and up to 13 days for 8 mg per kg every 4 weeks in patients with RA at steady-state. For subcutaneous administration in RA patients, the concentration-dependent apparent t<sub>1/2</sub> is up to 13 days for 162 mg every week and 5 days for 162 mg every other week in patients with RA at steady-state.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In GCA patients at steady state, the effective t<sub>1/2</sub> of tocilizumab varied between 18.3 and 18.9 days for 162 mg subcutaneously every week dosing regimen and between 4.2 and 7.9 days for 162 mg subcutaneously every other week dosing regimen. For intravenous administration in GCA patients, the TCZ concentration-dependent apparent t<sub>1/2</sub> was 13.2 days following 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The t<sub>1/2</sub> of tocilizumab in children with PJIA is up to 17 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight at or above 30 kg or 10 mg/kg for body weight below 30 kg) during a dosing interval at steady state. For subcutaneous administration, the t<sub>1/2</sub> of tocilizumab in PJIA patients is up to 10 days for the two body weight categories (every other week regimen for body weight at or above 30 kg or every 3 week regimen for body weight less than 30 kg) during a dosing interval at steady state.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The t<sub>1/2</sub> of tocilizumab intravenous in pediatric patients with SJIA is up to 16 days for the two body weight categories (8 mg/kg for body weight at or above 30 kg and 12 mg/kg for body weight below 30 kg every other week) during a dosing interval at steady-state. Following subcutaneous administration, the effective t<sub>1/2</sub> of tocilizumab subcutaneous in SJIA patients is up to 14 days for both the body weight categories (162 mg every week for body weight at or above 30 kg and 162 mg every two weeks for body weight below 30 kg) during a dosing interval at steady state.</paragraph>

                                          <paragraph>Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adult rheumatoid arthritis patients and GCA patients showed that age, gender and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tocilizumab. Linear clearance was found to increase with body size. In RA patients, the body weight-based dose (8 mg per kg) resulted in approximately 86% higher exposure in patients who are greater than 100 kg in comparison to patients who are less than 60 kg. There was an inverse relationship between tocilizumab exposure and body weight for flat dose subcutaneous regimens.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>In GCA patients treated with tocilizumab-SC, higher exposure was observed in patients with lower body weight. For the 162 mg every week subcutaneous dosing regimen, the steady-state C<sub>mean</sub> was 51% higher in patients with body weight less than 60 kg compared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. For the 162 mg every other week subcutaneous regimen, the steady-state C<sub>mean</sub> was 129% higher in patients with body weight less than 60 kg compared to patients weighing between 60 to 100 kg. There is limited data for patients above 100 kg (n=7).</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>In COVID-19 patients, exposure following body-weight-based intravenous dosing (8 mg per kg tocilizumab up to 100 kg body weight with a maximum dose of 800 mg) was dependent on body weight and disease severity assessed by an ordinal scale (OS). Within an OS category, compared to patients with a mean body weight of 80 kg, exposure was 20% lower in patients weighing less than 60 kg. Exposure in patients weighing more than 100 kg was in the same range as exposure in patients with a mean body weight of 80 kg. For an 80 kg patient, exposure decreases as OS category increases; for each category increase, exposure decreases by 13%.</paragraph>

                                          <paragraph>In vitro data suggested that IL-6 reduced mRNA expression for several CYP450 isoenzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and this reduced expression was reversed by co-incubation with tocilizumab at clinically relevant concentrations. Accordingly, inhibition of IL-6 signaling in RA patients treated with tocilizumab may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels than those in the absence of tocilizumab leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates. Its effect on CYP2C8 or transporters (e.g., P-gp) is unknown. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation of Tocilizumab-anoh, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as needed. Caution should be exercised when Tocilizumab-anoh is coadministered with drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives (CYP3A4 substrates)<content styleCode="italics"> [see <linkHtml href="#S7.2">Drug Interactions (7.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

In 12 RA patients not treated with tocilizumab, receiving 40 mg simvastatin, exposures of simvastatin and its metabolite, simvastatin acid, was 4- to 10-fold and 2-fold higher, respectively, than the exposures observed in healthy subjects. One week following administration of a single infusion of tocilizumab (10 mg per kg), exposure of simvastatin and simvastatin acid decreased by 57% and 39%, respectively, to exposures that were similar or slightly higher than those observed in healthy subjects. Exposures of simvastatin and simvastatin acid increased upon withdrawal of tocilizumab in RA patients. Selection of a particular dose of simvastatin in RA patients should take into account the potentially lower exposures that may result after initiation of Tocilizumab-anoh (due to normalization of CYP3A4) or higher exposures after discontinuation of Tocilizumab-anoh.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenicity potential of tocilizumab products. Literature indicates that the IL-6 pathway can mediate anti-tumor responses by promoting increased immune cell surveillance of the tumor microenvironment. However, available published evidence also supports that IL-6 signaling through the IL-6 receptor may be involved in pathways that lead to tumorigenesis. The malignancy risk in humans from an antibody that disrupts signaling through the IL-6 receptor, such as tocilizumab, is presently unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male and female mice that received a murine analogue of tocilizumab administered by the intravenous route at a dose of 50 mg/kg every three days.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of intravenously administered tocilizumab was assessed in five randomized, double-blind, multicenter studies in patients greater than 18 years with active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline.  Tocilizumab was given intravenously every 4 weeks as monotherapy (Study I), in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (Studies II and III) or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study IV) in patients with an inadequate response to those drugs, or in combination with MTX in patients with an inadequate response to TNF antagonists (Study V).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In Study II, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in total Sharp-Genant score and its components, the erosion score and joint space narrowing score. Radiographs of hands/wrists and forefeet were obtained at baseline, 24 weeks, 52 weeks, and 104 weeks and scored by readers unaware of treatments group and visit number. The results from baseline to week 52 are shown in <content styleCode="bold">Table 7</content>. Tocilizumab 4 mg per kg slowed (less than 75% inhibition compared to the control group) and tocilizumab 8 mg per kg inhibited (at least 75% inhibition compared to the control group) the progression of structural damage compared to placebo plus MTX at week 52.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In Study II, physical function and disability were assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Both dosing groups of tocilizumab demonstrated a greater improvement compared to the placebo group in the AUC of change from baseline in the HAQ-DI through week 52. The mean change from baseline to week 52 in HAQ-DI was 0.6, 0.5, and 0.4 for tocilizumab 8 mg per kg,  tocilizumab 4 mg per kg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Sixty-three percent (63%) and sixty percent (60%) of patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg per kg and tocilizumab 4 mg per kg treatment groups, respectively, achieved a clinically relevant improvement in HAQ-DI (change from baseline of ≥ 0.3 units) at week 52 compared to 53% in the placebo treatment group.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Study WA25204 (NCT01331837) was a randomized, open-label (sponsor-blinded), 2-arm parallel-group, multicenter, non-inferiority, cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial in patients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe RA. This CV safety study was designed to exclude a moderate increase in CV risk in patients treated with tocilizumab compared with a TNF inhibitor standard of care (etanercept).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The study included 3,080 seropositive RA patients with active disease and an inadequate response to non- biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, who were aged ≥50 years with at least one additional CV risk factor beyond RA. Patients were randomized 1:1 to IV tocilizumab 8 mg/kg Q4W or SC etanercept 50 mg QW and followed for an average of 3.2 years. The primary endpoint was the comparison of the time-to-first occurrence of any component of a composite of major adverse CV events (MACE; non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or CV death), with the final intent-to-treat analysis based on a total of 161 confirmed CV events (83/1538 [5.4%] for tocilizumab; 78/1542 [5.1%] for etanercept) reviewed by an independent and blinded adjudication committee.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Non-inferiority of tocilizumab to etanercept for cardiovascular risk was determined by excluding &gt;80% relative increase in the risk of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of MACE comparing tocilizumab to etanercept was 1.05; 95% CI (0.77, 1.43).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered tocilizumab was assessed in two double-blind, controlled, multicenter studies in patients with active RA. One study, SC-I (<linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT01194414">NCT01194414</linkHtml>), was a non-inferiority study that compared the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab 162 mg administered every week subcutaneously to 8 mg per kg intravenously every four weeks. The second study, SC-II (<linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT01232569">NCT01232569</linkHtml>), was a placebo controlled superiority study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab 162 mg administered every other week subcutaneously to placebo. Both SC-I and SC-II required patients to be &gt;18 years of age with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to ACR criteria who had at least 4 tender and 4 swollen joints at baseline (SC-I) or at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline (SC-II), and an inadequate response to their existing DMARD therapy, where approximately 20% also had a history of inadequate response to at least one TNF inhibitor. All patients in both SC studies received background non-biologic DMARD(s).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In SC-I, 1262 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive tocilizumab-SC 162 mg every week or intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every four weeks in combination with DMARD(s). In SC-II, 656 patients were randomized 2:1 to tocilizumab-SC 162 mg every other week or placebo, in combination with DMARD(s). The primary endpoint in both studies was the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 24.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The clinical response to 24 weeks of tocilizumab-SC therapy is shown in <content styleCode="bold">Table 8</content>. In SC-I, the primary outcome measure was ACR20 at Week 24. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was a treatment difference of 12%. The study demonstrated non-inferiority of tocilizumab with respect to ACR20 at Week 24; ACR50, ACR70, and DAS28 responses are also shown in <content styleCode="bold">Table 8</content>. In SC-II, a greater portion of patients treated with tocilizumab 162 mg subcutaneously every other week achieved ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses compared to placebo-treated patients (Table 8). Further, a greater proportion of patients treated with tocilizumab 162 mg subcutaneously every other week achieved a low level of disease activity as measured by a DAS28-ESR less than 2.6 at Week 24 compared to those treated with placebo (Table 8).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered tocilizumab was assessed in a single, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study in patients with active GCA. In Study WA28119 (NCT01791153), 251 screened patients with new-onset or relapsing GCA were randomized to one of four treatment arms. Two subcutaneous doses of tocilizumab (162 mg every week and 162 mg every other week) were compared to two different placebo control groups (pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen over 26 weeks and 52 weeks) randomized 2:1:1:1. The study consisted of a 52-week blinded period, followed by a 104-week open-label extension.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients received background glucocorticoid (prednisone) therapy. Each of the tocilizumab-treated groups and one of the placebo-treated groups followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 26 weeks, while the second placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified prednisone-taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 52 weeks designed to be more in keeping with standard practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52. Sustained remission was defined by a patient attaining a sustained (1) absence of GCA signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52, (2) normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (to &lt; 30 mm/hr without an elevation to ≥ 30 mm/hr attributable to GCA) from Week 12 through Week 52, (3) normalization of C-reactive protein (CRP) (to &lt; 1 mg/dL, with an absence of successive elevations to ≥ 1mg/dL) from Week 12 through Week 52, and (4) successful adherence to the prednisone taper defined by not more than 100 mg of excess prednisone from Week 12 through Week 52.  Tocilizumab 162 mg weekly and 162 mg every other week + 26 weeks prednisone taper both showed superiority in achieving sustained remission from Week 12 through Week 52 compared with placebo + 26 weeks prednisone taper (Table 9). Both tocilizumab treatment arms also showed superiority compared to the placebo + 52 weeks prednisone taper (Table 9).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of tocilizumab was assessed in a three-part study, WA19977 (NCT00988221), including an open- label extension in children 2 to 17 years of age with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA), who had an inadequate response to methotrexate or inability to tolerate methotrexate. Patients had at least 6 months of active disease (mean disease duration of 4.2 ± 3.7 years), with at least five joints with active arthritis (swollen or limitation of movement accompanied by pain and/or tenderness) and/or at least 3 active joints having limitation of motion (mean, 20 ± 14 active joints). The patients treated had subtypes of JIA that at disease onset included Rheumatoid Factor Positive or Negative Polyarticular JIA, or Extended Oligoarticular JIA. Treatment with a stable dose of methotrexate was permitted but was not required during the study. Concurrent use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), other than methotrexate, or other biologics (e.g., TNF antagonists or T cell costimulation modulator) were not permitted in the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Part I consisted of a 16-week active tocilizumab treatment lead-in period (n=188) followed by Part II, a 24-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled withdrawal period, followed by Part III, a 64-week open-label period. Eligible patients weighing at or above 30 kg received tocilizumab at 8 mg/kg intravenously once every four weeks. Patients weighing less than 30 kg were randomized 1:1 to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intravenously every four weeks. At the conclusion of the open-label Part I, 91% of patients taking background MTX in addition to tocilizumab and 83% of patients on tocilizumab monotherapy achieved an ACR 30 response at week 16 compared to baseline and entered the blinded withdrawal period (Part II) of the study. The proportions of patients with JIA ACR 50/70 responses in Part I were 84.0%, and 64%, respectively for patients taking background MTX in addition to tocilizumab and 80% and 55% respectively for patients on tocilizumab monotherapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Part II, patients (ITT, n=163) were randomized to tocilizumab (same dose received in Part I) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio that was stratified by concurrent methotrexate use and concurrent corticosteroid use. Each patient continued in Part II of the study until Week 40 or until the patient satisfied JIA ACR 30 flare criteria (relative to Week 16) and qualified for escape.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a JIA ACR 30 flare at week 40 relative to week 16. JIA ACR 30 flare was defined as 3 or more of the 6 core outcome variables worsening by at least 30% with no more than 1 of the remaining variables improving by more than 30% relative to Week 16.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tocilizumab treated patients experienced significantly fewer disease flares compared to placebo-treated patients (26% [21/82] versus 48% [39/81]; adjusted difference in proportions -21%, 95% CI: -35%, -8%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the withdrawal phase (Part II), more patients treated with tocilizumab showed JIA ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 40 compared to patients withdrawn to placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Subcutaneously administered tocilizumab in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA) was assessed in WA28117 (NCT01904279), a 52-week, open-label, multicenter, PK-PD and safety study to determine the appropriate subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab that achieved comparable PK/PD profiles to the tocilizumab-IV regimen. PJIA patients aged 1 to 17 years with an inadequate response or inability to tolerate MTX, including patients with well-controlled disease on treatment with tocilizumab-IV and tocilizumab-naïve patients with active disease, were treated with subcutaneous tocilizumab based on body weight.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients weighing at or above 30 kg (n = 25) were treated with 162 mg of tocilizumab-SC every 2 weeks and patients weighing less than 30 kg (n = 27) received 162 mg of tocilizumab-SC every 3 weeks for 52 weeks. Of these 52 patients, 37 (71%) were naive to tocilizumab and 15 (29%) had been receiving tocilizumab-IV and switched to tocilizumab-SC at baseline.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of tocilizumab for the treatment of active SJIA was assessed in WA18221 (NCT00642460), a 12- week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 2-arm study. Patients treated with or without MTX, were randomized (tocilizumab:placebo = 2:1) to one of two treatment groups: 75 patients received tocilizumab infusions every two weeks at either 8 mg per kg for patients at or above 30 kg or 12 mg per kg for patients less than 30 kg and 37 were randomized to receive placebo infusions every two weeks. Corticosteroid tapering could occur from week six for patients who achieved a JIA ACR 70 response. After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab in the open-label extension phase at weight appropriate dosing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with at least 30% improvement in JIA ACR core set (JIA ACR 30 response) at Week 12 and absence of fever (no temperature at or above 37.5°C in the preceding 7 days). JIA ACR (American College of Rheumatology) responses are defined as the percentage improvement (e.g., 30%, 50%, 70%) in 3 of any 6 core outcome variables compared to baseline, with worsening in no more than 1 of the remaining variables by 30% or more. Core outcome variables consist of physician global assessment, parent per patient global assessment, number of joints with active arthritis, number of joints with limitation of movement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and functional ability (childhood health assessment questionnaire-CHAQ).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>RECOVERY was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter platform study conducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients for the tocilizumab portion of the study had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical contraindications to any of the treatments and had clinical evidence of progressive COVID-19 (defined as oxygen saturation &lt;92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, and CRP ≥75 mg/L). Patients were then randomized to receive either standard of care (SoC) or intravenous tocilizumab at a weight-tiered dosing comparable to the recommended dosage <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>] </content>in addition to SoC.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprising 4116 adult patients who were randomized to the tocilizumab + SoC arm (n=2022) or to the SoC arm (n=2094). The mean age of participants was 64 years (range: 20 to 101), and patients were 67% male, 76% White, 11% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% mixed race. At baseline, 0.2% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% of patients required low flow oxygen, 41% of patients required non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, and 14% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation; 82% of patients were reported to be receiving systemic corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was time to death through Day 28. The results for the overall population and the subgroups of patients who were or were not receiving systemic corticosteroids at time of randomization are summarized in Table 11.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>EMPACTA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with SoC in hospitalized, non-ventilated adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age, had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by a positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result, had pneumonia confirmed by radiography, and had SpO2 &lt; 94% on ambient air.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Of the 389 patients randomized, efficacy analyses were performed in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population comprising 377 patients who were randomized and received study medication (249 in the tocilizumab arm; 128 in the placebo arm). The mean age of participants was 56 years (range: 20 to 95); 59% of patients were male, 56% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, 53% were White, 20% were American Indian/Alaska Native, 15% were Black/African American and 2% were Asian. At baseline, 9% patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 64% patients required low flow oxygen, 27% patients required high-flow oxygen, and 73% were on corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint evaluated time to progression to mechanical ventilation or death through Day 28. The hazard ratio comparing tocilizumab to placebo was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.33 to 0.97), a statistically significant result (log-rank, p-value = 0.036). The cumulative proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation or died by Day 28 was 12.0% (95% CI, 8.5% to 16.9%) in the tocilizumab arm and 19.3% (95% CI, 13.3% to 27.4%) in the placebo arm.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Mortality at Day 28 was 10.4% in the tocilizumab arm versus 8.6% in the placebo arm (weighted difference (tocilizumab arm - placebo arm): 2.0% [95% CI, -5.2% to 7.8%]).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>COVACTA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with SoC for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID- 19 pneumonia. The study randomized 452 patients who were at least 18 years of age with confirmed SARS-CoV- 2 infection by a positive RT-PCR result, had pneumonia confirmed by radiography, and had oxygen saturation of 93% or lower on ambient air or a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen of 300 mmHg or less. At baseline, 3% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 28% were on low flow oxygen, 30% were on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, 38% were on invasive mechanical ventilation, and 22% were on corticosteroids. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical status on Day 28 assessed on a 7-category ordinal scale that ranged from "discharged" to "death." There were no statistically significant differences observed in the distributions of clinical status on the 7-category ordinal scale at Day 28 when comparing the tocilizumab arm to the placebo arm.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Mortality at Day 28 was 19.7% in the tocilizumab arm versus 19.4% in the placebo arm (weighted difference (tocilizumab arm - placebo arm): 0.3% [95% CI, -7.6 to 8.2]).</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>A study-level meta-analysis was conducted on EMPACTA, COVACTA, REMDACTA and RECOVERY studies. For each of the four studies, the risk difference through Day 28 was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method in the subgroup of patients receiving baseline corticosteroids, summarized in Figure 2. Patients from the RECOVERY trial represent 78.8% of the total sample size in this meta-analysis. The combined risk difference showed that tocilizumab treatment (n=2261) resulted in a 4.61% absolute reduction in the risk of death at Day 28 (risk difference=-4.6%; 95% CI: -7.3% to -1.9%) compared to SoC (n=2034).</paragraph>
