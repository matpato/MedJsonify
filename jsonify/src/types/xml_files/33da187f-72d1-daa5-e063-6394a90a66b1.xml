 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the controlled trials in patients with RLS, somnolence/sedation was reported in 20% of patients treated with 600 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 6% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated with HORIZANT who reported somnolence, the somnolence persisted during treatment in about 30%. In the remaining patients, symptoms resolved within 3 to 4 weeks. Dizziness was reported in 13% of patients receiving 600 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 4% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated with HORIZANT who reported dizziness, symptoms persisted during treatment in about 20%. Somnolence/sedation led to withdrawal in 2% of patients receiving 600 mg of HORIZANT per day. Dizziness led to withdrawal in 1% of patients receiving 600 mg of HORIZANT per day. The incidence of these adverse reactions was greater in the patients receiving 1,200 mg per day.</paragraph>

Fatigue/asthenia was reported in 6% of patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 1% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day who reported somnolence (10%), the somnolence persisted during treatment in about 27%. In the remaining patients, symptoms resolved within 4 to 5 weeks. Dizziness was reported in 17% of patients receiving 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day compared with 15% of patients receiving placebo. In those patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT per day who reported dizziness, symptoms persisted during treatment in about 6%.

                     <title>5.4 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>HORIZANT (gabapentin enacarbil) is a prodrug of gabapentin, an antiepileptic drug (AED). AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Suicidal behavior and ideation have also been reported in patients after discontinuation of gabapentin
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   <linkHtml href="#L9307bf46-2af8-4883-b7a8-0180219a75bc">5.5</linkHtml>)]
 
  </content>. Because HORIZANT is a prodrug of gabapentin, HORIZANT also increases this risk. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to 1 of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk [adjusted relative risk 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 2.7] of suicidal thinking or behavior compared with patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared with 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately 1 case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Anyone considering prescribing HORIZANT must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that HORIZANT increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Abrupt or rapid discontinuation of gabapentinoids may increase the risk for seizures.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When discontinuing HORIZANT, patients with RLS receiving 600 mg or less once daily can discontinue the drug without tapering. If the recommended dose is exceeded, the dose should be reduced to 600 mg daily for 1 week prior to discontinuation to minimize the potential of withdrawal seizure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with PHN receiving HORIZANT twice daily, the dose should be reduced to once daily for 1 week prior to discontinuation to minimize the potential of withdrawal seizure, see Table 2

                        <paragraph>There is evidence from case reports, human studies, and animal studies associating gabapentin with serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression when co-administered with central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including opioids, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. When the decision is made to co-prescribe HORIZANT with another CNS depressant, particularly an opioid, or to prescribe HORIZANT to patients with underlying respiratory impairment, monitor patients for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and consider initiating HORIZANT at a low dose. The management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and reduction or withdrawal of CNS depressants (including HORIZANT).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. HORIZANT is a prodrug of gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. HORIZANT should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</paragraph>

Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence reported in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment.

HORIZANT in the treatment of RLS was studied primarily in placebo-controlled trials (n = 642), and in long- term follow-up studies. The population with RLS ranged from 18 to 82 years of age, with 60% being female and 95% being Caucasian.</paragraph>

Overall, the mean age of patients in the PHN studies ranged from 61 to 64 years of age across dose groups; the majority of patients were male (45% to 61%) and Caucasian (80% to 98%).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The safety of HORIZANT in doses ranging from 1,200 to 3,600 mg has been evaluated in 417 patients with PHN in 3 clinical studies. The principal efficacy study evaluating the efficacy and safety of HORIZANT in the management of PHN was a 12-week, double-blind, multicenter study comparing 1,200 mg/day, 2,400 mg/day and 3,600 mg/day to placebo. Six out of 107 (6%) patients treated with 1,200 mg of HORIZANT discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with 12 of the 95 (13%) patients who received placebo.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of HORIZANT in pregnant women. In nonclinical studies in rats and rabbits, administration of gabapentin enacarbil was developmentally toxic when administered to pregnant animals at doses and gabapentin exposures greater than those used clinically

  </content>.

 </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Postmarketing data suggest that extended gabapentin use with opioids close to delivery may increase the risk of neonatal withdrawal versus opioids alone. Although there is at least one report of neonatal withdrawal syndrome in an infant exposed to gabapentin alone during pregnancy, there are no comparative epidemiologic studies evaluating this association. Therefore, whether exposure to gabapentin alone late in pregnancy may cause withdrawal signs and symptoms is not known [see

                              <paragraph>In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Neonatal withdrawal syndrome has been reported in newborns exposed to gabapentin in utero for an extended period of time when also exposed to opioids close to delivery. Neonatal withdrawal signs and symptoms reported have included tachypnea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertonia, irritability, sneezing, poor feeding, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, and tremor. Reported signs and symptoms that may also be related to withdrawal include tongue thrusting, wandering eye movements while awake, back arching, and continuous extremity movements. Observe neonates exposed to HORIZANT and opioids for signs and symptoms of neonatal withdrawal and manage accordingly.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>When pregnant rats were administered gabapentin enacarbil (oral doses of 200, 1,000, or 5,000 mg/kg/day) throughout the period of organogenesis, embryofetal mortality was increased at the 2 highest doses and fetal body weights were decreased at the high dose. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats (200 mg/kg/day) represents approximately 2 times the gabapentin exposure associated with the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1,200 mg/day gabapentin enacarbil on an area under the curve (AUC) basis.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>When pregnant rabbits were administered gabapentin enacarbil (oral doses of 200, 500, or 2,500 mg/kg/day) throughout the period of organogenesis, embryofetal mortality was increased and fetal body weights were decreased at the high dose. The no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbits (500 mg/kg/day) represents approximately 9 times the gabapentin exposure associated with the MRHD of 1,200 mg/day gabapentin enacarbil on an AUC basis.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>When female rats were administered gabapentin enacarbil (oral doses of 200, 1,000, or 5,000 mg/kg/day) throughout the pregnancy and lactation periods, offspring growth and survival were decreased at the two highest doses. The no-effect dose for pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity in rats is approximately 2 times the MRHD on an AUC basis.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In reproductive and developmental studies of gabapentin, developmental toxicity was observed at all doses tested. Increased incidences of hydroureter and/or hydronephrosis were observed in rat offspring following treatment of pregnant animals in studies of fertility and general reproductive performance, embryofetal development, and peri- and post-natal development. Overall, a no-effect dose was not established. In mice, treatment of pregnant animals with gabapentin during the period of organogenesis resulted in delayed fetal skeletal ossification at all but the lowest dose tested. When pregnant rabbits were treated with gabapentin during the period of organogenesis, an increase in embryofetal mortality was observed at all doses of gabapentin tested.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In a published study, gabapentin (400 mg/kg/day) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to neonatal mice during the first postnatal week, a period of synaptogenesis in rodents (corresponding to the last trimester of pregnancy in humans). Gabapentin caused a marked decrease in neuronal synapse formation in brains of intact mice and abnormal neuronal synapse formation in a mouse model of synaptic repair. Gabapentin has been shown
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>to interfere with activity of the Î±2Î´ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels, a receptor involved in neuronal synaptogenesis. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

There are no data on the effects of gabapentin on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for HORIZANT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from HORIZANT or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Of the 515 patients treated with HORIZANT in the 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trials for RLS, 11% were 65 to 74 years of age and 1% were 75 years of age and older. Clinical trials of HORIZANT for the treatment of RLS did not include a sufficient number of patients 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger individuals.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of HORIZANT for the management of PHN (n = 276 patients treated with HORIZANT), 37% were 65 to 74 years of age and 13% were 75 years of age and older. The overall incidence of adverse events was comparable between the patients aged â¥18 to &lt;65 years and â¥65 to &lt;74 years. No overall differences in the safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Gabapentin is known to be almost exclusively excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, the frequency of dosing may need to be adjusted based on calculated creatinine clearance in these patients

                        <paragraph>Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Gabapentin does not exhibit affinity for benzodiazepine, opioid (mu, delta, or kappa), or cannabinoid 1 receptor sites. A small number of postmarketing cases report gabapentin misuse and abuse. These individuals were taking higher than recommended doses of gabapentin for unapproved uses. Most of the individuals described in these reports had a history of poly- substance abuse or used gabapentin to relieve symptoms of withdrawal from other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When prescribing products that deliver gabapentin, carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and observe them for signs and symptoms of gabapentin misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, self-dose escalation, and drug-seeking behavior).</paragraph>

After discontinuation of short-term and long-term treatment with gabapentin, withdrawal symptoms have been observed in some patients. Withdrawal symptoms may occur shortly after discontinuation, usually within 48 hours. In the postmarketing setting, reported adverse reactions have included, but not been limited to, seizures, depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, agitation, confusion, disorientation, psychotic symptoms, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, pain, sweating, tremor, headache, dizziness, and malaise. The dependence and abuse potential of gabapentin has not been evaluated in human studies.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Gabapentin enacarbil is a prodrug of gabapentin and, accordingly, its therapeutic effects in RLS and PHN are attributable to gabapentin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism by which gabapentin is efficacious in RLS and PHN is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action by which gabapentin is efficacious in PHN is unknown but in animal models of analgesia, gabapentin prevents allodynia (pain-related behavior in response to a normally innocuous stimulus) and hyperalgesia (exaggerated response to painful stimuli). Gabapentin prevents pain-related responses in several models of neuropathic pain in rats and mice (e.g., spinal nerve ligation models, spinal cord injury model, acute herpes zoster infection model). Gabapentin also decreases pain-related responses after peripheral inflammation (carrageenan footpad test, late phase of formalin test), but does not alter immediate pain-related behaviors (rat tail flick test, formalin footpad acute phase). The relevance of these models to human pain is not known.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but has no effect on GABA binding, uptake, or degradation. Gabapentin enacarbil and gabapentin have been tested in radioligand binding assays, and neither exhibited affinity for a number of other common receptor, ion channel, or transporter proteins.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>studies have shown that gabapentin binds with high affinity to the Î±2Î´ subunit of voltage-activated calcium channels; however, the relationship of this binding to the therapeutic effects of gabapentin enacarbil in RLS and PHN is unknown.

                        <paragraph>HORIZANT is an extended-release formulation of gabapentin enacarbil, a prodrug of gabapentin. HORIZANT provides approximately dose-proportional and extended exposure to gabapentin over the range 300 to 6,000 mg. HORIZANT and gabapentin are notÂ substitutable because the same daily dose of each results in different plasma concentrations of gabapentin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For subjects with PHN taking HORIZANT 600 mg twice daily, the estimated steady state mean C
 
  <sub>max</sub>was 5.35 Âµg/mL, mean AUC
 
  <sub>24</sub>was approximately 109 Âµg*hr/mL, mean C

                              <paragraph>The pathway for absorption of gabapentin enacarbil is believed to include active transport via a proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter, MCT-1. This transporter is expressed at high levels in the intestinal tract and is not saturated by administration of high doses of HORIZANT. Mean bioavailability of gabapentin (based on urinary recovery of gabapentin) for HORIZANT in the fed state is about 75%. Bioavailability under fasting conditions has been estimated by gabapentin urinary recovery to be 42% to 65%. In a food effect study, the exposure of gabapentin increased by 24%, 34%, and 44% with low, moderate, and high fat meals, respectively. The T
 
  <sub>max</sub>of gabapentin after administration of 600 mg of HORIZANT was 5.0 hours in fasted subjects and 7.3 hours in fed subjects. Steady state is reached in 2 days with daily administration.

                              <paragraph>After oral administration, gabapentin enacarbil undergoes extensive first-pass hydrolysis by non-specific carboxylesterases primarily in enterocytes and to a lesser extent in the liver, to form gabapentin, carbon dioxide, acetaldehyde, and isobutyric acid. Levels of gabapentin enacarbil in blood are low and transient (â¤2% of corresponding gabapentin plasma levels). Released gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans. Neither gabapentin enacarbil nor gabapentin are substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of the major cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). Gabapentin enacarbil is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein

                              <paragraph>Following hydrolysis of gabapentin enacarbil, the released gabapentin is excreted unchanged by the kidney. Gabapentin renal excretion is believed to involve a component of active secretion via an organic cation transporter (OCT2) present in the kidney. In a human pharmacokinetic study with immediate release
 
  <sup>14</sup>C gabapentin enacarbil, mean recovery of total radioactivity in urine was 94%, with 5% of the radioactive dose recovered in feces.

                              <paragraph>Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of gabapentin from plasma after dosing of HORIZANT with food ranged from 6.0 to 9.3 L/hr. Following oral dosing of HORIZANT, plasma clearance of gabapentin is approximately proportional to creatinine clearance. Renal clearance (CLr) of gabapentin ranged from 5 to 7 L/hr, regardless of food intake or food type. The elimination half-life (t
 
  <sub>Â½</sub>) of gabapentin ranges from 5.1 to 6.0 hours and is unaltered by dose or following multiple doses of HORIZANT.

Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) decreased in moderate (4.2 L/hr) and severe renal impairment patients (1.7 L/hr) compared with 6.0 to 9.3 L/hr in patients without renal impairment. Similarly, CLr was decreased to 3 and 1 L/hr in moderate and severe renal impairment patients, respectively, compared with 5 to 7 L/hr in non-renal impairment patients. Dosage reduction in patients with renal dysfunction not on dialysis is necessary.

                                    <paragraph>Gabapentin is effectively removed from plasma by hemodialysis. The mean percentage of gabapentin recovered following hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease was 29% (expressed as a proportion of the gabapentin released from HORIZANT). For patients with PHN on hemodialysis, dosage reduction is required

  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>study showed that about 63% of the total gabapentin enacarbil dose was released at 1 hour at the highest alcohol level (40%), and about 43% of total drug was released at 1 hour with 5% alcohol. Ethanol causes a more rapid release of gabapentin enacarbil from the extended-release tablets that may increase the risk for adverse events associated with HORIZANT. Consumption of alcohol is not recommended when taking HORIZANT.

                     <title>14.1 Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) 12-Week Pivotal Studies</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of HORIZANT in the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary RLS was demonstrated in two 12-week clinical studies in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Key diagnostic criteria for RLS are: an urge to move the legs usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant leg sensations, symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting, symptoms are partially or totally relieved by movement such as walking or stretching at least as long as the activity continues, and symptoms are worse or occur only in the evening or night. Patients were required to have a total score of â¥15 on the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, iron deficiency anemia) were excluded. In study 1, patients were randomized to receive 1,200 mg of HORIZANT (N = 112) or placebo (N = 108) taken once daily at about 5 PM with food. In study 2, patients were randomized to receive 600 mg of HORIZANT (N = 114), 1,200 mg of HORIZANT (N = 111), or placebo (N = 96) taken once daily at about 5 PM with food.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy was evaluated using the IRLS Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS Rating Scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence/sedation, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. The CGI-I Scale allows the investigator to rate the patient's overall change in RLS symptoms since baseline, whether or not in the opinion of the investigator the change is related to study drug treatment. The change from baseline in the IRLS Rating Scale at Week 12 and the proportion of responders on the CGI-I Scale defined as a rating of "much improved" or "very much improved" at Week 12 were co-primary outcomes in these studies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these 2 studies, the mean age of patients studied was 50 years (range: 18 to 81 years); 59% of the patients were female. The racial distribution for these studies was as follows: Caucasian, 95%; black, 2%; and other, 3%.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Statistically significant differences (
 
  <content styleCode="italics">P</content>&lt;0.05) between the treatment groups receiving 600 and 1,200 mg of HORIZANT and the group receiving placebo were observed at Week 12 for both the mean change from baseline in the IRLS Scale total score and the proportion of responders ("much improved" or "very much improved") on the CGI-I Scale as described in Table 6.

                     <title>14.2 Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN) 12-Week Study</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of HORIZANT for the management of postherpetic neuralgia was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 12- week study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and dose response of 3 maintenance doses of HORIZANT (1,200, 2,400, and 3,600 mg/day, with 107, 82, and 87 patients in each dosing group, respectively). Patients greater than 18 years of age with a documented medical diagnosis of PHN of at least three months duration were enrolled. To ensure that patients had significant pain, randomized patients were required to have a minimum baseline 24-hour average Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) intensity score of at least 4.0 on the 11-point numerical PI-NRS, ranging from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("pain as bad as you can imagine"). In this study, a total of 276 patients received HORIZANT while 95 patients received placebo. Following a 1-week baseline period during which patients were screened for eligibility, patients began a 1-week up-titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance treatment period, and then a 1-week down-titration period. Treatment with HORIZANT statistically significantly improved the mean pain score and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain score from baseline at all doses tested. A benefit over placebo was observed for all 3 doses of HORIZANT as early as Week 1 and maintained to the end of treatment. Additional benefit of using doses of greater than 1,200 mg a day was not demonstrated. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to end of maintenance treatment, Figure 2 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement. The figure is cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.3 Effects on Driving</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Driving performance was assessed in a three way crossover study in healthy volunteers (mean age 36 years). Subjects were dosed at approximately 5 pm with HORIZANT 600 mg (for five days), diphenhydramine 50 mg (1 dose), and placebo (for five days). After the last dose, driving was evaluated on a computer-based simulation for 1 hour in the evening approximately 2 to 4 hours after dosing (7 to 9 pm), in the morning after dosing (7 to 9 am), and at midday the day after dosing (11 am to 1 pm). The primary endpoint of the study was lane position variability. There was no difference in change from baseline in lane position variability for HORIZANT compared to placebo at any of the simulated driving timepoints. Secondary measures included speed variability and the occurrence of simulated crashes. Subjects in this study experienced simulated crashes as described in Table 7. At the times that simulated crashes occurred, there was an increase in average speed variability in the HORIZANT- and diphenhydramine-treated groups that was most notable in patients who experienced simulated crashes, but no increases in lane position variability. Later time points post-dosing or the effects of driving after more than five days of dosing with HORIZANT were not evaluated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The results of a separate 2-week driving simulation study in patients (mean age 47 years) with moderate-to-severe primary RLS showed that once daily doses of 1,200 mg and 1,800 mg of HORIZANT significantly impaired simulated driving performance based on lane position variability. An increased number of simulated crashes were reported in patients tested near T
 
  <sub>max</sub>after receiving 1,200 mg or 1,800 mg of HORIZANT compared to patients treated with diphenhydramine 50 mg. In addition, patients receiving 1,200 mg of HORIZANT experienced an increased number of simulated crashes at 14 to 16 hours after dosing compared with placebo, diphenhydramine, and 1,800 mg of HORIZANT.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The design limitations of these two studies do not permit inference regarding dose response relationship or the duration of the effect HORIZANT has on driving in patients with RLS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The results of a separate driving simulation study comparing untreated RLS patients and healthy subjects showed no difference in lane position variability but an increase in speed variability associated with a greater number of simulated crashes in RLS patients relative to healthy subjects, which may indicate impaired driving in RLS patients in the absence of medication.</paragraph>
