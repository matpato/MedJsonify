 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>a.              Place the specified amount of water into a polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) or glass bottle (see Table 4). Constitution in other bottle types is not recommended because there is no stability data with other bottle types.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>b.              Carefully separate the capsule body and cap and pour the contents of the required number of oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg capsules into the PET or glass bottle.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>c.              Gently swirl the suspension to ensure adequate wetting of the oseltamivir phosphate powder for at least 2 minutes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>d.              Slowly add the specified amount of vehicle to the bottle.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>e.              Close the bottle using a child-resistant cap and shake well for 30 seconds to completely dissolve the active drug and to ensure homogeneous distribution of the dissolved drug in the resulting suspension. The active drug, oseltamivir phosphate, readily dissolves in the specified vehicles. The suspension is caused by inert ingredients of oseltamivir phosphate capsules which are insoluble in these vehicles.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>f.               Put an ancillary label on the bottle indicating "Shake Well Before Use."</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>g.              Instruct the parent or caregiver that any unused suspension remaining in the bottle following completion of therapy must be discarded by either affixing an ancillary label to the bottle or adding a statement to the pharmacy label instructions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>h.              Place a pharmacy label on the bottle that includes the patient's name, dosing instructions, drug name and any other required information to be in compliance with all State and Federal Pharmacy Regulations. Place an appropriate expiration date on the label according to storage conditions below.</paragraph>

  </content>. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir phosphate usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of oseltamivir phosphate to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. Closely monitor oseltamivir phosphate-treated patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing oseltamivir phosphate for each patient.

Available published epidemiological data suggest that oseltamivir phosphate, taken in any trimester, is not associated with an increased risk of birth defects. However, these studies individually are limited by small sample sizes, use of different comparison groups, and some lacked information on dose, which preclude a definitive assessment of the risk

In rats, embryo‐fetal effects consisting of an increased incidence of minor skeletal malformations were observed at a maternaly toxic dose (1500 mg/kg/day), resulting in systemic drug exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) 190 times human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice a day). In the rabbit study, embryo‐fetal effects consisting of an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities and variants were observed at maternally toxic doses (≥150 mg/kg/day) resulting in systemic exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) ≥8 times human exposures at the MRHD of oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>

Prolonged parturition duration and reduced offspring viability were observed at a maternally toxic dose (1500 mg/kg/day). No adverse maternal or offspring effects were observed at doses ≤500 mg/kg/day, resulting in systemic drug exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) 44 times human exposures at the MRHD of oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for oseltamivir phosphate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID119">In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, the peak concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate following a single 30 mg dose of oseltamivir or once weekly oseltamivir was approximately 3-fold higher than in patients with normal renal function who received 75 mg twice daily. The plasma concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate on Day 5 (147 ng/mL) following a single 30 mg dose in CAPD patients is similar to the predicted C
 
  <sub>min</sub>(160 ng/mL) in patients with normal renal function following 75 mg twice daily. Administration of 30 mg once weekly to CAPD patients resulted in plasma concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate at the 168-hour blood sample of 63 ng/mL, which were comparable to the C
 
  <sub>min</sub>in patients with normal renal function receiving the approved regimen of 75 mg once daily (40 ng/mL).

                        <paragraph>A pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the oseltamivir phosphate dosage regimen resulted in lower exposure to the active metabolite in pregnant women (n=59) compared to non-pregnant women (n=33). However, this predicted exposure is expected to have activity against susceptible influenza virus strains and there are insufficient pharmacokinetics and safety data to recommend a dose adjustment for pregnant women

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been evaluated in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in pediatric subjects aged 5 to 16 years (n=18) and in a small number of pediatric subjects aged 3 to 12 years (n=5) enrolled in a clinical trial. Younger pediatric subjects cleared both the prodrug and the active metabolite faster than adult subjects resulting in a lower exposure for a given mg/kg dose. For oseltamivir carboxylate, apparent total clearance decreases linearly with increasing age (up to 12 years). The pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir in pediatric subjects over 12 years of age are similar to those in adult subjects

Half-lives observed in the geriatric subjects were similar to those seen in young adults. Based on drug exposure and tolerability, dose adjustments are not required for geriatric patients for either treatment or prophylaxis

                        <paragraph>Oseltamivir is extensively converted to oseltamivir carboxylate by esterases, located predominantly in the liver. Drug interactions involving competition for esterases have not been extensively reported in literature. Low protein binding of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate suggests that the probability of drug displacement interactions is low.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies demonstrate that neither oseltamivir nor oseltamivir carboxylate is a good substrate for P450 mixed-function oxidases or for glucuronyl transferases.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Coadministration of probenecid results in an approximate two-fold increase in exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate due to a decrease in active anionic tubular secretion in the kidney. However, due to the safety margin of oseltamivir carboxylate, no dose adjustments are required when coadministering with probenecid.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed when coadministering oseltamivir with amoxicillin, acetaminophen, aspirin, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminum hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine, amantadine, or warfarin.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oseltamivir phosphate is an ethyl ester prodrug requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase affecting release of viral particles. The median IC
 
  <sub>50</sub>values of oseltamivir against influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, and influenza B clinical isolates were 2.5 nM (range 0.93 to 4.16 nM, N=74), 0.96 nM (range 0.13 to 7.95 nM, N=774), and 60 nM (20 to 285 nM, N=256), respectively, in a neuraminidase assay with a fluorescently labeled MUNANA substrate.

                        <paragraph>The antiviral activity of oseltamivir carboxylate against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza virus was determined in cell culture. The concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate required for inhibition of influenza virus in cell culture were highly variable depending on the assay method used and the virus tested. The 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC
 
  <sub>50</sub>and EC
 
  <sub>90</sub>) were in the range of 0.0008 micromolar to greater than 35 micromolar and 0.004 micromolar to greater than 100 micromolar, respectively (1 micromolar=0.284 microgram per mL). The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture, inhibitory activity in the neuraminidase assay, and the inhibition of influenza virus replication in humans has not been established.

                        <paragraph>Influenza A virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate have been recovered by serial passage of virus in cell culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate. Reduced susceptibility of influenza virus to inhibition by oseltamivir carboxylate may be conferred by amino acid substitutions in the viral neuraminidase and/or hemagglutinin proteins.</paragraph>

Changes in the viral neuraminidase that have been associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate are summarized in Table 8. The clinical impact of this reduced susceptibility is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hemagglutinin (HA) substitutions selected in cell culture and associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir include (influenza virus subtype-specific numbering) A11T, K173E, and R453M in H3N2; and H99Q in influenza B virus (Yamagata lineage). In some cases, HA substitutions were selected in conjunction with known NA resistance substitutions and may contribute to reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir; however, the impact of HA substitutions on antiviral activity of oseltamivir in humans is unknown and likely to be strain-dependent.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID124">Selection of influenza A viruses resistant to oseltamivir can occur at higher frequencies in children. Oseltamivir treatment-associated resistance in pediatric treatment studies has been detected at frequencies of 27 to 37% and 3 to 18% (3/11 to 7/19 and 1/34 to 9/50 post-treatment isolates, respectively) for influenza A/H1N1 virus and influenza A/H3N2 virus, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The frequency of resistance selection to oseltamivir and the prevalence of such resistant virus vary seasonally and geographically.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Circulating seasonal influenza strains expressing neuraminidase resistance-associated substitutions have been observed in individuals who have not received oseltamivir treatment. The oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution H275Y was found in more than 99% of US-circulating 2008 H1N1 influenza virus isolates. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus ("swine flu") was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir; however, the frequency of circulating resistant variants can change from season to season. Prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cross-resistance between oseltamivir and zanamivir has been observed in neuraminidase biochemical assays. The H275Y (N1 numbering) or N294S (N2 numbering) oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in the N1 neuraminidase subtype, and the E119V or N294S oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in the N2 subtype (N2 numbering), are associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir but not zanamivir. The Q136K and K150T zanamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in N1 neuraminidase, or the S250G zanamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in influenza B virus neuraminidase, confer reduced susceptibility to zanamivir but not oseltamivir. The R292K oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution observed in N2, and the I222T, D198E/N, R371K, or G402S oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in influenza B virus neuraminidase, confer reduced susceptibility to both oseltamivir and zanamivir. These examples do not represent an exhaustive list of cross resistance-associated substitutions and prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No single amino acid substitution has been identified that could confer cross-resistance between the neuraminidase inhibitor class (oseltamivir, zanamivir) and the M2 ion channel inhibitor class (amantadine, rimantadine). However, a virus may carry a neuraminidase inhibitor-associated substitution in neuraminidase and an M2 ion channel inhibitor associated substitution in M2 and may therefore be resistant to both classes of inhibitors. The clinical relevance of phenotypic cross-resistance evaluations has not been established.</paragraph>

The mean maximum daily exposures to the prodrug in mice and rats were approximately 130- and 320-fold, respectively, greater than those in humans at the recommended clinical dose based on AUC comparisons.

It was found to be positive in a Syrian Hamster Embryo (SHE) cell transformation test. Oseltamivir carboxylate was non-mutagenic in the Ames test and the L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay with and without enzymatic activation and negative in the SHE cell transformation test.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, doses of oseltamivir at 50, 250, and 1500 mg/kg/day were administered to females for 2 weeks before mating, during mating and until day 6 of pregnancy. Males were dosed for 4 weeks before mating, during mating, and for 2 weeks after mating. There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development at any dose level. The highest dose in this study was approximately 115 times the human systemic exposure (AUC
 
  <sub>0-24h</sub>) of oseltamivir carboxylate that occurs after administration of the maximum recommended human dose.

                        <paragraph>Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as "none," "mild," "moderate," or "severe". Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as "none" or "mild". In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.</paragraph>

Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo.

Median time since transplant for solid organ transplant recipients was 1,105 days for the placebo group and 1,379 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Median time since transplant for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 424 days for the placebo group and 367 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Approximately 40% of subjects received influenza vaccine prior to entering the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of confirmed clinical influenza, defined as oral temperature higher than 99.0 F (37.2 C) plus cough and/or coryza, all recorded within 24 hours, plus either a positive virus culture or a four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline. Subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg or placebo once daily by mouth for 12 weeks. The incidence of confirmed clinical influenza was 3% (7/238) in the placebo group compared with 2% (5/237) in the oseltamivir phosphate group; this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis was performed using the same clinical symptoms and RT-PCR for laboratory confirmation of influenza infection. Among subjects who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed clinical influenza infection was 3% (7/231) in the placebo group and &lt;1% (1/232) in the oseltamivir phosphate group.</paragraph>
