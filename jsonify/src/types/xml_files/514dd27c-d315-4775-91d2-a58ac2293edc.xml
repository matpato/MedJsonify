                        <paragraph>No specific investigation of the absolute bioavailability of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets in humans has been conducted. However, literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability about 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is between 38% and 48%.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A summary of the single dose and multiple dose levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetic parameters for 18 women under fasting conditions is provided in Table 1. The plasma concentrations of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol reached steady-state by approximately day 14. Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol concentrations did not increase from days 14 to 28, but did increase from days 1 to 28.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Distribution</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Levonorgestrel in serum is primarily bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Ethinyl estradiol is about 97% bound to serum albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metabolism</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Levonorgestrel: The most important metabolic pathways are reduction of the Δ4-3-oxo group and hydroxylation at positions 2α, 1β, and 16β, followed by conjugation. Most of the circulating metabolites are sulfates of 3α, 5β-tetrahydro-levonorgestrel, while excretion occurs predominantly in the form of glucuronides. Some of the parent levonorgestrel also circulates as 17β-sulfate. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ethinyl estradiol: Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4) in the liver are responsible for the 2-hydroxylation that is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation, sulfation, and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of ethinyl estradiol 2-hydroxylation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Excretion</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The terminal elimination half-life for levonorgestrel in levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets is about 36 hours. Levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine (40% to 68%) and in feces (16% to 48%). The terminal elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol in levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets is about 21 hours.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ethinyl estradiol is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic recirculation.</paragraph>

Among such populations, about 89% become pregnant within one year.

The FDA has declared the following dosage regimens of oral contraceptives to be safe and effective for emergency contraception: for tablets containing 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 500 mcg of norgestrel 1 dose is 2 tablets; for tablets containing 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 100 mcg of levonorgestrel 1 dose is 5 tablets; for tablets containing 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg of levonorgestrel 1 dose is 4 tablets.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph ID="ID163">The efficacy and safety of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets were studied in 2 one-year clinical trials of subjects age 18 to 49. There were no exclusions for body mass index (BMI), weight, or bleeding history.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The primary efficacy and safety study (313-NA) was a one-year open-label clinical trial that treated 2,134 subjects in North America. Of these subjects 1,213 (56.8%) discontinued prematurely, including 102 (4.8%) discontinued by the Sponsor for early study closure. The mean weight of subjects in this study was 70.38 kg. The efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets was assessed by the number of pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 14 days of the last dose. Among subjects 35 years or less, there were 23 pregnancies (4 of these occurred during the interval 1 to 14 days after the last day of pill use) during 12,572 28-day pill packs of use. The resulting total Pearl Index was 2.38 (95% CI: 1.51, 3.57) and the one-year life table pregnancy rate was 2.39 (95% CI: 1.57, 3.62). Pill pack cycles during which subjects used back-up contraception or were not sexually active were not included in these calculations. Among women 35 years or less who took the pills completely as directed, there were 15 pregnancies (method failures) resulting in a Pearl Index of 1.55 (95% CI: 0.87, 2.56) and the one-year life table pregnancy rate was 1.59 (95% CI: 0.95 to 2.67).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a second supportive study conducted in Europe (315-EU), 641 subjects were randomized to levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets (n=323) or the cyclic comparator of 100 mcg levonorgestrel and 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol (n=318). The mean weight of subjects in this study was 63.86 kg. The efficacy analysis among women 35 years or less included 2,756 levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablet pill packs and 2,886 cyclic comparator pill packs. There was one pregnancy in the levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol group that occurred within 14 days following the last dose. There were three pregnancies in the cyclic comparator group.</paragraph>

The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population.

This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary-artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes.

                        <paragraph ID="ID178">Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age, and obesity. In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism. Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see section <content styleCode="bold">

                           </content>). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>b. Venous Thrombosis and Thromboembolism</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An increased risk of venous thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established. The risk of venous thrombotic and thromboembolic events is further increased in women with conditions predisposing for venous thrombosis and thromboembolism. Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease. Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization. The approximate incidence of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in users of low dose (&lt;0.05 mg ethinyl estradiol) combination oral contraceptives is up to 4 per 10,000 woman-years compared to 0.5 to 3 per 10,000 woman-years for non-users. However, the incidence is less than that associated with pregnancy (6 per 10,000 woman-years). The excess risk is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. Venous thromboembolism may be fatal. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and gradually disappears after pill use is stopped.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A post-marketing observational study evaluated the risk of venous thromboembolism with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets use in two large US automated healthcare claims databases. The study was not completed as planned due to low accrual of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets users in these databases and discontinuation of the product from the market due to low usage. At study discontinuation, the crude incidence rate of venous thromboembolism among levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets users (n=12,281) was 17.6 per 10,000 person- years, compared to 8.8 per 10,000 person-years among the users of cyclic oral contraceptives containing 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and a progestogen, and 5.1 per 10,000 person-years among the users of cyclic oral contraceptives containing the progestin levonorgestrel and 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Adjustment for important risk factors or confounders (such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and other diseases) for venous thromboembolism could not be performed due to the small sample size. Although the study results suggest an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism with current levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets use compared to cyclic oral hormonal contraceptive use, reliable interpretation of the results is significantly limited due to the small sample size and concerns over unmeasured and uncontrolled confounding, as well as questions about the suitability of the comparator selection and the validity of the venous thromboembolism definition.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A two-to-four fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions. If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate post-partum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breast-feed, or after a midtrimester pregnancy termination.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>c. Cerebrovascular Diseases</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (&gt;35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes. Transient ischemic attacks have also been associated with oral contraceptive use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Women with migraine (particularly migraine/headaches with focal neurological symptoms such as aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke.

                        <paragraph>d. Dose-Related Risk of Vascular Disease From Oral Contraceptives</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>e. Persistence of Risk of Vascular Disease</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persisted for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small. However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 0.05 mg or higher of estrogens.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table 3). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is less than that associated with childbirth. The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's — but not reported until 1983. However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of these changes in practice, and also because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy nonsmoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy nonsmoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (&lt;6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [see Postmarketing Experience].</paragraph>

However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.</paragraph>

Endometrial malignancy is rare in this age group, so change in the risk is unlikely to be detected with a study of this size.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Combination oral contraceptives may worsen existing gallbladder disease and may accelerate the development of this disease in previously asymptomatic women. Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens. More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal. The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users. Oral contraceptives containing greater than 0.075 mg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance. Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents. However, in the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose. Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID216">Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Coadministration of Other Products: Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or unscheduled bleeding. Examples include rifampin, rifabutin, barbiturates, primidone, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin, and modafinil. In such cases a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control should be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Several cases of contraceptive failure and unscheduled bleeding have been reported in the literature with concomitant administration of antibiotics such as ampicillin and other penicillins, and tetracyclines. However, clinical pharmacology studies investigating drug interactions between combined oral contraceptives and these antibiotics have reported inconsistent results. Enterohepatic recirculation of estrogens may also be decreased by substances that reduce gut transit time.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with coadministration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Health care professionals should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increases AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen increase the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol since these drugs act as competitive inhibitors for sulfation of ethinyl estradiol in the gastrointestinal wall, a known pathway of elimination for ethinyl estradiol. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and troleandomycin may increase plasma hormone levels. Troleandomycin may also increase the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis during coadministration with combination oral contraceptives.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (eg, ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, prednisolone and other corticosteroids, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and lamotrigine, and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation (particularly glucuronidation), have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The prescribing information of concomitant medications should be consulted to identify potential interactions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID218">Certain endocrine- and liver-function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>a. Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>b. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T<sub>4</sub> by column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T<sub>3</sub> resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T<sub>4</sub> concentration is unaltered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>c. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum ie, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulins (SHBG) leading to increased levels of total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free or biologically active hormone concentrations are unchanged.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>d. Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>e.  Glucose tolerance may be decreased.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>f. Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.</paragraph>

In addition, combination oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use combination oral contraceptives, but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.</paragraph>

This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her health care professional. The possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled green tablets are missed. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered. Hormonal contraception must be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph ID="ID245">
                     <content styleCode="bold">This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis. </content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Oral contraceptives, also known as "birth-control pills" or "the pill," are taken to prevent pregnancy, and when taken correctly, have a failure rate of approximately 1 to 2% per year (1 to 2 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when used without missing any pills. The average failure rate of large numbers of pill users is approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when women who miss pills are included. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>DOLISHALE is a birth-control pill that is taken every day. When you take DOLISHALE, the lining of your uterus does not undergo the changes needed for menstruation, and therefore you do not have regular menstrual periods. You are likely to have unscheduled or unplanned bleeding or spotting when you start to use DOLISHALE. The number of days each month with unscheduled bleeding and spotting usually decreases over time for the majority of women. When using DOLISHALE , the convenience of having no regular menstrual periods should be weighed against the inconvenience of unscheduled or unplanned breakthrough bleeding and spotting.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. However, there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be life-threatening or may cause temporary or permanent disability or death. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• smoke</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or a tendency to form blood clots, or are obese</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice, malignant or benign liver tumors, or major surgery with prolonged immobilization</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• have headaches with neurological symptoms</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use in healthy, non-smoking women over 40 (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women.</paragraph>

This risk increases with age and with the amount of smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day has been associated with a significantly increased risk) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should not smoke.</content>

                        <paragraph ID="ID249">Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common such effects are nausea, vomiting, unscheduled bleeding, weight gain, breast tenderness, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and do not smoke. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>1. Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack and angina pectoris) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and subsequent serious medical consequences. Women with migraine also may be at increased risk of stroke with pill use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>2. Liver tumors, which may rupture and cause severe bleeding. A possible, but not definite, association has been found with the pill and liver cancer. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>3. High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your health care provider if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, as well as some anticonvulsants and some antibiotics, herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), and HIV/AIDS drugs may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There may be slight increases in the risk of breast cancer among current users of hormonal birth control pills with longer duration of use of 8 years or more.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Taking the pill provides some important noncontraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, fewer pelvic infections, and fewer cancers of the ovary and the lining of the uterus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your health care provider. Your health care provider will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it, and the health care provider believes that it is appropriate to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information leaflet gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your health care provider.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="bold">What You Should Know About Your Menstrual Cycle When You Use DOLISHALE </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>You are likely to have unscheduled or unplanned bleeding or spotting when you start to use DOLISHALE. The number of days each month with bleeding or spotting usually decreases over time in the majority of women. In a study of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol, about 5 out of 10 women had 7 or more days of bleeding or spotting while using their third 28-day pill pack of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets. The number of women with 7 or more days of bleeding or spotting decreased to 3 out of 10 women during the use of their seventh pill pack. Among women who continued to use levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets for one year, about 6 out of 10 women had no bleeding or spotting during their last month of use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Do not stop taking DOLISHALE because of bleeding or spotting as this will increase your chance of getting pregnant. If the spotting or bleeding continues for more than 7 consecutive days or if the bleeding is heavy, call your health care provider.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>You are not likely to get pregnant if you take DOLISHALE at the same time everyday as directed by your health care provider. Because regular monthly bleeding does not occur on DOLISHALE, it may be difficult to recognize if you get pregnant. If you suspect that you may be pregnant, or if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea/vomiting or unusual breast tenderness, you should have a pregnancy test and you should contact your health care professional. Stop taking DOLISHALE if you are pregnant.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>1.    BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Before you start taking DOLISHALE.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>And</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Anytime you are not sure what to do.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>2. THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE <content styleCode="italics">DOLISHALE </content>IS TO TAKE ONE PILL <content styleCode="bold">EVERY DAY </content>AT THE <content styleCode="bold">SAME TIME</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you miss pills, you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS" below.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>3. MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH DURING THE FIRST 1 to 3 PACKS OF PILLS.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking DOLISHALE. This will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your health care professional.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>4. MOST WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR BLEEDING DURING THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF TAKING <content styleCode="italics">DOLISHALE</content>. Do not stop taking your pills even if you are having bleeding or spotting. If the bleeding or spotting lasts for more than 7 consecutive days, talk to your health care provider.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>5. MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>6. IF YOU VOMIT (within 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS. IF YOU HAVE DIARRHEA or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, including some antibiotics, your pills may not work as well.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Use a back-up nonhormonal method (such as condoms and/or spermicide) until you check with your health care professional.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>7. IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO TAKE <content styleCode="italics">DOLISHALE</content>, talk to your health care professional about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the "birth-control pill" or "the pill") should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This leaflet will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your health care professional. You should discuss the information provided in this leaflet with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your health care professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>DOLISHALE is a birth-control pill that is taken every day. When you take DOLISHALE, the lining of your uterus does not undergo the changes needed for menstruation, and therefore you do not have regular menstrual periods. You are likely to have unscheduled or unplanned bleeding or spotting when you start to use DOLISHALE. The number of days each month with unscheduled bleeding and spotting usually decreases over time for the majority of women. When using DOLISHALE, the convenience of having no regular menstrual periods should be weighed against the inconvenience of unscheduled or unplanned breakthrough bleeding and spotting. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Oral contraceptives or "birth-control pills" or "the pill" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than other nonsurgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly, without missing any pills the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1 to 2% per year (1 to 2 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use). Average failure rates are approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when women who miss pills are included. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In comparison, average failure rates for other methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows:</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DOLISHALE is a non-cyclic oral contraceptive that provides a low daily dose of estrogen and progestin; however, DOLISHALE provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis (13 additional weeks of hormone intake per year) than conventional cyclic oral contraceptives containing the same strength of synthetic estrogens and similar strength of progestins.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="bold">1. Risk of Developing Blood Clots </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Users of combination oral contraceptives have a higher risk of developing blood clots compared to non-users. This risk is highest during the first year of combination oral contraceptive use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your health care professional about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby or after a midtrimester pregnancy termination. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill.

                        <paragraph>The risk of blood clots is greater in users of combination oral contraceptives compared to nonusers. This risk may be higher in users of high-dose pills (those containing 0.05 mg or more of estrogen) and may also be greater with longer use. In addition, some of these increased risks may continue for a number of years after stopping combination oral contraceptives. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of combination oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The excess risk of blood clots is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. This increased risk is lower than blood clots associated with pregnancy. The use of combination oral contraceptives also increases the risk of other clotting disorders, including heart attack and stroke. Blood clots in veins cause death in 1% to 2% of cases. The risk of clotting is further increased in women with other conditions. Examples include: smoking, high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, certain inherited or acquired clotting disorders, obesity, surgery or injury, recent delivery or second trimester abortion, prolonged inactivity or bedrest. If possible, combination oral contraceptives should be stopped before surgery and during prolonged inactivity or bedrest.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events. This risk increases with age and amount of smoking and is quite pronounced in women over 35. Women who use combination oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. If you smoke you should talk to your health care professional before taking combination oral contraceptives.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes or transient ischemic attacks (blockage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain), and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Women with migraine (especially migraine/headache with neurological symptoms such as aura) who take oral contraceptives also may be at higher risk of stroke and must not use combination oral contraceptives (see section <content styleCode="bold">

In addition, a possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancers in two studies in which a few women who developed these very rare cancers were found to have used oral contraceptives for long periods. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All methods of birth control and pregnancy are associated with a risk of developing certain diseases which may lead to disability or death. An estimate of the number of deaths associated with different methods of birth control and pregnancy has been calculated and is shown in the following table.</paragraph>
                        <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM9"/>
                        <paragraph ID="ID265">In the above table, the risk of death from any birth-control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7 to 26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, except for those women over the age of 40, when the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older high-dose pills. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy, nonsmoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. Older women, as all women, who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with the individual patient needs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Unscheduled bleeding or spotting is likely to occur while you are taking DOLISHALE. Unscheduled bleeding or spotting occurs most often during the first seven pill packs of DOLISHALE use. It tends to decrease with subsequent pill packs of use, but may occur after you have been taking DOLISHALE for some time. In a study of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 60% of women had bleeding and/or spotting during the sixth pill pack of use. Bleeding and/or spotting decreased to 48% during pill pack 9, and to 41% during pill pack 13. In this study, the percentage of women who discontinued treatment, at least in part, due to unscheduled bleeding or spotting was 18%.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="bold">1. Use of Oral Contraceptives Before or During Early Pregnancy </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because regular monthly bleeding does not occur on DOLISHALE, an unexpected pregnancy may be difficult to recognize. If you suspect you may be pregnant, or if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea/vomiting or unusual breast tenderness, a pregnancy test should be performed and you should contact your health care professional. Stop taking DOLISHALE if you are pregnant. Pregnancy is unlikely if the pill is taken as directed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy. You should check with your health care professional about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If you are breast-feeding, consult your health care professional before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use oral contraceptives while breast-feeding. You should use another method of contraception since breast-feeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breast-feed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your health care professional you are taking birth-control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth-control pills.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Certain drugs may interact with birth-control pills to make them less effective in preventing pregnancy or cause an increase in unscheduled bleeding. Such drugs include rifampin, drugs used for epilepsy such as barbiturates (for example, phenobarbital) and phenytoin (Dilantin<sup>®</sup>is one brand of this drug), primidone (Mysoline<sup>®</sup>), topiramate (Topamax<sup>®</sup>), carbamazepine (Tegretol<sup>®</sup>is one brand of this drug), phenylbutazone (Butazolidin<sup>®</sup>is one brand), some drugs used for HIV or AIDS such as ritonavir (Norvir<sup>®</sup>), modafinil (Provigil<sup>®</sup>) and possibly certain antibiotics (such as ampicillin and other penicillins, and tetracyclines), and herbal products containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum). You may also need to use a nonhormonal method of contraception during any pill pack in which you take drugs that can make oral contraceptives less effective.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>You may be at higher risk for a specific type of liver dysfunction if you take troleandomycin and oral contraceptives at the same time.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>You should inform your health care professional about all medicines you are taking, including nonprescription products.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>You are likely to have unscheduled or unplanned bleeding or spotting when you start to use DOLISHALE. The number of days each month with bleeding or spotting usually decreases over time in the majority of women. In a study of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, about 5 out of 10 women had 7 or more days of bleeding or spotting while using their third 28-day pill pack of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol. The number of women with 7 or more days of bleeding or spotting decreased to 3 out of 10 women during the use of their seventh pill pack. Among women who continued to use levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets for one year, about 6 out of 10 women had no bleeding or spotting during their last month of use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Do not stop taking DOLISHALE because of bleeding or spotting as this will increase your chance of getting pregnant. If the spotting or bleeding continues for more than 7 consecutive days or if the bleeding is heavy, call your health care provider.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>You are not likely to get pregnant if you take DOLISHALE at the same time everyday as directed by your health care provider. Because regular monthly bleeding does not occur on DOLISHALE, it may be difficult to recognize if you get pregnant. If you suspect that you may be pregnant, or if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea/vomiting or unusual breast tenderness, you should have a pregnancy test and you should contact your health care professional. Stop taking DOLISHALE if you are pregnant.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>1.    BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Before you start taking DOLISHALE.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>And</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>2. THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE <content styleCode="italics">DOLISHALE </content>IS TO TAKE ONE PILL <content styleCode="bold">EVERY DAY </content>AT THE <content styleCode="bold">SAME TIME</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If you miss pills, you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS" below.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>3. MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH DURING THE FIRST 1 to 3 PACKS OF PILLS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking DOLISHALE. This will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your health care professional.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>4. MOST WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR BLEEDING DURING THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF TAKING <content styleCode="italics">DOLISHALE</content>. Do not stop taking your pills even if you are having bleeding or spotting. If the bleeding or spotting lasts for more than 7 consecutive days, talk to your health care provider.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>5. MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>6.  IF YOU VOMIT (within 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS. IF YOU HAVE DIARRHEA or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, including some antibiotics, your pills may not work as well.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use a back-up nonhormonal method (such as condoms and/or spermicide) until you check with your health care professional.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>7. IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO TAKE <content styleCode="italics">DOLISHALE</content>, talk to your health care professional about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The incidence of pill failure resulting in pregnancy is approximately 1 to 2% per year (1 to 2 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) if taken every day as directed, but the average failure rate is approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) including women who do not always take the pill exactly as directed without missing any pills. If you do become pregnant, the risk to the fetus is minimal, but you should stop taking your pills and discuss the pregnancy with your health care professional.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives.

                        <paragraph>Your health care professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the health care professional believes that it is appropriate to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your health care professional if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your health care professional, because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Do not use the drug for any condition other than the one for which it was prescribed. This drug has been prescribed specifically for you; do not give it to others who may want birth-control pills.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In addition to preventing pregnancy, some information suggests that the use of oral contraceptives provide certain other benefits. The benefits are:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Decreased blood loss, and less iron may be lost. Therefore, anemia due to iron deficiency is less likely to occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Pain or other cycle-related symptoms may occur less frequently.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Ovarian cysts may occur less frequently.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Noncancerous cysts or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Acute pelvic inflammatory disease may occur less frequently.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Oral contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer: cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If you want more information about birth-control pills, ask your health care professional or pharmacist. They have a more technical leaflet called the Professional Labeling which you may wish to read.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.</paragraph>
