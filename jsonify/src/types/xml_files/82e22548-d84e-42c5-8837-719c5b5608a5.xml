Patients can be seriously injured or injure others during complex sleep behaviors. Such injuries may result in a fatal outcome. Other complex sleep behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have also been reported. Patients usually do not remember these events.

                        <paragraph ID="ID209">Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets are CNS depressant and can impair daytime function in some patients even when used as prescribed. Prescribers should monitor for excess depressant effects, but impairment can occur in the absence of subjective symptoms, and may not be reliably detected by ordinary clinical exam (i.e. less than formal psychomotor testing). While pharmacodynamic tolerance or adaptation to some adverse depressant effects of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets may develop, patients using zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets should be cautioned against driving or engaging in other hazardous activities or activities requiring complete mental alertness the day after use.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID211">Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative/hypnotic drugs, including zolpidem.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The following tables enumerate treatment-emergent adverse reactions frequencies that were observed at an incidence equal to 1% or greater among patients with insomnia who received zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets in placebo-controlled trials. Events reported by investigators were classified utilizing the MedDRA dictionary for the purpose of establishing event frequencies. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice, in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in these clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving related drug products and uses, since each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions. However, the cited figures provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population studied.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following tables were derived from results of two placebo-controlled efficacy trials involving zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets. These trials involved patients with primary insomnia who were treated for 3 weeks with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets at doses of 12.5 mg (Table 1) or 6.25 mg (Table 2), respectively. The tables include only adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 1% for zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets patients and with an incidence greater than that seen in the placebo patients. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Immediate-release zolpidem tartrate was administered to 3,660 subjects in clinical trials throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events, similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary of preferred terms.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportions of the 3,660 individuals exposed to zolpidem, at all doses, who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving zolpidem. All reported treatment-emergent adverse events are included, except those already listed in the table above of adverse events in placebo-controlled studies, those coding terms that are so general as to be uninformative, and those events where a drug cause was remote. It is important to emphasize that, although the events reported did occur during treatment with AMBIEN, they were not necessarily caused by it.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in greater than 1/100 subjects; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.</paragraph>

Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances. Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time. Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects.</paragraph>

It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following: impaired control over drug use, compulsive use, continued use despite harm, and craving. Drug addiction is a treatable disease, using a multidisciplinary approach, but relapse is common.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID274">General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. Zolpidem's sedative hypnotic effect was shown to be reduced by flumazenil and therefore may be useful; however, flumazenil administration may contribute to the appearance of neurological symptoms (convulsions). As in all cases of drug overdose, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed. Hypotension and CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention. Sedating drugs should be withheld following zolpidem overdosage, even if excitation occurs. The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined, although hemodialysis studies in patients with renal failure receiving therapeutic doses have demonstrated that zolpidem is not dialyzable.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage.</paragraph>

Zolpidem has no appreciable binding affinity for α5 subunit containing GABA A receptors. This binding profile may explain the relative absence of myorelaxant effects in animal studies. Zolpidem has no appreciable binding affinity for dopaminergic D2, serotonergic 5HT<sub>2</sub>, adrenergic, histaminergic or muscarinic receptors.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Adult outpatients (18 to 64 years) with primary insomnia (N=212) were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 3-week trial comparing zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg and placebo. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg decreased wake time after sleep onset (WASO) for the first 7 hours during the first 2 nights and for the first 5 hours after 2 weeks of treatment. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg were superior to placebo on objective measures (polysomnography recordings) of sleep induction (by decreasing latency to persistent sleep [LPS]) during the first 2 nights of treatment and after 2 weeks of treatment. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg were also superior to placebo on the patient reported global impression regarding the aid to sleep after the first 2 nights and after 3 weeks of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elderly outpatients (≥ 65 years) with primary insomnia (N=205) were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, 3-week trial comparing zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg and placebo. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg decreased wake time after sleep onset (WASO) for the first 6 hours during the first 2 nights and the first 4 hours after 2 weeks of treatment. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg were superior to placebo on objective measures (polysomnography recordings) of sleep induction (by decreasing LPS) during the first 2 nights of treatment and after 2 weeks on treatment. Zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg were superior to placebo on the patient reported global impression regarding the aid to sleep after the first 2 nights and after 3 weeks of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In both studies, in patients treated with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets, polysomnography showed increased wakefulness at the end of the night compared to placebo-treated patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 24-week double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study in adult outpatients (18 to 64 years) with primary insomnia (N=1025), zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg administered as needed (3 to 7 nights per week) was superior to placebo over 24 weeks, on patient global impression regarding aid to sleep, and on patient-reported specific sleep parameters for sleep induction and sleep maintenance with no significant increased frequency of drug intake observed over time.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In five clinical studies (three controlled studies in adults [18 to 64 years of age] administered zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg and two controlled studies in the elderly [≥ 65 years of age] administered zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg), the effect of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets on vigilance, memory, or motor function were assessed using neurocognitive tests. In these studies, no significant decrease in performance was observed eight hours after a nighttime dose. In addition, no evidence of next-day residual effects was detected with zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets 12.5 mg and 6.25 mg using self-ratings of sedation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the 3-week studies, next-day somnolence was reported by 15% of the adult patients who received 12.5 mg zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets versus 2% of the placebo group; next-day somnolence was reported by 6% of the elderly patients who received 6.25 mg zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets versus 5% of the placebo group [see ADVERSE REACTIONS (<linkHtml href="#ID224">6</linkHtml>)]. In a 6-month study, the overall incidence of next-day somnolence was 5.7% in the zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets group as compared to 2% in the placebo group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Rebound insomnia, defined as a dose-dependent worsening in sleep parameters (latency, sleep efficiency, and number of awakenings) compared with baseline following discontinuation of treatment, is observed with short- and intermediate-acting hypnotics. In the two 3-week placebo-controlled studies in patients with primary insomnia, a rebound effect was only observed on the first night after abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets. On the second night, there was no worsening compared to baseline in the zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 6-month placebo-controlled study in which zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets were taken as needed (3 to 7 nights per week), within the first month a rebound effect was observed for Total Sleep Time (not for WASO) during the first night off medication. After this first month period, no further rebound insomnia was observed. After final treatment discontinuation no rebound was observed.</paragraph>
