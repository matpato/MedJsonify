                  <paragraph>4.2. Posology and method of administration
  <br/>
Posology/frequency and duration of administration
  <br/>
The dosage is to be individualized by the physician depending on age, weight, clinical condition and in particular the patient’s hydration state. Serum electrolyte concentrations must be monitored during treatment.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>In general, 500 to 3000 ml per 24 hours for adults, adolescents and elderly and 20 to 100 ml/kg per 24 hours for infants and children is recommended for treatment of isotonic extracellular dehydration and sodium depletion unless otherwise prescribed by the doctor.
  <br/>
The dosage when used as a diluent should be determined by the nature and the dose regimen of the diluted drug. In general 50 to 250 ml of fluid is sufficient.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Special warnings and precautions for use
  <br/>
The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilution is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration. The risk of congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration.
  <br/>
The solution contains 154 mmol/l sodium (Na+) and 154 mmol/l chloride (Cl-); the osmolarity is about 308 mOsm/l and the pH is 5.5 (4.5-7.0).
  <br/>
Careful clinical monitoring is required at the beginning of any intravenous infusion.
  <br/>
Administrations should be periodically and carefully monitored. Clinical and biological parameters, in particular serum electrolyte concentrations should be monitored.
  <br/>
In preterm or term neonates, sodium retention can be seen because renal function is not yet fully developed. Repeated infusions of sodium chloride in neonates should therefore only be given after determination of the serum sodium levels.
  <br/>
Sodium-containing solutions should be used with caution in cases of hypertension, heart failure, peripheral or pulmonary edema, impaired renal function, preeclampsia, aldosteronism or other conditions and treatments with sodium accumulation (e.g. corticosteroid therapy).
  <br/>
Pseudohyponatremia is a condition in which plasma sodium is falsely low as measured by conventional methods in spite of the fact that it is not actually low. This may occur when large molecules are at a high concentration at an abnormally high level and, consequently, when the plasma water ratio falls abnormally. It has been reported that associated hyperlipemia and hyperproteinemia can also be seen in patients with diabetes mellitus. Real values can be obtained by evaluating the concentration based on plasma/water ratio.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Excessive administration of potassium-free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia. Serum potassium levels should be maintained and potassium supplemented as required.
  <br/>
To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing any of these solutions with other additives that may be prescribed, the final mixture should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration and periodically during administration.
  <br/>
If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.
  <br/>
Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.
  <br/>
Laboratory tests:
  <br/>
Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require normalization of these values with alternative solutions.
  <br/>
Warnings and precautions for pediatric use:
  <br/>
In neonates or in very small infants even small volumes of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance. Care must be exercised in treatment of neonates, especially pre-term neonates, whose renal function may be immature and whose ability to excrete fluid and solute loads may be limited. Fluid intake, urine output, and serum electrolytes should be monitored closely.
  <br/>
Warnings and precautions for use in elderly:
  <br/>
In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious. Starting at the low end of the dosing range is recommended in elderly considering the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

  <br/>
Some of the drugs and solutions added to the solution may be incompatible. As in all parenteral solutions, compatibility with additional medication should be evaluated by the physician.
  <br/>
If other substances are to be added to the solution, aseptic technique should be used and shaken until mixed. It should be ensured that there is no discoloration, insoluble particles and crystallization after the drugs are added into TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE.
  <br/>
Caution should be exercised because of the risk of sodium and water retention when used with corticosteroids and carbenoxolone due to its sodium content.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Undesirable effects are not expected in normal conditions of treatment.
  <br/>
Undesirable effects may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential. The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives. Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted. Injudicious intravenous sodium chloride therapy (e.g. post-operatively and in patients with impaired cardiac or renal function) may cause hypernatraemia. Osmotically induced water shifts decrease intracellular volume, resulting in dehydration of internal organs, especially the brain, which may lead to thrombosis and haemorrhage.
  <br/>
If administered sub-cutaneously, any addition to the isotonic solution could render it hypertonic and cause pain at the site of injection.
  <br/>
Administration of large doses may give rise to sodium accumulation, oedema, and hyperchloraemic acidosis.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If an adverse reaction does occur during administration, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures.

  <br/>
ATC code: B05XA03
  <br/>
TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE is an isotonic solution, with an approximate osmolarity of 308 mOsm/l.
  <br/>
The pharmacodynamic properties of the solution are those of the sodium and chloride ions in maintaining the fluid and electrolyte balance.
  <br/>
Ions, such as sodium, circulate through the cell membrane, using various mechanisms of transport, among which is the sodium pump (Na-K-ATPase) Sodium plays an important role in neurotransmission, cardiac electrophysiology and in renal metabolism.
  <br/>
Chloride is mainly an extracellular anion. Intracellular chloride is in high concentration in red blood cells and gastric mucosa. Reabsorption of chloride follows reabsorption of sodium.
  <br/>
The pharmacodynamic properties of the added drugs are the same as the pharmacodynamic properties of the added drug.

                  <paragraph>General properties
  <br/>
Pharmacokinetic properties of TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE are those of its components (sodium and chloride).
  <br/>
Absorption:
  <br/>
Active substances in drugs administered intravenously reach their maximum plasma concentrations immediately after administration.
  <br/>
Distribution:
  <br/>
Sodium distribution varies according to tissues: it is fast in muscles, liver, kidney, cartilage and skin; it is slow in erythrocytes and neurons; it is very slow in the bone.
  <br/>
Chloride is mainly distributed in extracellular fluids.
  <br/>
Biotransformation:
  <br/>
The half-life after radioactively labeled sodium (24Na) injection is 11-13 days for 99% of injected sodium and one year for the remaining 1%.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Chloride closely monitors sodium metabolism and changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in chloride concentration.
  <br/>
Elimination:
  <br/>
Sodium is excreted primarily by the renal route, but at the same time the vast majority is reabsorbed by the renal route. A small amount of sodium is excreted with feces and sweat.
  <br/>
Since chloride metabolically monitors sodium, it is mainly excreted by the renal route but also in lesser amounts in feces and sweat.
  <br/>
Linearity/Non-linearity:
  <br/>
Electrolytes in the TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE composition show a linear pharmacokinetic behavior when administered to the body at therapeutic doses to complete their deficiency.

  <br/>
Incompatibility of the medicinal product to be added with the solution must be assessed before addition. In the absence of compatibility data, this solution must not be mixed with other medicinal products.
  <br/>
It is the responsibility of the physician to judge the incompatibility of an additive medication with the solution by checking for eventual color change and/or eventual precipitate, insoluble complexes or crystals apparition. The prescribing information of the drug to be added to TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE must be consulted to decide whether the additive is compatible.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Before adding a drug, its solubility and stability at the pH of TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE should be verified.
  <br/>
TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE should be immediately used following the addition of a compatible drug.
  <br/>
Those additives known to be incompatible should not be used.
  <br/>

                  <paragraph>Directions for use
  <br/>
Solution should be inspected visually before use.
  <br/>
The administration is by intravenous route with sterile sets.
  <br/>
Only products that are clear, particle-free and intact in packaging integrity should be used.
  <br/>
The administration should be started as soon as possible after the application set is attached to the product.
  <br/>
In order to prevent an air embolisation that may occur due to the residual air in the bag, no serial connection should be made with other infusion fluids.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Pressurizing intravenous solutions contained in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates can result in air embolism if the residual air in the container is not fully evacuated prior to administration.
  <br/>
The solution should be applied using the aseptic technique through the sterile application set. In order to prevent air from entering the system, liquid must be passed through the application set before use.
  <br/>
Additional medication may be added before and during infusion with the aid of injection a needle in aseptic conditions. The final product’s isotonicity should be determined before parenteral administration.
  <br/>
The added drug must be completely mixed with the solution before application to the patient. Solutions containing additives should be used immediately and not stored.
  <br/>
Adding other medication or using an incorrect administration technique might cause the appearance of fever reactions due to the possible introduction of pyrogens. In case of adverse reaction, infusion must be stopped immediately.
  <br/>
For single use.
  <br/>
Do not store partially used solutions.
  <br/>
Do not reconnect partially used bags.
