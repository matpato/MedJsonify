Dosage and method of administration Dosage / frequency and duration of administration: In intravenous infusion administration: The dose to be administered, infusion rate and duration of administration should be adjusted by the physician according to the indication for which the solution is used, the patient's age, body weight and clinical condition, the treatment administered to the patient with the solution, and the clinical and laboratory response to the treatment. In general, in order to provide normal blood volume in blood losses, TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER is required 3-5 times the amount of blood lost. In general, doses of 500 - 3000 mL per day are recommended for adults and 20 - 100 mL per kg of body weight per day for children. The rate of administration in adults is usually 40 mL per kg of body weight per day. Method of administration: Application is performed intravenously with sterile apyrogen sets.

Additional information regarding special populations: Renal/Liver failure: Since there is no study specifically conducted for these populations, there is no special dosage recommendation for this patient group. Turkflex Lactated Ringer may not show its alkalizing effect since lactate metabolism may be impaired in patients with hepatic failure. Pediatric population: The effectiveness and safe use of lactated Ringer's solutions in children have not been investigated with appropriate and well-controlled studies; however, there is information in the medical literature indicating the use of electrolyte solutions in the pediatric population. Lactated solutions should be administered with special care to newborns and infants younger than 6 months.

                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
In the pediatric population, infusion rates are 5 mL/kg per hour on average, but they vary according to age as follows: • 6-8 mL/kg/hour in infants older than 1 month • 4-6 mL/kg/hour in children aged 1-2 years • 2-4 mL/kg/hour in children older than 2 years It is recommended to administer an average dose of 3.4 mL/kg/burn rate in the first 24 hours and 6.3 mL/kg/burn rate on the second day in children with burns. The average dose in children with severe head trauma is 2,850 mL/m2. During surgery or when necessary, the infusion may be faster or the total volume administered may be greater. Geriatric population: When determining the type of infusion solution and the rate and volume of administration in geriatric patients, it should be taken into account that heart, kidney, liver diseases and other diseases and drug use are more common in this age group.

Special warnings and precautions for use Hypersensitivity reactions If any signs or symptoms suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction occur during administration, the infusion should be stopped immediately. Appropriate therapeutic interventions should be implemented as clinically indicated. Incompatibilities Ceftriaxone: In patients older than 28 days, including adults, ceftriaxone should not be used simultaneously with calcium-containing solutions, including TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER, through the same infusion line. If the same administration set is to be used for successive applications, the set should be thoroughly rinsed with compatible solutions before administration. For the use of TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER with ceftriaxone in newborn infants younger than 28 days, see “4.3. Contraindications”. Electrolyte balance Hypernatremia: In cases of hypernatremia, TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should only be used after careful investigation of the cause of the underlying disease and in cases where alternative intravenous fluid treatments cannot be applied. In such cases, it is recommended to monitor plasma sodium levels and plasma volume and apply.
  <br/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should be applied with special care in cases that increase the tendency to hypernatremia (such as adrenocortical insufficiency, diabetes insipidus or widespread tissue damage) and in patients with cardiac disease. Hyperchloremia: In cases of hyperchloremia, TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should be used only after the cause of the underlying disease has been carefully investigated and in cases where alternative intravenous fluid treatments cannot be applied. In such cases, it is recommended to apply by monitoring plasma chloride levels and plasma acid-base balance.
  <br/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should be administered with special care in conditions that increase the tendency to hyperchloremia (such as renal failure and renal tubular acidosis, diabetes insipidus), in patients who have undergone urinary diversion or who are taking certain diuretics (such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide) or steroids (androgens, estrogens, corticosteroids), and in patients with severe dehydration. Use in patients with potassium deficiency: Although the amount of potassium in the composition of TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER is similar to that of plasma, the solution should not be used for this purpose, as it is not at a level that will have a beneficial effect in cases of severe potassium deficiency. Use in patients at risk of hyperkalemia: TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should be applied with special care in conditions that increase the tendency to hyperkalemia (such as severe renal failure or adrenocortical insufficiency, acute dehydration or widespread tissue damage or burns) and in patients with cardiac disease. It is recommended to closely monitor plasma potassium levels in patients at risk of hyperkalemia. Use in patients at risk of hypercalcemia: Calcium chloride is an irritant; therefore, care should be taken not to leak solution out of the vein when administered intravenously or intramuscularly.

                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
Solutions containing calcium salts should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function or high vitamin D levels, such as sarcoidosis. In addition, it should be avoided in patients with a history of calcium stones in the kidneys. Fluid balance / kidney functions Use in patients with impaired renal function: TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should be administered with special care to patients with impaired renal function. In such patients, administration of TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER may cause sodium and/or potassium accumulation. Use in patients at risk of fluid and/or solute overload and electrolyte disturbances: Depending on the volume administered and the rate of administration, intravenous administration of TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER may cause the following conditions: - Fluid and/or solute overload leading to overhydration and congestive conditions (including pulmonary congestion and edema).

                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
- Clinically relevant electrolyte disturbances and acid-base imbalance. During long-term parenteral administration, the patient's clinical condition and laboratory parameters should be monitored at regular intervals whenever the patient's condition or the rate of intravenous fluid administration requires it. High-volume infusions should be administered with special monitoring in patients with heart or lung failure. Use in patients with hypervolemia, overhydration or conditions that lead to sodium retention and edema: TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should be administered with special caution in patients with hypervolemia or overhydration. TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should be administered with special caution in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism, secondary hyperaldosteronism (e.g. hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal artery stenosis or nephrosclerosis) or conditions that may lead to sodium retention, fluid overload and edema such as preeclampsia due to its sodium chloride content (See Section 4.5.).

                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
Acid-base balance Use in patients at risk of alkalosis: TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER should be administered with special care in patients at risk of alkalosis. Since lactate is metabolized to bicarbonate, the solution may cause metabolic alkalosis in such patients or may aggravate an existing metabolic alkalosis. Although convulsions may be induced in lactate-induced alkalosis, this is not a common condition. Other warnings Application with citrate anticoagulated/stored blood: Due to the calcium it contains, it is not recommended to add TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER to citrate anticoagulated/stored blood, to citrate anticoagulated/stored blood, to administer simultaneously or to administer together from the same infusion system. Use in patients with type 2 diabetes: Lactate is a substrate for gluconeogenesis. This should be taken into consideration when using TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Interactions related to the sodium content of the solution: - In patients using drugs such as corticosteroids that may increase the risk of sodium and fluid overload (with edema and hypertension), TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER is recommended to be administered with caution. Interactions related to the potassium content of the solution: Since TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER contains potassium, it is recommended to be administered with caution when used with the following drugs known to cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia: - Potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride, spironolactone, triamterene, alone or in combination). - Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. - Tacrolimus, cyclosporine. In patients receiving such drugs, especially in cases of severe renal impairment, the administration of potassium may result in a severe and potentially fatal hyperkalemia.

                     <br/>
Interactions related to the calcium contained in the solution: Administering calcium may increase the effects of digitalis and may cause serious or potentially fatal arrhythmias in the heart. Therefore, in patients receiving treatment with digitalis group drugs, large volumes and rapid infusion of the solution is not recommended. It is recommended that TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER be administered with caution if it is to be used with thiazide group diuretics or vitamin D, which may increase the risk of hypercalcemia.

                     <br/>
Bisphosphonates, fluoride, some fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines have reduced absorption (reduced bioavailability) when administered with calcium. Interactions related to the lactate contained in the solution (metabolized to bicarbonate): It is recommended that TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER be administered with caution if used with drugs whose renal elimination is pH-dependent: Since bicarbonate formed as a result of lactate metabolism alkalinizes the urine, TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER may affect the elimination of such drugs: - Since bicarbonate formed as a result of lactate metabolism alkalinizes the urine, renal excretion of acidic drugs such as salicylates, barbiturates and lithium increases. - The renal elimination of alkaline drugs such as sympathomimetic drugs (e.g. ephedrine, pseudoephedrine) and stimulant drugs (e.g. dexamphetamine sulfate, fenfluramine hydrochloride) is slowed down.

Excessive doses or too rapid administration of TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER may lead to water and sodium overload, which may lead to the risk of edema (peripheral and/or pulmonary edema), especially in cases where sodium excretion from the kidneys is impaired. In this case, renal dialysis treatment may be required. Excessive administration of potassium may lead to hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal failure. Symptoms of hyperkalemia include paresthesia in the extremities, muscle weakness, paralysis, cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, cardiac arrest and mental confusion. Excessive calcium administration may cause hypercalcemia. Symptoms of hypercalcemia include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, mental disorders, polydipsia, polyuria, nephrocalcinosis, renal stone formation and, in more severe cases, cardiac arrhythmias and coma. Too rapid infusion of calcium salts can cause a chalky taste in the mouth, flushing, especially of the face, and peripheral vasodilation, as well as many other symptoms of hypercalcemia. Mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia is caused by calcium and D 
  <br/>
It is corrected by stopping the administration of drugs such as vitamin. If hypercalcemia is severe, treatments such as loop diuretics, hemodialysis, calcitonin, bisphosphonate and trisodium edetate should be started urgently. Sodium lactate overdose can lead to metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may be accompanied by hypokalemia. Symptoms include mood changes, weakness, breathlessness, muscle weakness and irregular heartbeat. Hypertonicity, twitching and tetany can be seen in muscles, especially in hypocalcemic patients. Treatment of metabolic alkalosis due to bicarbonate overdose mainly consists of appropriate correction of fluid and electrolyte balance. Complementation of calcium, chloride and potassium deficiencies is especially important. If the overdose is due to drugs added to the solution, the signs and symptoms of the overdose depend on the properties of the added drug. If the dose is accidentally exceeded during treatment, the administration should be stopped and the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms related to the drug administered. If necessary, symptomatic and supportive treatments should be applied.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Intravenous solutions / Solutions affecting electrolyte balance ATC code: B05BB01 TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER is an isotonic electrolyte solution. The composition and concentration of electrolytes in TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER are designed to be similar to those of electrolytes in plasma. The pharmacological properties of TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER consist of the pharmacological properties of its components (sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride and lactate). The main effect of TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER is the expansion of fluid in the extracellular compartment, including interstitial and intravascular fluids. Lactate ions are metabolized to bicarbonate, mainly in the liver, creating an alkalizing effect on the plasma. In healthy volunteers given lactated Ringer's solution, changes in central venous pressure were associated with atrial natriuretic peptide secretion.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
Lactated Ringer's solutions applied to healthy volunteers decreased serum osmolality, increased blood pH and provided the first urination in a shorter time compared to normal saline application. No significant changes were observed in glucagon, epinephrine, blood glucose and insulin levels in aortic surgery patients treated with Lactated Ringer's solutions. When a drug is added to TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER, the pharmacodynamic properties of the resulting solution depend on the properties of the added drug.

                  <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic properties of TURKFLEKS LACTATED RINGER consist of the pharmacokinetic properties of its components (sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride and lactate).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Infusion of Lactated Ringer's solutions in hemodynamically stable adults does not cause an increase in circulating lactate levels. The pharmacokinetics of D-lactate and L-lactate are similar.
  <br/>
Absorption:
  <br/>
Active substances in intravenously administered drugs reach maximum plasma concentrations immediately after administration.
  <br/>
Distribution:
  <br/>
The half-life after injection of radioactively labeled sodium (24Na) is 11-13 days for 99% of the injected sodium and one year for the remaining 1%. Distribution varies according to the tissues: fast in muscle, liver, kidney, cartilage and skin, slow in erythrocytes and neurons, and very slow in bone.
  <br/>
Potassium in the extracellular fluid enters the cell by active transport until it reaches 40 times its concentration outside the cell. Glucose, insulin, and oxygen facilitate the entry of potassium into the cell. In healthy adults, plasma potassium concentration is in the range of 3.5-5 mEq/l. In newborns, plasma levels can reach up to 7.7 mEq/l. However, since plasma potassium levels do not fully reflect intracellular potassium levels, cellular hypokalemia may occur even when plasma levels are normal. Changes in pH in the extracellular fluid also cause changes in plasma potassium concentration. A 0.1 unit change in plasma pH causes an inversely proportional change in plasma potassium concentration of 0.6 mEq/l.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Chloride is normally found in low amounts in bone tissue and in high amounts in some components of connective tissue, such as collagen tissue. It is also found in high concentrations in erythrocytes and gastric mucosa. The levels of chloride, the main anion of extracellular fluid, in the body are closely related to changes in sodium concentration. Abnormalities in sodium metabolism usually result in changes in chloride concentration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Calcium is an important cation for the continuation of life both intracellularly and extracellularly. Depending on the requirement, it either remains in the plasma or distributes to the tissues. Calcium also passes into the placenta and breast milk.
  <br/>
Lactate is converted to bicarbonate by oxidation in serum. Lactate distributed to the liver is metabolized by gluconeogenesis in the liver and converted to bicarbonate.
  <br/>
Biotransformation:
  <br/>
Sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride do not undergo any biotransformation. Depending on the requirement, they are either distributed to body fluids and tissues or eliminated.
  <br/>
Lactate is metabolized by both oxidation and gluconeogenesis, especially in the liver, to form bicarbonate within approximately 1-2 hours.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Elimination:
  <br/>
Sodium is mainly excreted renally, but most of it is also reabsorbed renally. A small amount of sodium is excreted in feces and sweat. Excretion through the skin is unimportant unless there is excessive sweating.
  <br/>
Closely following sodium metabolism, chloride ion is also excreted mainly in urine. Chloride reabsorption from the kidneys generally follows sodium reabsorption. In addition, some amount is also excreted through sweat.
  <br/>
80-90% of potassium is excreted by the kidneys. The rest is excreted in feces and a very small amount is excreted through sweat. Potassium is filtered in the glomeruli, reabsorbed in the proximal tubules and secreted in the distal tubules by Na-K exchange. Tubular secretion of potassium is also affected by hydrogen ion exchange, acid-base balance and adrenal hormones.
  <br/>
Calcium is excreted mainly in feces; small amounts are also excreted by sweat glands.
  <br/>
Linearity/non-linearity: Lactated Ringer's solutions exhibit linear pharmacokinetics over the recommended dosage range.
