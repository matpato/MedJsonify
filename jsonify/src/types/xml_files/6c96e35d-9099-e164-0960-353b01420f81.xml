                        <paragraph>In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 x ULN) were reported in 6% of 2,230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2,230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events. </paragraph>

In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient’s baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> The safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate have not been established in females. Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action, abiraterone acetate can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0.03 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with abiraterone acetate and for 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone acetate [see Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#PREGNANCY">8.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#_102b3a1d-e9b2-cde2-8ed8-f956f9dc1161">8.3</linkHtml>)]. Abiraterone acetate should not be handled by females who are or may become pregnant [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (<linkHtml href="#HOW_SUPPLIED">16</linkHtml>)]. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>  Severe hypoglycemia has been reported when abiraterone acetate was administered to patients with pre-existing diabetes receiving medications containing thiazolidinediones (including pioglitazone) or repaglinide [see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#_662dbf34-020e-f780-ef82-fce85460d608">7.2</linkHtml>)]. Monitor blood glucose in patients with diabetes during and after discontinuation of treatment with abiraterone acetate. Assess if antidiabetic drug dosage needs to be adjusted to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.   </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Two randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trials (COU-AA-301 and COU-AA­302) enrolled patients who had metastatic CRPC in which abiraterone acetate was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg twice daily in the active treatment arms. Placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily was given to patients on the control arm. Another randomized placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial (LATITUDE) enrolled patients who had metastatic high-risk CSPC in which abiraterone acetate was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg once daily. Placebos were administered to patients in the control arm. Additionally, two other randomized, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in patients with metastatic CRPC. The safety data pooled from 2,230 patients in the 5 randomized controlled trials constitute the basis for the data presented in the Warnings and Precautions, Grade 1 to 4 adverse reactions, and Grade 1 to 4 laboratory abnormalities. In all trials, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or prior orchiectomy was required in both arms. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In the pooled data, median treatment duration was 11 months (0.1, 43) for abiraterone acetate-treated patients and 7.2 months (0.1, 43) for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) that occurred more commonly (&gt;2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory infection, cough, and headache. The most common laboratory abnormalities (&gt;20%) that occurred more commonly (≥2%) in the abiraterone acetate arm were anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Grades 3 to 4 adverse events were reported for 53% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 46% of patients in the placebo arm. Treatment discontinuation was reported in 14% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 13% of patients in the placebo arm. The common adverse events (≥1%) resulting in discontinuation of abiraterone acetate and prednisone were hepatotoxicity and cardiac disorders. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Deaths associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 7.5% of patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 6.6% of patients in the placebo arm. Of the patients in the abiraterone acetate arm, the most common cause of death was disease progression (3.3%). Other reported causes of death in &gt;5 patients included pneumonia, cardio-respiratory arrest, death (no additional information), and general physical health deterioration.   <content styleCode="bold"> </content>

                        <paragraph>Abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (<content styleCode="bold">

                        <paragraph>In a CYP2C8 drug-drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, the AUC of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with abiraterone acetate [see Clinical Pharmacology (<content styleCode="bold">

                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats, abiraterone acetate caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day throughout the period of organogenesis (gestational days 6 to 17). Findings included embryo-fetal lethality (increased post implantation loss and resorptions and decreased number of live fetuses), fetal developmental delay (skeletal effects) and urogenital effects (bilateral ureter dilation) at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day, decreased fetal ano-genital distance at ≥30 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight at 100 mg/kg/day. Doses ≥10 mg/kg/day caused maternal toxicity. The doses tested in rats resulted in systemic exposures (AUC) approximately 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 times, respectively, the AUC in patients. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Abiraterone acetate is converted <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, that inhibits 17 α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is expressed in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions: 1) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-hydroxy derivatives by 17α-hydroxylase activity and 2) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, respectively, by C17, 20 lyase activity. DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone. Inhibition of CYP17 by abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals [see Warnings and Precautions (<content styleCode="bold">

                        <paragraph>Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy, decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abiraterone acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo-controlled  clinical trial. It is not necessary to monitor the effect of abiraterone acetate on serum testosterone levels.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Changes in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients. </paragraph>

Assessments up to Cycle 2 Day 2 showed no large changes in the QTc interval (i.e., &gt;20 ms) from baseline. However, small increases in the QTc interval (i.e., &lt;10 ms) due to abiraterone acetate cannot be excluded due to study design limitations. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following administration of abiraterone acetate, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone have been studied in healthy subjects and in patients with metastatic CRPC. <content styleCode="italics">In vivo</content>, abiraterone acetate is converted to abiraterone. In clinical studies, abiraterone acetate plasma concentrations were below detectable levels (&lt;0.2 ng/mL) in &gt;99% of the analyzed samples.    </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate to patients with metastatic CRPC, the median time to reach maximum plasma abiraterone concentrations is 2 hours. Abiraterone accumulation is observed at steady-state, with a 2-fold higher exposure (steady-state AUC) compared to a single 1,000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At the dose of 1,000 mg daily in patients with metastatic CRPC, steady-state values (mean ± SD) of C<sub>max</sub> were 226 ± 178 ng/mL and of AUC were 993 ± 639 ng.hr/mL. No major deviation from dose proportionality was observed in the dose range of 250 mg to 1,000 mg. However, the exposure was not significantly increased when the dose was doubled from 1,000 to 2,000 mg (8% increase in the mean AUC).  </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Systemic exposure of abiraterone is increased when abiraterone acetate is administered with food. In healthy subjects abiraterone C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> were approximately 7- and 5-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a low-fat meal (7% fat, 300 calories) and approximately 17- and 10-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a high-fat (57% fat, 825 calories) meal compared to overnight fasting. Abiraterone AUC0-∞ was approximately 7-fold or 1.6-fold higher, respectively, when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered 2 hours after or 1 hour before a medium fat meal (25% fat, 491 calories) compared to overnight fasting. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Systemic exposures of abiraterone in patients with metastatic CRPC, after repeated dosing of abiraterone acetate were similar when abiraterone acetate was taken with low-fat meals for 7 days and increased approximately 2-fold when taken with high-fat meals for 7 days compared to when taken at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 1 hour before a meal for 7 days. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Given the normal variation in the content and composition of meals, taking abiraterone acetate with meals has the potential to result in increased and highly variable exposures. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following oral administration of <sup>14</sup>C-abiraterone acetate as capsules, abiraterone acetate is hydrolyzed to abiraterone (active metabolite). The conversion is likely through esterase activity (the esterases have not been identified) and is not CYP mediated. The two main circulating metabolites of abiraterone in human plasma are abiraterone sulphate (inactive) and N-oxide abiraterone sulphate (inactive), which account for about 43% of exposure each. CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are the enzymes involved in the formation of N-oxide abiraterone sulphate and SULT2A1 is involved in the formation of abiraterone sulphate.   </paragraph>

Following oral administration of <sup>14</sup>C-abiraterone acetate, approximately 88% of the radioactive dose is recovered in feces and approximately 5% in urine. The major compounds present in feces are unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone (approximately 55% and 22% of the administered dose, respectively).   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone was examined in subjects with baseline mild (N=8) or moderate (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B, respectively) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose given under fasting conditions increased approximately 1.1-fold and 3.6-fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment, respectively. The mean half-life of abiraterone is prolonged to approximately 18 hours in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and to approximately 19 hours in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In another trial, the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe (N=8) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. The systemic exposure (AUC) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7-fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. In addition, the mean protein binding was found to be lower in the severe hepatic impairment group compared to the normal hepatic function group, which resulted in a two-fold increase in the fraction of free drug in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</paragraph>

In the ESRD cohort of the trial, a single 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate dose was given under fasting conditions 1 hour after dialysis, and samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 96 hours post dose. Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1,000 mg dose did not increase in subjects with end-stage renal disease on dialysis, compared to subjects with normal renal function.   </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral abiraterone acetate doses of 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/day for males and 15, 50, and 150 mg/kg/day for females. Abiraterone acetate increased the combined incidence of interstitial cell adenomas and carcinomas in the testes at all dose levels tested. This finding is considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of abiraterone. Rats are regarded as more sensitive than humans to developing interstitial cell tumors in the testes. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in female rats at exposure levels up to 0.8 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC. Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in a 6-month study in the transgenic (Tg.rasH2) mouse.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abiraterone acetate and abiraterone was not mutagenic in an <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> microbial mutagenesis (Ames) assay or clastogenic in an <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes or an in vivo rat micronucleus assay.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In repeat-dose toxicity studies in male rats (13- and 26-weeks) and monkeys (39-weeks), atrophy, aspermia/hypospermia, and hyperplasia in the reproductive system were observed at ≥50 mg/kg/day in rats and ≥250 mg/kg/day in monkeys and were consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone. These effects were observed in rats at systemic exposures similar to humans and in monkeys at exposures approximately 0.6 times the AUC in humans. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a fertility study in male rats, reduced organ weights of the reproductive system, sperm counts, sperm motility, altered sperm morphology and decreased fertility were observed in animals dosed for 4 weeks at ≥30 mg/kg/day orally. Mating of untreated females with males that received 30 mg/kg/day oral abiraterone acetate resulted in a reduced number of corpora lutea, implantations and live embryos and an increased incidence of pre-implantation loss. Effects on male rats were reversible after 16 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a fertility study in female rats, animals dosed orally for 2 weeks until day 7 of pregnancy at ≥30 mg/kg/day had an increased incidence of irregular or extended estrous cycles and pre-implantation loss (300 mg/kg/day). There were no differences in mating, fertility, and litter parameters in female rats that received abiraterone acetate. Effects on female rats were reversible after 4 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The dose of 30 mg/kg/day in rats is approximately 0.3 times the recommended dose of 1,000 mg/day based on body surface area. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 13- and 26-week studies in rats and 13- and 39-week studies in monkeys, a reduction in circulating testosterone levels occurred with abiraterone acetate at approximately one half the human clinical exposure based on AUC. As a result, decreases in organ weights and toxicities were observed in the male and female reproductive system, adrenal glands, liver, pituitary (rats only), and male mammary glands. The changes in the reproductive organs are consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone acetate.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate with prednisone was established in three randomized placebo-controlled international clinical studies. All patients in these studies received a GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. Patients with prior ketoconazole treatment for prostate cancer and a history of adrenal gland or pituitary disorders were excluded from these trials. Concurrent use of spironolactone was not allowed during the study period. <content styleCode="bold"> </content>

                  <paragraph>In COU-AA-301 (NCT00638690), a total of 1,195 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either abiraterone acetate orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (N=797) or placebo once daily plus prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily (N=398). Patients randomized to either arm were to continue treatment until disease progression (defined as a 25% increase in PSA over the patient’s baseline/nadir together with protocol-defined radiographic progression and symptomatic or clinical progression), initiation of new treatment, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal.  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 69 years (range 39 to 95) and the racial distribution was 93% Caucasian, 3.6% Black, 1.7% Asian, and 1.6% Other. Eighty-nine percent of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance status score of 0 to 1 and 45% had a Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form score of ≥4 (patient’s reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours). Ninety percent of patients had metastases in bone and 30% had visceral involvement. Seventy percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 30% had PSA-only progression. Seventy percent of patients had previously received one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen and 30% received two regimens.  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The protocol pre-specified interim analysis was conducted after 552 deaths and showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients treated with abiraterone acetate with prednisone compared to patients in the placebo with prednisone arm (Table 9 and Figure 1). An updated survival analysis was conducted when 775 deaths (97% of the planned number of deaths for final analysis) were observed. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the interim analysis (Table 7). </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In COU-AA-302 (NCT00887198), 1,088 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either abiraterone acetate orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily (N=546) or Placebo orally once daily (N=542). Both arms were given concomitant prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Patients continued treatment until radiographic or clinical (cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation or surgical treatment for cancer, pain requiring chronic opioids, or ECOG performance status decline to 3 or more) disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Patients with moderate or severe pain, opiate use for cancer pain, or visceral organ metastases were excluded.  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patient demographics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 70 years. The racial distribution of patients treated with abiraterone acetate was 95% Caucasian, 2.8% Black, 0.7% Asian and 1.1% Other. The ECOG performance status was 0 for 76% of patients, and 1 for 24% of patients. Co-primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Baseline pain assessment was 0 to 1 (asymptomatic) in 66% of patients and 2 to 3 (mildly symptomatic) in 26% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (worst pain over the last 24 hours).  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Radiographic progression-free survival was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies and was defined by bone scan identification of 2 or more new bone lesions with confirmation (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria) and/or modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions. Analysis of rPFS utilized centrally-reviewed radiographic assessment of progression. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The planned final analysis for OS, conducted after 741 deaths (median follow up of 49 months) demonstrated a statistically significant OS improvement in patients treated with abiraterone acetate with prednisone compared to those treated with placebo with prednisone (Table 8 and Figure 2). Sixty-five percent of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 78% of patients on the placebo arm used subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC. Abiraterone acetate was used as a subsequent therapy in 13% of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 44% of patients on the placebo arm.  </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The primary efficacy analyses are supported by the following prospectively defined endpoints. The median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was 25.2 months for patients in the abiraterone acetate arm and 16.8 months for patients in the placebo arm (HR=0.580; 95%  CI: [0.487, 0.691], p &lt; 0.0001).<content styleCode="bold"> </content>

                  <paragraph>The median time to opiate use for prostate cancer pain was not reached for patients receiving abiraterone acetate and was 23.7 months for patients receiving placebo (HR=0.686; 95% CI: [0.566, 0.833], p=0.0001). The time to opiate use result was supported by a delay in patient reported pain progression favoring the abiraterone acetate arm.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">LATITUDE: Patients with metastatic high-risk CSPC </content>In LATITUDE (NCT01715285), 1199 patients with metastatic high-risk CSPC were randomized 1:1 to receive either abiraterone acetate orally at a dose of 1,000 mg once daily with prednisone 5 mg once daily (N=597) or placebos orally once daily (N=602). High-risk disease was defined as having at least two of three risk factors at baseline: a total Gleason score of ≥8, presence of ≥3 lesions on bone scan, and evidence of measurable visceral metastases. Patients with significant cardiac, adrenal, or hepatic dysfunction were excluded. Patients continued treatment until radiographic or clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal or death. Clinical progression was defined as the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation or surgical treatment for cancer, pain requiring chronic opioids, or ECOG performance status decline to ≥3. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patient demographics were balanced between the treatment arms. The median age was 67 years among all randomized subjects. The racial distribution of patients treated with abiraterone acetate was 69% Caucasian, 2.5% Black, 21% Asian, and 8.1% Other. The ECOG performance status was 0 for 55%, 1 for 42%, and 2 for 3.5% of patients. Baseline pain assessment was 0 to 1 (asymptomatic) in 50% of patients, 2 to 3 (mildly symptomatic) in 23% of patients, and ≥4 in 28% of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (worst pain over the last 24 hours). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A major efficacy outcome was overall survival. The pre-specified interim analysis after 406 deaths showed a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients on abiraterone acetate with prednisone compared to those on placebos. Twenty-one percent of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 41% of patients on the placebos arm received subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC. An updated survival analysis was conducted when 618 deaths were observed. The median follow-up time was 52 months. Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the pre-specified interim analysis (Table 10 and Figure 4). At the updated analysis, 29% of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 45% of patients on the placebos arm received subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC.</paragraph>
