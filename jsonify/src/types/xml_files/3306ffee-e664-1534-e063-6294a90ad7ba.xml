               <text>
                  <paragraph>The recommended dose of Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution is one 15 mcg unit-dose vial administered twice daily (morning and evening) by nebulization. A total daily dose of greater than 30 mcg (15 mcg twice daily) is not recommended.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should be administered by the orally inhaled route via a standard jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor (see the accompanying
 
  <content styleCode="bold">Patient Information</content>). Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should not be swallowed. Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should be stored refrigerated in foil pouches. After opening the pouch, unused unit-dose vials should be returned to, and stored in, the pouch. An opened unit-dose vial should be used right away.

 </paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>If the recommended maintenance treatment regimen fails to provide the usual response, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of destabilization of COPD. Under these circumstances, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options should be considered.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. However, since the clearance of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution is prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment, they should be monitored closely.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>The drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution have been established in clinical trials when administered using the PARI LC
 
  <sup>®</sup>Plus nebulizer (with a face mask or mouthpiece) and the PARI DURA NEB™ 3000 compressor. The safety and efficacy of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution delivered from non-compressor based nebulizer systems have not been established.

                        <paragraph>When beginning arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution, patients who have been taking inhaled short-acting beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonist and instruct the patient how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated. COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution no longer controls the symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient’s inhaled, short-acting beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a reevaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution beyond the recommended 15 mcg twice daily dose is not appropriate in this situation.

                        <paragraph>Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution, like other beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T-wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution, as with other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.

                        <paragraph>Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension; in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. In two pooled, 12-week, placebo-controlled trials investigating arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution doses of 15 mcg BID, 25 mcg BID, and 50 mcg QD, changes in mean predose and 2-hour post dose systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure were seen as a general fall of 2 to 4 mm/Hg; for pulse rate the mean of maximal increases were 8.8 to 12.0 beats/min. Over the course of a one-year study measuring serial electrocardiograms while receiving a dose of 50 mcg daily of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution resulted in an approximately 3.0 ms increase in QTC-F compared to the active comparator, salmeterol. Doses of the related beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.

                        <paragraph>In these trials, the overall frequency of all cardiovascular adverse events was 6.9% in arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 13.3% in the placebo group. There were no frequently occurring specific cardiovascular adverse events for arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution (frequency ≥1% and greater than placebo). The rate of COPD exacerbations was also comparable between the arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and placebo groups, 12.2% and 15.1%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was evaluated in one 52 week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, safety trial conducted in patients with moderate to severe COPD. The primary endpoint was time to either respiratory death or first COPD exacerbation-related hospitalization, whichever occurred first. The event had to be a death or hospitalization for which the patient’s respiratory status was predominant and/or inciting contributor, as determined by the clinical investigator. The objective of the trial was to demonstrate that the risk of respiratory death or COPD exacerbation-related hospitalization for patients treated with arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was not greater than 40% more than the risk for patient treated with placebo. A total of 841 patients (479 males and 361 females, ages 41 to 94 years old) with COPD were randomized: 420 to arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 421 to placebo. Of the randomized patients, 255 (61%) in the arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution group and 211 (50%) in the placebo group, completed one year of treatment. The trial objective was met demonstrating that COPD patients treated with arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution are not at an increased risk of respiratory death or COPD exacerbation-related hospitalizations compared to placebo.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution may inhibit the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta-agonists, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients. Therefore, patients with COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD. In this setting, cardio selective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Arformoterol tartrate should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Women should be advised to contact their physician if they become pregnant while taking arformoterol tartrate. In animal reproduction studies with arformoterol administered by the oral route to rats and rabbits at exposures approximately 370 and 8,400 times the adult exposure at the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID) of 15 mcg every 12 hours, respectively, there were findings of structural abnormalities, embryofetal and infant mortality, and alterations of growth. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when arformoterol was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No evidence of fetal harm was observed in rabbits at an exposure approximately 4,900 times the MRHDID.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In an embryofetal development study in which pregnant rats received doses of 1,000, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/kg/day from gestation days 6 to 17, arformoterol was shown to be teratogenic based upon findings of omphalocele (umbilical hernia), a malformation, in rat fetuses at exposures approximately 370 times adult exposure at the MRHDID (on an AUC basis with maternal oral doses of 1,000 mcg/kg/day and higher. Maternal toxicity was not observed in rats with exposures up to 2,400 times the MRHDID (on an AUC basis with maternal oral doses up to 10,000 mcg/kg/day). A no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for rat fetuses was not identified. In an embryofetal development study in which pregnant rabbits received doses of 20,000, 40,000 or 80,000 mcg/kg/day from gestation days 7 to 20, arformoterol was shown to be teratogenic based upon findings of malpositioned right kidney, a malformation, in rabbit fetuses at exposures approximately 8400 times and higher than the adult exposure at the MRHDID (on an AUC basis with maternal oral doses of 20,000 mcg/kg/day and higher). Malformations including brachydactyly, bulbous aorta, and liver cysts as well as decreased body weights were observed in rabbit fetuses at doses approximately 26,000 times and higher than the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with maternal oral doses of 40,000 mcg/kg/day and higher). Malformations including adactyly, lobular dysgenesis of the lung, and interventricular septal defect as well as embryolethality were observed in rabbit fetuses at a dose approximately 52,000 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with a maternal oral dose of 80,000 mcg/kg/day). Maternal toxicity was observed at doses approximately 26,000 times and higher than the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with maternal oral doses of 40,000 mcg/kg/day and higher). There was no evidence of fetal harm in rabbits at exposures approximately 4,900 times and lower than the adult exposure at the MRHDID (on an AUC basis with maternal oral doses of 10,000 mcg/kg/day and lower).

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In a pre- and post-natal development study, female rats received arformoterol at oral doses of 0, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 mcg/kg/day from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20. Lengths of gestation for female rats receiving doses 325 times and higher than the MRHDID (on a mcg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with maternal oral doses of 1,000 mcg/kg/day and higher) were slightly prolonged, which was attributed to prolonged parturition or dystocia due to the pharmacological action of β-adrenergic agonists such as arformoterol to relax uterine musculature. One female that had received a dose 3,200 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day) was euthanized due to complications during parturition. Pup survival and body weights were decreased at doses 1,600 times and higher than the MRHDID (on a mcg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with maternal oral doses of 5,000 mcg/kg/day and higher) at birth and during lactation. Umbilical hernia, a malformation, was observed for 1 pup at a dose 3,200 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day). Potential developmental delays of rat pups were observed at a dose 3,200 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis with a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day); however, no developmental delays were evident with doses 1,600 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m

                        <paragraph>Of the 873 patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution in two placebo-controlled clinical studies in adults with COPD, 391 (45%) were 65 years of age or older while 96 (11%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Among subjects age 65 years and older, 129 (33%) received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution at the recommended dose of 15 mcg twice daily, while the remainder received higher doses. ECG alerts for ventricular ectopy in patients 65 to ≤75 years of age were comparable among patients receiving 15 mcg twice daily, 25 mcg twice daily, and placebo (3.9%, 5.2%, and 7.1%, respectively). A higher frequency (12.4%) was observed when arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was dosed at 50 mcg once daily. The clinical significance of this finding is not known. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution is a sterile, clear, colorless, aqueous solution of the tartrate salt of arformoterol, the (R,R)-enantiomer of formoterol. Arformoterol is a selective beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic bronchodilator. The chemical name for arformoterol tartrate is formamide, N-[2-hydroxy-5-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-[[(1R)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methylethyl]amino]ethyl]phenyl]-, (2R,3R)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1:1 salt), and its established structural formula is as follows:

                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>The molecular weight of 
 
  <content styleCode="italics">arformoterol tartrate</content> is 494.5 g/mol, and its empirical formula is C

  <sub>6</sub> (1:1 salt). It is a white or off-white of light brown color powder that is soluble in dimethyl sulphoxide, slightly soluble in water and methanol, insoluble in ethyl acetate. Arformoterol tartrate is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) for (R,R)-formoterol L-tartrate.

 </paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution is supplied as 2 mL of arformoterol tartrate solution packaged in 3 mL unit-dose, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit-dose vials. Each unit-dose vial contains 15 mcg of arformoterol (equivalent to 22 mcg of arformoterol tartrate) in a sterile, isotonic saline solution, pH-adjusted between 4.7 and 5.3 with citric acid and trisodium citrate dihydrate.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution requires no dilution before administration by nebulization. Like all other nebulized treatments, the amount delivered to the lungs will depend upon patient factors, the nebulizer used, and compressor performance. Using the PARI LC
 
  <sup>®</sup> Plus nebulizer (with mouthpiece) connected to a PARI DURA NEB
 
  <sup>™</sup> 3000 compressor under 
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> conditions, the mean delivered dose from the mouthpiece (% nominal) was approximately 4.1 mcg (27.6%) at a mean flow rate of 3.3 L/min. The mean nebulization time was 6 minutes or less. Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should be administered from a standard jet nebulizer at adequate flow rates via face mask or mouthpiece.

 </paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Patients should be carefully instructed on the correct use of this drug product (please refer to the accompanying

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Arformoterol, the (R,R)-enantiomer of formoterol, is a selective long-acting beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist (beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonist) that has two-fold greater potency than racemic formoterol (which contains both the (S,S) and (R,R)-enantiomers). The (S,S)-enantiomer is about 1,000-fold less potent as a beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonist than the (R,R)-enantiomer. While it is recognized that beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta
 
  <sub>1</sub>-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, data indicate that there are also beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-agonists may have cardiac effects.

 </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacologic effects of beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including arformoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased intracellular cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.

                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>tests show that arformoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Arformoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these

The 24-hour Holter monitoring occurred once at baseline, and up to 3 times during the 12-week treatment period. The rates of new-onset cardiac arrhythmias not present at baseline over the double-blind 12-week treatment period were similar (approximately 33 to 34%) for patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily to those who received placebo. There was a dose-related increase in new, treatment-emergent arrhythmias seen in patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 25 mcg twice daily and 50 mcg once daily, 37.6% and 40.1%, respectively. The frequencies of new treatment-emergent events of non-sustained (3 to 10 beat run) and sustained (&gt;10 beat run) ventricular tachycardia were 7.4% and 1.1% in arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 6.9% and 1.0% in placebo. In patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 25 mcg twice daily and 50 mcg once daily, the frequencies of non-sustained (6.2% and 8.2%, respectively) and sustained ventricular tachycardia (1.0% and 1.0%, respectively) were similar. Five cases of ventricular tachycardia were reported as adverse events (1 in arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 4 in placebo), with two of these events leading to discontinuation of treatment (2 in placebo).</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>There were no baseline occurrences of atrial fibrillation/flutter observed on 24-hour Holter monitoring in patients treated with arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily or placebo. New, treatment-emergent atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in 0.4% of patients who received arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 0.3% of patients who received placebo. There was a dose-related increase in the frequency of atrial fibrillation/flutter reported in the arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 25 mcg twice daily and 50 mcg once daily dose groups of 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively. Two cases of atrial fibrillation/flutter were reported as adverse events (1 in arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily and 1 in placebo).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dose-related increases in mean maximum change in heart rate in the 12 hours after dosing were also observed following 12 weeks of dosing with arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily (8.8 bpm), 25 mcg twice daily (9.9 bpm) and 50 mcg once daily (12 bpm) versus placebo (8.5 bpm).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tolerance to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists can occur with regularly-scheduled, chronic use. In two placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with COPD involving approximately 725 patients in each, the overall efficacy of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was maintained throughout the 12-week trial duration. However, tolerance to the bronchodilator effect of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was observed after 6 weeks of dosing, as measured by a decrease in trough FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub>. FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub>improvement at the end of the 12-hour dosing interval decreased by approximately one-third (22.1% mean improvement after the first dose compared to 14.6% at week 12). Tolerance to the trough FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub>bronchodilator effect of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was not accompanied by other clinical manifestations of tolerance in these trials.

                        <paragraph>In COPD patients administered 15 mcg arformoterol every 12 hours for 14 days, the mean steady-state peak (R,R)-formoterol plasma concentration (C
 
  <sub>max</sub>) and systemic exposure (AUC
 
  <sub>0 to 12h</sub>) were 4.3 pg/mL and 34.5 pg•hr/mL, respectively. The median steady-state peak (R,R)- formoterol plasma concentration time (t

                        <paragraph>Systemic exposure to (R,R)-formoterol increased linearly with dose in COPD patients following arformoterol doses of 5 mcg, 15 mcg, or 25 mcg twice daily for 2 weeks or 15 mcg, 25 mcg, or 50 mcg once daily for 2 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In a crossover study in patients with COPD, when arformoterol 15 mcg inhalation solution and 12 and 24 mcg formoterol fumarate inhalation powder (Foradil
 
  <sup>®</sup>Aerolizer
 
  <sup>®</sup>) was administered twice daily for 2 weeks, the accumulation index was approximately 2.5 based on the plasma (R,R)-formoterol concentrations in all three treatments. At steady- state, geometric means of systemic exposure (AUC
 
  <sub>0 to 12h</sub>) to (R,R)-formoterol following 15 mcg of arformoterol inhalation solution and 12 mcg of formoterol fumarate inhalation powder were 39.33 pg•hr/mL and 33.93 pg•hr/mL, respectively (ratio 1.16; 90% CI 1.00, 1.35), while the geometric means of the C
 
  <sub>max</sub>were 4.30 pg/mL and 4.75 pg/mL, respectively (ratio 0.91; 90% CI 0.76, 1.09).

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In a study in patients with asthma, treatment with arformoterol 50 mcg with pre- and post-treatment with activated charcoal resulted in a geometric mean decrease in (R,R)-formoterol AUC
 
  <sub>0 to 6h</sub>by 27% and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>by 23% as compared to treatment with arformoterol 50 mcg alone. This suggests that a substantial portion of systemic drug exposure is due to pulmonary absorption.

                        <paragraph>Arformoterol is eliminated through the action of multiple drug metabolizing enzymes. Direct glucuronidation of arformoterol is mediated by several UGT enzymes and is the primary elimination route. O-Desmethylation is a secondary route catalyzed by the CYP enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. In otherwise healthy subjects with reduced CYP2D6 and/or UGT1A1 enzyme activity, there was no impact on systemic exposure to arformoterol compared to subjects with normal CYP2D6 and/or UGT1A1 enzyme activities.

                        <paragraph>In animal studies investigating its cardiovascular effects, arformoterol induced dose-dependent increases in heart rate and decreases in blood pressure consistent with its pharmacology as a beta-adrenergic agonist. In dogs, at systemic exposures higher than anticipated clinically, arformoterol also induced exaggerated pharmacologic effects of a beta-adrenergic agonist on cardiac function as measured by electrocardiogram (sinus tachycardia, atrial premature beats, ventricular escape beats, PVCs).</paragraph>

                     <title>14.1 Adult COPD Trials</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution was studied in two identical, 12-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, randomized, multi-center, parallel group trials conducted in the United States (Clinical Trial A and Clinical Trial B). A total of 1,456 adult patients (age range: 34 to 89 years; mean age: 63 years; gender: 860 males and 596 females) with COPD who had a mean FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub>of 1.3 L (42% of predicted) were enrolled in the two clinical trials. The racial/ethnic distribution in these two trials included 1383 Caucasians, 49 Blacks, 10 Asians, and 10 Hispanics, and 4 patients classified as Other. The diagnosis of COPD was based on a prior clinical diagnosis of COPD, a smoking history (greater than 15 pack-years), age (at least 35 years), spirometry results (baseline FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub>  ≤65% of predicted value and &gt;0.70 L, and a FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub>/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio ≤70%). About 80% of patients in these studies had bronchodilator reversibility, defined as a 10% or greater increase in FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub>after inhalation of 2 actuations (180 mcg racemic albuterol from a metered dose inhaler). Both trials compared arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily (288 patients), 25 mcg twice daily (292 patients), 50 mcg once daily (293 patients) with placebo (293 subjects). Both trials included salmeterol inhalation aerosol, 42 mcg twice daily as an active comparator (290 patients).

 </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In both 12-week trials, arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily resulted in a statistically significant change of approximately 11% in mean FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub> (as measured by percent change from study baseline FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub> at the end of the dosing interval over the 12 weeks of treatment, the primary efficacy endpoint) compared to placebo. Compared to arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily, arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 25 mcg twice daily and 50 mcg once daily did not provide sufficient additional benefit on a variety of endpoints, including FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub>, to support the use of higher doses. Plots of the mean change in FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub> values obtained over the 12 hours after dosing for the arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution 15 mcg twice daily dose group and for the placebo group are provided in Figures 1 and 2 for Clinical Trial A, below. The plots include mean FEV
 
  <sub>1</sub> change observed after the first dose and after 12 weeks of treatment. The results from Clinical Trial B were similar.
