                        <paragraph> Ticagrelor has been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (includingÂ the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y<sub>12</sub>-receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patientâs serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor interference, ticagrelor is not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other haemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from case reports with ticagrelor use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Ticagrelor given to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during organogenesis caused structural abnormalities in the offspring at maternal doses about 5 to 7 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area. When ticagrelor was given to rats during late gestation and lactation, pup death and effects on pup growth were seen at approximately 10 times the MRHD (<content styleCode="italics">see Data</content>). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In reproductive toxicology studies, pregnant rats received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 20 to 300 mg/kg/day. 20 mg/kg/day is approximately the same as the MRHD of 90 mg twice daily for a 60 kg human on a mg/m<sup>2Â </sup>basis. Adverse outcomes in offspring occurred at doses of 300 mg/kg/day (16.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2Â </sup>basis) and included supernumerary liver lobe and ribs, incomplete ossification of sternebrae, displaced articulation of pelvis, and misshapen/misaligned sternebrae. At the mid-dose of 100 mg/kg/day (5.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2Â </sup>basis), delayed development of liver and skeleton was seen.When pregnant rabbits received ticagrelor during organogenesis at doses from 21 to 63 mg/kg/day, fetuses exposed to the highest maternal dose of 63 mg/kg/day (6.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2Â </sup>basis) had delayed gall bladder development and incomplete ossification of the hyoid, pubis and sternebrae occurred. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a prenatal/postnatal study, pregnant rats received ticagrelor at doses of 10 to 180 mg/kg/day during late gestation and lactation. Pup death and effects on pup growth were observed at 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2Â </sup>basis). Relatively minor effects such as delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening occurred at doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg (approximately one-half and 3.2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2Â </sup>basis). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) by ticagrelor and clopidogrel was compared in a 6-week study examining both acute and chronic platelet inhibition effects in response to 20 Î¼M ADP as the platelet aggregation agonist. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The onset of IPA was evaluated on Day 1 of the study following loading doses of 180 mg ticagrelor or 600 mg clopidogrel. As shown in Figure 5, IPA was higher in the ticagrelor group at all time points. The maximum IPA effect of ticagrelor was reached at around 2 hours, and was maintained for at least 8 hours. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The offset of IPA was examined after 6 weeks on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily, again in response to 20 Î¼M ADP. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As shown in Figure 6, mean maximum IPA following the last dose of ticagrelor was 88% and 62% for clopidogrel. The insert in Figure 6 shows that after 24 hours, IPA in the ticagrelor group (58%) was similar to IPA in clopidogrel group (52%), indicating that patients who miss a dose of ticagrelor would still maintain IPA similar to the trough IPA of patients treated with clopidogrel. After 5 days, IPA in the ticagrelor group was similar to IPA in the placebo group. It is not known how either bleeding risk or thrombotic risk track with IPA, for either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

                        <paragraph>PLATO (NCT00391872)Â was a randomized double-blind study comparing ticagrelor (N=9333) to clopidogrel (N=9291), both given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), who presented within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms. The studyâs primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI), or non-fatal stroke. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients who had already been treated with clopidogrel could be enrolled and randomized to either study treatment. Patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. Patients could be included whether there was intent to manage the ACS medically or invasively, but patient randomization was not stratified by this intent. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients randomized to ticagrelor received a loading dose of 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily. Patients in the clopidogrel arm were treated with an initial loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg, if clopidogrel therapy had not already been given. Patients undergoing PCI could receive an additional 300 mg of clopidogrel at investigator discretion. A daily maintenance dose of aspirin 75 to 100 mg was recommended, but higher maintenance doses of aspirin were allowed according to local judgment. Patients were treated for at least 6 months and for up to 12 months. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>PLATO patients were predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (92%). About 43% of patients were &gt;65 years and 15% were &gt;75 years. Median exposure to study drug was 276 days. About half of the patients received pre-study clopidogrel and about 99% of the patients received aspirin at some time during PLATO. About 35% of patients were receiving a statin at baseline and 93% received a statin sometime during PLATO.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 7 shows the study results for the primary composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary endpoint. Separate secondary endpoint analyses are shown for the overall occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke and overall mortality.Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Among 11,289 patients with PCI receiving any stent during PLATO, there was a lower risk of stent thrombosis (1.3% for adjudicated âdefiniteâ) than with clopidogrel (1.9%) (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.91; p=0.009). The results were similar for drug-eluting and bare metal stents.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A wide range of demographic, concurrent baseline medications, and other treatment differences were examined for their influence on outcome. Some of these are shown in Figure 11. Such analyses must be interpreted cautiously, as differences can reflect the play of chance among a large number of analyses. Most of the analyses show effects consistent with the overall results, but there are two exceptions: a finding of heterogeneity by region and a strong influence of the maintenance dose of aspirin. These are considered further below.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Most of the characteristics shown are baseline characteristics, but some reflect post-randomization determinations (e.g., aspirin maintenance dose, use of PCI). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Results in the rest of the world compared to effects in North America (U.S. and Canada) show a smaller effect in North America, numerically inferior to the control and driven by the U.S. subset. The statistical test for the U.S./non-U.S. comparison is statistically significant (<content styleCode="italics">p</content>=0.009), and the same trend is present for both CV death and non-fatal MI. The individual results and nominal <content styleCode="italics">p</content>-values, like all subset analyses, need cautious interpretation, and they could represent chance findings. The consistency of the differences in both the CV mortality and non-fatal MI components, however, supports the possibility that the finding is reliable. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A wide variety of baseline and procedural differences between the U.S. and non-U.S. (including intended invasive vs. planned medical management, use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, use of drug eluting vs. bare-metal stents) were examined to see if they could account for regional differences, but with one exception, aspirin maintenance dose, these differences did not appear to lead to differences in outcome.

                        <paragraph>The PLATO protocol left the choice of aspirin maintenance dose up to the investigator and use patterns were different in U.S. sites from sites outside of the U.S. About 8% of non-U.S. investigators administered aspirin doses above 100 mg, and about 2% administered doses above 300 mg.Â In the U.S., 57% of patients received doses above 100 mg and 54% received doses above 300 mg. Overall results favored ticagrelor when used with low maintenance doses (â¤100 mg) of aspirin, and results analyzed by aspirin dose were similar in the U.S. and elsewhere. Figure 10 shows overall results by median aspirin dose. Figure 12 shows results by region and dose.Â  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Like any unplanned subset analysis, especially one where the characteristic is not a true baseline characteristic (but may be determined by usual investigator practice), the above analyses must be treated with caution. It is notable, however, that aspirin dose predicts outcome in both regions with a similar pattern, and that the pattern is similar for the two major components of the primary endpoint, CV death and non-fatal MI. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Despite the need to treat such results cautiously, there appears to be good reason to restrict aspirin maintenance dosage accompanying ticagrelor to 100 mg. Higher doses do not have an established benefit in the ACS setting, and there is a strong suggestion that use of such doses reduces the effectiveness of ticagrelor. Â </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The PEGASUS TIMI-54 study (NCT01225562)Â was a 21,162-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two doses of ticagrelor, either 90 mg twice daily or 60 mg twice daily, co-administered with 75 to 150 mg of aspirin, were compared to aspirin therapy alone in patients with history of MI. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. CV death and all-cause mortality were assessed as secondary endpoints. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were eligible to participate if they were â¥50 years old, with a history of MI 1 to 3 years prior to randomization, and had at least one of the following risk factors for thrombotic cardiovascular events: age â¥65 years, diabetes mellitus requiring medication, at least one other prior MI, evidence of multivessel coronary artery disease, or creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min. Patients could be randomized regardless of their prior ADP receptor blocker therapy or a lapse in therapy. Patients requiring or who were expected to require renal dialysis during the study were excluded. Patients with any previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, or with known bleeding diathesis or coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants were excluded from participating and patients who developed an indication for anticoagulation during the trial were discontinued from study drug. A small number of patients with a history of stroke were included. Based on information external to PEGASUS, 102 patients with a history of stroke (90 of whom received study drug) were terminated early and no further such patients were enrolled. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were treated for at least 12 months and up to 48 months with a median follow up time of 33 months. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were predominantly male (76%) Caucasian (87%) with a mean age of 65 years, and 99.8% of patients received prior aspirin therapy. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Both the 60 mg and 90 mg regimens of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin were superior to aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI or stroke. The absolute risk reductions for ticagrelor plus aspirin vs. aspirin alone were 1.27% and 1.19% for the 60 and 90 mg regimens, respectively.

                        <paragraph>The THEMIS study (NCT01991795) was a double-blind, parallel group, study in which 19,220 patients with CAD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) but no history of MI or stroke were randomized to twice daily ticagrelor or placebo, on a background of 75 to 150 mg of aspirin. The primary endpoint was the composite of first occurrence of CV death, MI, and stroke. CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, and all-cause death were assessed as secondary endpoints. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were eligible to participate if they were â¥ 50 years old with CAD, defined as a history of PCI or CABG, or angiographic evidence of â¥ 50% lumen stenosis of at least 1 coronary artery and T2DM treated for at least 6 months with glucose-lowering medication. Patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 6 months, known bleeding diathesis, and coagulation disorder were excluded. Patients taking anticoagulants or ADP receptor antagonists were excluded from participating, and patients who developed an indication for those medications during the trial were discontinued from study drug. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were treated for a median of 33 months and up to 58 months. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were predominantly male (69%) with a mean age of 66 years. At baseline, 80% had a history of coronary artery revascularization; 58% had undergone PCI, 29% had undergone a CABG and 7% had undergone both. The proportion of patients studied in the U.S. was 12%. Patients in THEMIS had established CAD and other risk factors that put them at higher cardiovascular risk. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV death, MI, or stroke. The effect on the composite endpoint was driven by the individual components MI and stroke; see Table 9. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were eligible to participate if they were â¥40 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score â¤5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD<sup>2Â </sup>score â¥6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis â¥50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300 to 325 mg then 75 to 100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ticagrelor was superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR). </paragraph>
