                              <paragraph>There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient's 24-hour hydromorphone hydrochloride dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In general, it is safest to start hydromorphone hydrochloride therapy by administering half of the usual starting dose every 3 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution; and every 4 to 6 hours for hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. The dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride can be gradually adjusted until adequate pain relief and acceptable side effects have been achieved <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.5">Dosage and Administration (2.5)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <title>2.7 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Oral Solution or Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Tablets</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid dependent patient taking hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.14">Warnings and Precautions (5.14)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S9.3">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, hydromorphone hydrochloride exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S9">Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, and reassess all patients receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions.  Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.2">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended.  Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S10">Overdosage (10)</linkHtml>]</content>. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets are essential <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2">Dosage and Administration (2)</linkHtml>]</content>.  Overestimating the hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Accidental ingestion of even one dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of hydromorphone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.7">Dosage and Administration (2.7)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone.  Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S7">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use.  In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate then on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.2">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S5.3">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S10">Overdosage (10)</linkHtml>].</content>

Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.7">Dosage and Administration (2.7)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S5.14">Warnings and Precautions (5.14)</linkHtml>]</content>.</content>

                        <paragraph>Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure.  If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids.  Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers.  Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious adverse reactions associated with hydromorphone hydrochloride include respiratory depression and apnea and, to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse effects are lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. These effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. </paragraph>

An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate.  Opioid analgesics, including hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions.  However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor.  Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to 17 via oral gavage doses of 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day (0.4, 2, or 4 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively).  Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in the two highest dose groups).  There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Pregnant rabbits were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to 19 via oral gavage doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day (8.1, 20.3, or 40.5 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively).  Maternal toxicity was noted in the two highest dose groups (reduced food consumption and body weights).  There was no evidence of malformations or embryotoxicity reported.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In a published study, neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) were noted following subcutaneous administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride (19 to 258 mg/kg) on Gestation Day 8 to pregnant hamsters (6.4 to 87.2 times the HDD of 24 mg/day based on body surface area).  The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity.  No neural tube defects were noted at 14 mg/kg (4.7 times the human daily dose of 24 mg/day).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In a published study, CF-1 mice were treated subcutaneously with continuous infusion of 7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg/day hydromorphone hydrochloride (1.5, 3, or 6.1 times the human daily dose of 24 mg based on body surface area) via implanted osmotic pumps during organogenesis (Gestation Days 7 to 10).  Soft tissue malformations (cryptorchidism, cleft palate, malformed ventricles and retina), and skeletal variations (split supraoccipital, checkerboard and split sternebrae, delayed ossification of the paws and ectopic ossification sites) were observed at doses 3 times the human dose of 24 mg/day based on body surface area.  The findings cannot be clearly attributed to maternal toxicity.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Increased pup mortality and decreased pup body weights were noted at 0.8 and 2 times the human daily dose of 24 mg in a study in which pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 7 to Lactation Day 20 via oral gavage doses of 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mg/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, or 2 times the HDD of 24 mg based on body surface area, respectively).  Maternal toxicity (decreased food consumption and body weight gain) was also noted at the two highest doses tested.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to hydromorphone.  In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of hydromorphone hydrochloride slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.8">Warnings and Precautions (5.8)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hydromorphone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets contain hydromorphone, a substance with high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misuse and abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of hydromorphone hydrochloride with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of hydromorphone hydrochloride abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing hydromorphone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use hydromorphone hydrochloride in combination with other abused drugs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>"Drug-seeking" behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When discontinuing hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution and hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.7">Dosage and Administration (2.7)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S2.7">Warnings and Precautions (5.14)</linkHtml>].</content>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In case of overdose, priorities are the reestablishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed.  Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydromorphone in hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution or hydromorphone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's prescribing information. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Hydromorphone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses.  The principal therapeutic action of hydromorphone is analgesia.  Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with morphine.  Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown.  However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Hydromorphone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers.

                              <paragraph>Hydromorphone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum.  Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</paragraph>

The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.  Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The analgesic activity of hydromorphone hydrochloride is due to the parent drug, hydromorphone. Hydromorphone is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Exposure of hydromorphone (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-24</sub>) is dose-proportional at a dose range of 2 and 8 mg. <content styleCode="italics">In vivo</content> bioavailability following single-dose administration of the 8 mg tablet is approximately 24% (coefficient of variation 21%). Bioequivalence between the hydromorphone hydrochloride 8 mg tablet and an equivalent dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride oral solution has been demonstrated.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>After oral administration of hydromorphone hydrochloride, peak plasma hydromorphone concentrations are generally attained within ½ to 1 hour.</paragraph>

Due to increased exposure of hydromorphone, patients with moderate hepatic impairment should be started at a lower dose and closely monitored during dose titration. Pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in severe hepatic impairment patients has not been studied. Further increase in C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of hydromorphone in this group is expected. As such, starting dose should be even more conservative <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S8.6">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
