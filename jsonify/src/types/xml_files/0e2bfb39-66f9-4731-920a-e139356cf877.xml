                              <paragraph>PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. Although no confirmed cases of PML were identified in UPLIZNA clinical trials, JC virus infection resulting in PML has been observed in patients treated with other B-cell depleting antibodies and other therapies that affect immune competence. In UPLIZNA clinical trials one subject died following the development of new brain lesions for which a definitive diagnosis could not be established, though the differential diagnosis included an atypical NMOSD relapse, PML, or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold UPLIZNA and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>UPLIZNA is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody and immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of UPLIZNA in pregnant women. However, transient peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in infants born to mothers exposed to other B-cell depleting antibodies during pregnancy. B-cell levels in infants following maternal exposure to UPLIZNA have not been studied in clinical trials. The potential duration of B-cell depletion in such infants, and the impact of B-cell depletion on vaccine safety and effectiveness, is unknown <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>].</content>

                              <paragraph>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism by which inebilizumab-cdon exerts its therapeutic effects in NMOSD and IgG4-RD is unknown but is presumed to involve binding to CD19, a cell surface antigen presents on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. Following cell surface binding to B lymphocytes, inebilizumab-cdon results in antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pharmacodynamics of UPLIZNA were assessed with an assay for CD20+ B-cells, since UPLIZNA can interfere with the CD19+ B-cell assay. Treatment with UPLIZNA reduces CD20+ B-cell counts in blood by 8 days after infusion. In Study 1 <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S14.1">Clinical Studies (14.1)</linkHtml>]</content>, CD20+ B-cell counts were reduced below the lower limit of normal by 4 weeks in 100% of patients treated with UPLIZNA and remained below the lower limit of normal in 94% of patients for 28 weeks after initiation of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study 2 <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S14.2">Clinical Studies (14.2)</linkHtml>
                           </content>], CD20+ B-cell counts were reduced below the lower limit of normal by week 2 in 100% of patients treated with UPLIZNA and remained below the lower limit of normal in 85% of patients for up to 52 weeks after initiation of treatment.</paragraph>

At low exposure levels, inebilizumab-cdon was likely subject to the receptor (CD19)-mediated clearance, which decreased with time presumably because of the depletion of B-cells by UPLIZNA treatment.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of UPLIZNA.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study 1, treatment-emergent antibodies (those that appeared or significantly increased from baseline after administration of UPLIZNA), were detected in 5.6% patients receiving UPLIZNA. Although these data do not demonstrate an impact of anti-inebilizumab-cdon antibody development on the efficacy or safety of UPLIZNA in these patients, the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study 2, the incidence of treatment-emergent anti-inebilizumab-cdon antibodies was 8.8% (6/68) of patients receiving UPLIZNA during the 52-week RCP. Neutralizing antibodies were not directly assessed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the treatment periods for Study 1 and Study 2, there was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-inebilizumab-cdon antibodies on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety or effectiveness of UPLIZNA.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of UPLIZNA for the treatment of NMOSD was established in Study 1 (NCT02200770), a randomized (3:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 213 patients with NMOSD who were anti-AQP4 antibody positive and 17 who were anti-AQP4 antibody negative.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients met the following eligibility criteria:</paragraph>
                        <list styleCode="arabic" listType="ordered">
                           <item>A history of one or more relapses that required rescue therapy within the year prior to screening, or 2 or more relapses that required rescue therapy in 2 years prior to screening.</item>
                           <item>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 7.5 or less. Patients with an EDSS score of 8.0 were eligible if they were deemed capable of participating.</item>
                           <item>Patients were excluded if previously treated with immunosuppressant therapies within an interval specified for each such therapy.</item>
                        </list>
                        <paragraph>The use of immunosuppressants during the blinded phase of the trial was prohibited.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The use of oral or intravenous corticosteroids during the blinded phase of the trial was prohibited, with the exception of premedication for investigational treatment and treatment for a relapse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the 213 enrolled anti-AQP4 antibody positive patients, a total of 161 were randomized to receive treatment with UPLIZNA, and 52 were randomized to receive placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. Females accounted for 94% of the study population. Fifty-two percent of patients were White, 21% Asian, and 9% Black or African American. The mean age was 43 years (range 18 to 74 years). The mean EDSS score was 4.0. The number of relapses in the two years prior to randomization was 2 or more in 83% of the patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>UPLIZNA was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen <content styleCode="italics">[</content>see <content styleCode="italics">

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All potential relapses were evaluated by a blinded, independent, adjudication committee, who determined whether the relapse met protocol-defined criteria. Patients who experienced an adjudicated relapse in the randomized-controlled period (RCP), or who completed the Day 197 visit without a relapse, exited the RCP.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to the onset of the first adjudicated relapse on or before Day 197.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The time to the first adjudicated relapse was significantly longer in patients treated with UPLIZNA compared to patients who received placebo (relative risk reduction 73%; hazard ratio: 0.272; p &lt; 0.0001). In the anti-AQP4 antibody positive population there was a 77.3% relative reduction (hazard ratio: 0.227, p &lt; 0.0001). There was no evidence of a benefit in patients who were anti-AQP4 antibody negative.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of UPLIZNA for the treatment of IgG4-RD was established in Study 2 (NCT04540497), a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 52-week placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 135 adult patients who met the following eligibility criteria:</paragraph>
                        <list styleCode="disc" listType="unordered">
                           <item>Newly diagnosed or recurrent IgG4-RD that required glucocorticoid (GC) treatment at screening.</item>
                           <item>Confirmed history of organ involvement at any time in the course of disease.</item>
                        </list>
                        <paragraph>The concomitant use of biologic and non-biologic immunosuppressive agents was prohibited during the blinded phase of the trial. Of the 135 enrolled IgG4-RD patients, 68 patients were randomized to receive UPLIZNA and 67 were randomized to receive placebo. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment groups. Females accounted for 35% of the study population. Thirty-nine percent of patients were White, 47% Asian, and 1% Black or African American. The mean age was 58 years (range 24 to 80 years). The median disease duration was 0.9 years. Forty-six percent of patients were newly diagnosed with IgG4-RD and 54% had recurrent disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were at a uniform 20 mg per day dose of glucocorticoids at the time of randomization and then began a prespecified taper of 5 mg dose every two weeks until discontinuation at the end of 8 weeks. The use of glucocorticoids during the trial was permitted for premedication for investigational treatment, treatment for a relapse and in certain situations other than an IgG4-RD flare. UPLIZNA was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.4">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Disease flare was defined as new/worsening signs or symptoms that were positively adjudicated and warranted treatment by the investigator. All potential flares were assessed by the investigator and subsequently reviewed by a blinded, independent, adjudication committee, who determined whether the flare met one or more of the protocol-defined, organ-specific flare diagnostic criteria.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to First Treated and Adjudication Committee (AC)-determined IgG4-RD flare within the 52-week RCP. The time to the First Treated and AC determined IgG4-RD flare was significantly longer in the UPLIZNA group, compared with the placebo group (Figure 2). UPLIZNA reduced the risk of treated and AC-determined IgG4-RD flare by 87%, compared with placebo (hazard ratio: 0.13; p &lt; 0.0001) (see <linkHtml href="#table6">Table 6</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
