                        <paragraph>Bortezomib for injection treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory; however, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Patients with pre-existing symptoms (numbness, pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy (including ≥Grade 3) during treatment with bortezomib for injection. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness. In the Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma trial comparing bortezomib subcutaneous vs intravenous, the incidence of Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy was 24% for subcutaneous and 39% for intravenous. Grade ≥3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 15% in the intravenous treatment group<content styleCode="italics"> [see Adverse Reactions (</content>

In the bortezomib vs dexamethasone Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma study, improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 48% of patients with ≥Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy following dose adjustment or interruption. Improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 73% of patients who discontinued due to Grade 2 neuropathy or who had ≥Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the Phase 2 multiple myeloma studies. The long-term outcome of peripheral neuropathy has not been studied in mantle cell lymphoma. </paragraph>

Bortezomib was administered intravenously at doses of 1.3 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>twice weekly for two out of three weeks (21 day cycle). After eight 21 day cycles patients continued therapy for three, 35 day cycles on a weekly schedule. Duration of treatment was up to 11 cycles (nine months) with a median duration of six cycles (4.1 months). For inclusion in the trial, patients must have had measurable disease and one to three prior therapies. There was no upper age limit for entry. Creatinine clearance could be as low as 20 mL/min and bilirubin levels as high as 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was similar in men and women, and in patients &lt;65 and ≥65 years of age.

                        <paragraph>Among the 331 bortezomib-treated patients, the most commonly reported (&gt;20%) adverse reactions overall were nausea (52%), diarrhea (52%), fatigue (39%), peripheral neuropathies (35%), thrombocytopenia (33%), constipation (30%), vomiting (29%), and anorexia (21%). The most commonly reported (&gt;20%) adverse reaction reported among the 332 patients in the dexamethasone group was fatigue (25%). Eight percent (8%) of patients in the bortezomib-treated arm experienced a Grade 4 adverse reaction; the most common reactions were thrombocytopenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%). Nine percent (9%) of dexamethasone-treated patients experienced a Grade 4 adverse reaction. All individual dexamethasone-related Grade 4 adverse reactions were less than 1%.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Serious adverse reactions are defined as any reaction that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongs a current hospitalization, results in a significant disability, or is deemed to be an important medical event. A total of 80 (24%) patients from the bortezomib treatment arm experienced a serious adverse reaction during the study, as did 83 (25%) dexamethasone-treated patients. The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions in the bortezomib treatment arm were diarrhea (3%), dehydration, herpes zoster, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia (2% each). In the dexamethasone treatment group, the most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4%), hyperglycemia (3%), pyrexia, and psychotic disorder (2% each).</paragraph>

Among the 331 bortezomib-treated patients, the most commonly reported adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (8%). Among the 332 patients in the dexamethasone group, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were psychotic disorder and hyperglycemia (2% each). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Four deaths were considered to be bortezomib-related in this relapsed multiple myeloma study: one case each of cardiogenic shock, respiratory insufficiency, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrest.

                        <paragraph>In general, safety data were similar for the subcutaneous and intravenous treatment groups. Differences were observed in the rates of some Grade ≥3 adverse reactions. Differences of ≥5% were reported in neuralgia (3% subcutaneous vs 9% intravenous), peripheral neuropathies (6% subcutaneous vs 15% intravenous), neutropenia (13% subcutaneous vs 18% intravenous), and thrombocytopenia (8% subcutaneous vs 16% intravenous). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> A local reaction was reported in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous group, mostly redness. Only two (1%) patients were reported as having severe reactions, one case of pruritus and one case of redness. Local reactions led to reduction in injection concentration in one patient and drug discontinuation in one patient. Local reactions resolved in a median of six days. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dose reductions occurred due to adverse reactions in 31% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group compared with 43% of the intravenously-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction included peripheral sensory neuropathy (17% in the subcutaneous treatment group compared with 31% in the intravenous treatment group); and neuralgia (11% in the subcutaneous treatment group compared with 19% in the intravenous treatment group). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The incidence of serious adverse reactions was similar for the subcutaneous treatment group (20%) and the intravenous treatment group (19%). The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions in the subcutaneous treatment arm were pneumonia and pyrexia (2% each). In the intravenous treatment group, the most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, diarrhea, and peripheral sensory neuropathy (3% each). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the subcutaneous treatment group, 27 patients (18%) discontinued study treatment due to an adverse reaction compared with 17 patients (23%) in the intravenous treatment group. Among the 147 subcutaneously-treated patients, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were peripheral sensory neuropathy (5%) and neuralgia (5%). Among the 74 patients in the intravenous treatment group, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were peripheral sensory neuropathy (9%) and neuralgia (9%). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two patients (1%) in the subcutaneous treatment group and one (1%) patient in the intravenous treatment group died due to an adverse reaction during treatment. In the subcutaneous group the causes of death were one case of pneumonia and one case of sudden death. In the intravenous group the cause of death was coronary artery insufficiency. </paragraph>

This analysis does not include data from the Phase 3 open-label study of bortezomib subcutaneous vs intravenous in relapsed multiple myeloma. In the integrated studies, the safety profile of bortezomib was similar in patients with multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the integrated analysis, the most commonly reported (&gt;20%) adverse reactions were nausea (49%), diarrhea (46%), asthenic conditions including fatigue (41%) and weakness (11%), peripheral neuropathies (38%), thrombocytopenia (32%), vomiting (28%), constipation (25%), and pyrexia (21%). Eleven percent (11%) of patients experienced at least one episode of ≥Grade 4 toxicity, most commonly thrombocytopenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the Phase 2 relapsed multiple myeloma clinical trials of bortezomib administered intravenously, local skin irritation was reported in 5% of patients, but extravasation of bortezomib was not associated with tissue damage.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The activity and safety of bortezomib in combination with intensive reinduction chemotherapy was evaluated in pediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell ALL 77%, 16% with T-cell ALL, and 7% T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL)), all of whom relapsed within 36 months of initial diagnosis in a single-arm multicenter, nonrandomized cooperative group trial. An effective reinduction multiagent chemotherapy regimen was administered in three blocks. Block 1 included vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin and pegaspargase; Block 2 included cyclophosphamide, etoposide and methotrexate; Block 3 included high-dose cytosine arabinoside and asparaginase. Bortezomib was administered at a dose of 1.3 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>as a bolus intravenous injection on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of Block 1 and Days 1, 4, and 8 of Block 2. There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety. The median age was ten years (range: 1 to 26), 57% were male, 70% were white, 14% were black, 4% were Asian, 2% were American Indian/Alaska Native, 1% were Pacific Islander. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The activity was evaluated in a prespecified subset of the first 60 evaluable patients enrolled on the study with pre-B ALL ≤21 years and relapsed &lt;36 months from diagnosis. The complete remission (CR) rate at day 36 was compared to that in a historical control set of patients who had received the identical backbone therapy without bortezomib. There was no evidence that the addition of bortezomib had any impact on the CR rate. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No new safety concerns were observed when bortezomib was added to a chemotherapy backbone regimen as compared with a historical control group in which the backbone regimen was given without bortezomib.</paragraph>

In the event of an overdosage, the patient's vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies in monkeys and dogs showed that intravenous bortezomib doses as low as two times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis were associated with increases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension, and death. In dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed at doses resulting in death. In monkeys, doses of 3.0 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>and greater (approximately twice the recommended clinical dose) resulted in hypotension starting at one hour postadministration, with progression to death in 12 to 14 hours following drug administration.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types<content styleCode="italics"> in vitro</content>. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth<content styleCode="italics"> in vivo </content>in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Studies in monkeys showed that administration of dosages approximately twice the recommended clinical dose resulted in heart rate elevations, followed by profound progressive hypotension, bradycardia, and death 12 to 14 hours postdose. Doses ≥1.2 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>induced dose-proportional changes in cardiac parameters. Bortezomib has been shown to distribute to most tissues in the body, including the myocardium. In a repeated dosing toxicity study in the monkey, myocardial hemorrhage, inflammation, and necrosis were also observed.</paragraph>

Neurotoxic effects of bortezomib in animal studies included axonal swelling and degeneration in peripheral nerves, dorsal spinal roots, and tracts of the spinal cord. Additionally, multifocal hemorrhage and necrosis in the brain, eye, and heart were observed. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A prospective, international, randomized (1:1), open-label clinical study (NCT00111319) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether bortezomib administered intravenously (1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and prednisone (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) resulted in improvement in time to progression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and prednisone (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered for a maximum of nine cycles (approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Antiviral prophylaxis was recommended for patients on the bortezomib study arm. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years (48;91), 50% were male, 88% were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80 (60;100). Patients had IgG/IgA/Light chain myeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median hemoglobin of 105 g/L (64;165), and a median platelet count of 221,500/microliter (33,000;587,000). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy results for the trial are presented in <content styleCode="italics">Table 14</content>. At a prespecified interim analysis (with median follow-up of 16.3 months), the combination of bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone therapy resulted in significantly superior results for time to progression, progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate. Further enrollment was halted, and patients receiving melphalan and prednisone were offered bortezomib in addition. A later, prespecified analysis of overall survival (with median follow-up of 36.7 months with a hazard ratio of 0.65, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.84) resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit for the bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone treatment arm despite subsequent therapies including bortezomib based regimens. In an updated analysis of overall survival based on 387 deaths (median follow-up 60.1 months), the median overall survival for the bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone treatment arm was 56.4 months and for the melphalan and prednisone treatment arm was 43.1 months, with a hazard ratio of 0.695 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.85). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A prospective Phase 3, international, randomized (1:1), stratified, open-label clinical study (NCT00048230) enrolling 669 patients was designed to determine whether bortezomib resulted in improvement in time to progression (TTP) compared to high-dose dexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma following 1 to 3 prior therapies. Patients considered to be refractory to prior high-dose dexamethasone were excluded as were those with baseline Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy or platelet counts &lt;50,000/µL. A total of 627 patients were evaluable for response. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Stratification factors were based on the number of lines of prior therapy the patient had previously received (one previous line vs more than one line of therapy), time of progression relative to prior treatment (progression during or within six months of stopping their most recent therapy vs relapse &gt;6 months after receiving their most recent therapy), and screening beta<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin levels (≤2.5 mg/L vs &gt;2.5 mg/L). </paragraph>

Within each five week treatment cycle, dexamethasone 40 mg/day PO was administered once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 followed by a 15 day rest period (Days 21 to 35). Within each four week treatment cycle, dexamethasone 40 mg/day PO was administered once daily on Days 1 to 4 followed by a 24 day rest period (Days 5 to 28). Patients with documented progressive disease on dexamethasone were offered bortezomib at a standard dose and schedule on a companion study. Following a preplanned interim analysis of time to progression, the dexamethasone arm was halted and all patients randomized to dexamethasone were offered bortezomib, regardless of disease status. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the bortezomib arm, 34% of patients received at least one bortezomib dose in all eight of the three week cycles of therapy, and 13% received at least one dose in all 11 cycles. The average number of bortezomib doses during the study was 22, with a range of 1 to 44. In the dexamethasone arm, 40% of patients received at least one dose in all four of the five week treatment cycles of therapy, and 6% received at least one dose in all nine cycles. </paragraph>

Response and progression were assessed using the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. Complete response (CR) required &lt;5% plasma cells in the marrow, 100% reduction in M-protein, and a negative immunofixation test (IF<sup>-</sup>). Partial response (PR) requires ≥50% reduction in serum myeloma protein and ≥90% reduction of urine myeloma protein on at least two occasions for a minimum of at least six weeks along with stable bone disease and normal calcium. Near complete response (nCR) was defined as meeting all the criteria for complete response including 100% reduction in M-protein by protein electrophoresis; however, M-protein was still detectable by immunofixation (IF<sup>+</sup>).</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An open-label, randomized, Phase 3 noninferiority study (NCT00722566) compared the efficacy and safety of the subcutaneous administration of bortezomib vs the intravenous administration. This study included 222 bortezomib naïve patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 1.3 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of bortezomib by either the subcutaneous (n=148) or intravenous (n=74) route for eight cycles. Patients who did not obtain an optimal response (less than Complete Response (CR)) to therapy with bortezomib alone after four cycles were allowed to receive oral dexamethasone 20 mg daily on the day of and after bortezomib administration (82 patients in subcutaneous treatment group and 39 patients in the intravenous treatment group). Patients with baseline Grade ≥2 peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain, or platelet counts &lt;50,000/µL were excluded. A total of 218 patients were evaluable for response. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Stratification factors were based on the number of lines of prior therapy the patient had received (one previous line vs more than one line of therapy), and international staging system (ISS) stage (incorporating beta<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin and albumin levels; Stages I, II, or III). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The baseline demographic and other characteristics of the two treatment groups are summarized as follows: the median age of the patient population was approximately 64 years of age (range: 38 to 88 years), primarily male (subcutaneous: 50%, intravenous: 64%); the primary type of myeloma is IgG (subcutaneous: 65% IgG, 26% IgA, 8% light chain; intravenous: 72% IgG, 19% IgA, 8% light chain), ISS staging I/II/III (%) was 27, 41, 32 for both subcutaneous and intravenous, Karnofsky performance status score was ≤70% in 22% of subcutaneous and 16% of intravenous, creatinine clearance was 67.5 mL/min in subcutaneous and 73 mL/min in intravenous, the median years from diagnosis was 2.68 and 2.93 in subcutaneous and intravenous respectively and the proportion of patients with more than one prior line of therapy was 38% in subcutaneous and 35% in intravenous. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>This study met its primary (noninferiority) objective that single agent subcutaneous bortezomib retains at least 60% of the overall response rate after four cycles relative to single agent intravenous bortezomib.

                        <paragraph>A single-arm, open-label trial (NCT00431769) was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of retreatment with bortezomib. One hundred and thirty patients (≥18 years of age) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a bortezomib-containing regimen (median of two prior lines of therapy [range: 1 to 7]) were retreated upon progression with bortezomib administered intravenously. Patients were excluded from trial participation if they had peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain of Grade ≥2. At least six months after prior bortezomib therapy, bortezomib was restarted at the last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>(n=93) or ≤1 mg/m<sup>2</sup>(n=37) and given on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every three weeks for maximum of eight cycles either as single agent or in combination with dexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care. Dexamethasone was administered in combination with bortezomib to 83 patients in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving dexamethasone during the course of bortezomib retreatment cycles. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. Fifty of the 130 patients achieved a best confirmed response of Partial Response or better for an overall response rate of 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, 47.4). One patient achieved a Complete Response and 49 achieved Partial Response. In the 50 responding patients, the median duration of response was 6.5 months and the range was 0.6 to 19.3 months.</paragraph>

This clinical study utilized independent pathology confirmation and independent radiologic response assessment. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients in the VcR-CAP treatment arm received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) administered intravenously on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 (rest period Days 12 to 21); rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on Day 1; cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on Day 1; doxorubicin (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on Day 1; and prednisone (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on Day 1 through Day 5 of the 21 day treatment cycle. For patients with a response first documented at Cycle 6, two additional treatment cycles were allowed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and 32% were Asian. Sixty-nine percent of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow biopsy for MCL, 54% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of three (high-intermediate) or higher and 76% had Stage IV disease. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The majority of the patients in both groups received six or more cycles of treatment, 84% in the VcR-CAP group and 83% in the R-CHOP group. Median number of cycles received by patients in both treatment arms was six with 17% of patients in the R-CHOP group and 14% of subjects in the VcR-CAP group receiving up to two additional cycles. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy results for PFS, CR and ORR with a median follow-up of 40 months are presented in <content styleCode="italics">Table 18</content>. The response criteria used to assess efficacy were based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (IWRC).

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma were evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study (NCT00063713) of 155 patients with progressive disease who had received at least one prior therapy. The median age of the patients was 65 years (42, 89), 81% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. Of the total, 75% had one or more extra-nodal sites of disease, and 77% were Stage 4. In 91% of the patients, prior therapy included all of the following: an anthracycline or mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. A total of thirty-seven percent (37%) of patients were refractory to their last prior therapy. An intravenous bolus injection of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose was administered twice weekly for two weeks on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 followed by a ten day rest period (Days 12 to 21) for a maximum of 17 treatment cycles.
