                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with roflumilast tablets is associated with an increase in psychiatric adverse reactions. In 8 controlled clinical trials 5.9% (263) of patients treated with roflumilast tablets 500 mcg daily reported psychiatric adverse reactions compared to 3.3% (137) treated with placebo. The most commonly reported psychiatric adverse reactions were insomnia, anxiety, and depression which were reported at higher rates in those treated with roflumilast tablets 500 mcg daily (2.4%, 1.4%, and 1.2% for roflumilast tablets versus 1.0%, 0.9%, and 0.9% for placebo, respectively)<content styleCode="italics"> [see <linkHtml href="#Section_6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. Instances of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in clinical trials. Three patients experienced suicide-related adverse reactions (one completed suicide and two suicide attempts) while receiving roflumilast tablets compared to one patient (suicidal ideation) who received placebo. One patient completed suicide while receiving roflumilast tablets in Trial 9 <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_14.1">Clinical Studies (14.1)</linkHtml>]</content>, which assessed the effect of adding roflumilast to a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of ICS/LABA on rates of exacerbations in COPD patients over 1 year of treatment. Cases of suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide, have been observed in the post-marketing setting in patients with or without a history of depression.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Before using roflumilast tablets in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behavior, prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with roflumilast tablets in such patients. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of insomnia, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with roflumilast tablets if such events occur.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Weight loss was a common adverse reaction in roflumilast tablets clinical trials and was reported in 7.5% (331) of patients treated with roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once daily compared to 2.1% (89) treated with placebo <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. In addition to being reported as adverse reactions, weight was prospectively assessed in two placebo-controlled clinical trials of one year duration. In these studies, 20% of patients receiving roflumilast experienced moderate weight loss (defined as between 5 to 10% of body weight) compared to 7% of patients who received placebo. In addition, 7% of patients who received roflumilast compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo experienced severe (greater than 10% body weight) weight loss. During follow-up after treatment discontinuation, the majority of patients with weight loss regained some of the weight they had lost while receiving roflumilast tablets. Patients treated with roflumilast tablets should have their weight monitored regularly. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, weight loss should be evaluated, and discontinuation of roflumilast tablets should be considered.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A major step in roflumilast metabolism is the N-oxidation of roflumilast to roflumilast N-oxide by CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. The administration of the cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer rifampicin resulted in a reduction in exposure, which may result in a decrease in the therapeutic effectiveness of roflumilast tablets. Therefore, the use of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin) with roflumilast tablets is not recommended <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_7.1">Drug Interactions (7.1)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#Section_12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>].</content>

                        <paragraph>The safety data described below reflect exposure of 4438 patients to roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once daily in four 1year placebo-controlled trials, two 6-month placebo-controlled trials, and two 6-month drug add-on trials <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_14.1">Clinical Studies (14.1)</linkHtml>].</content> In these trials, 3136 and 1232 COPD patients were exposed to roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once daily for 6 months and 1 year, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The population had a median age of 64 years (range 40 to 91), 73% were male, 92.9% were Caucasian, and had COPD with a mean pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 8.9 to 89.1% predicted. In these trials, 68.5% of the patients treated with roflumilast tablets reported an adverse reaction compared with 65.3% treated with placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reaction was 14.8% for roflumilast tablets -treated patients and 9.9% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of roflumilast tablets were diarrhea (2.4%) and nausea (1.6%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious adverse reactions, whether considered drug-related or not by the investigators, which occurred more frequently in roflumilast tablets-treated patients include diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, prostate cancer, acute pancreatitis, and acute renal failure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reports of roflumilast tablets received worldwide and have not been listed elsewhere. These adverse reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of seriousness, frequency of reporting or potential causal connection to roflumilast tablets. Because these adverse reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to roflumilast tablets exposure: hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema, urticaria, and rash), gynecomastia.</paragraph>

                           </content>There are no randomized clinical studies of roflumilast tablets in pregnant women. In animal reproductive toxicity studies, roflumilast tablets administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no fetal structural abnormalities. The highest roflumilast tablets dose in these studies was approximately 30 and 26 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Roflumilast tablets induced post-implantation loss in rats at doses greater than or equal to approximately 10 times the MRHD. Roflumilast tablets induced stillbirth and decreased pup viability in mice at doses corresponding to approximately 16 and 49 times, respectively, the MRHD. Roflumilast tablets has been shown to adversely affect pup post-natal development when dams were treated with the drug during pregnancy and lactation periods in mice at doses corresponding to 49 times the MRHD <content styleCode="italics">(see Data).<br/>

                        <paragraph>Roflumilast and its active metabolite (roflumilast N-oxide) are selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4). Roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide inhibition of PDE4 (a major cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-metabolizing enzyme in lung tissue) activity leads to accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP. While the specific mechanism(s) by which roflumilast tablets exerts its therapeutic action in COPD patients is not well defined, it is thought to be related to the effects of increased intracellular cyclic AMP in lung cells.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In COPD patients, 4-week treatment with roflumilast tablets 500 mcg oral once daily reduced sputum neutrophils and eosinophils by 31%, and 42%, respectively. In a pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers, roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once daily reduced the number of total cells, neutrophils and eosinophils found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following segmental pulmonary lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge by 35%, 38% and 73%, respectively. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</paragraph>

                           </content>The absolute bioavailability of roflumilast following a 500 mcg oral dose is approximately 80%. Maximum plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) of roflumilast typically occur approximately one hour after dosing (ranging from 0.5 to 2 hours) in the fasted state while plateau-like maximum concentrations of the N-oxide metabolite are reached in approximately eight hours (ranging from 4 to 13 hours). Food has no effect on total drug absorption, but delays time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of roflumilast by one hour and reduces C<sub>max</sub> by approximately 40%, however, C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> of roflumilast N-oxide are unaffected. An in vitro study showed that roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide did not inhibit P-gp transporter. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Distribution <br/>
                           </content>Plasma protein binding of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite is approximately 99% and 97%, respectively. Volume of distribution for single-dose 500 mcg roflumilast is about 2.9 L/kg. Studies in rats with radiolabeled roflumilast indicate low penetration across the blood-brain barrier.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Metabolism <br/>
                           </content>Roflumilast is extensively metabolized via Phase I (cytochrome P450) and Phase II (conjugation) reactions. The N-oxide metabolite is the only major metabolite observed in the plasma of humans. Together, roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide account for the majority (87.5%) of total dose administered in plasma. In urine, roflumilast was not detectable while roflumilast N-oxide was only a trace metabolite (less than 1%). Other conjugated metabolites such as roflumilast N-oxide glucuronide and 4-amino-3,5-dichloropyridine N-oxide were detected in urine. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While roflumilast is three times more potent than roflumilast N-oxide at inhibition of the PDE4 enzyme <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>, the plasma AUC of roflumilast N-oxide on average is about 10-fold greater than the plasma AUC of roflumilast. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies and clinical drug-drug interaction studies suggest that the biotransformation of roflumilast to its N-oxide metabolite is mediated by CYP1A2 and 3A4. Based on further in vitro results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of roflumilast and roflumilast N-oxide do not inhibit CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4/5, or 4A9/11. Therefore, there is a low probability of relevant interactions with substances metabolized by these P450 enzymes. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrated no induction of the CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4/5 and only a weak induction of CYP2B6 by roflumilast. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Elimination <br/>
                           </content>The plasma clearance after short-term intravenous infusion of roflumilast is on average about 9.6 L/h. Following an oral dose, the median plasma effective half-life of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite are approximately 17 and 30 hours, respectively. Steady state plasma concentrations of roflumilast and its N-oxide metabolite are reached after approximately 4 days for roflumilast and 6 days for roflumilast N-oxide following once-daily dosing. Following intravenous or oral administration of radiolabeled roflumilast, about 70% of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term studies were conducted in hamsters and mice with roflumilast to evaluate its carcinogenic potential. In 2-year oral gavage carcinogenicity studies, roflumilast treatment resulted in dose-related, statistically significant increases in the incidence of undifferentiated carcinomas of nasal epithelium in hamsters at ≥8 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of roflumilast and its metabolites). The tumorigenicity of roflumilast appears to be attributed to a reactive metabolite of 4-amino-3,5- dichloropyridine N-oxide (ADCP N-oxide). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in mice at roflumilast oral doses up to 12 and 18 mg/kg/day in females and males, respectively (approximately 10 and 15 times the MRHD, respectively, based on summed AUCs of roflumilast and its metabolites).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Roflumilast tested positive in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test, but negative in the following assays: Ames test for bacterial gene mutation, in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes, in vitro HPRT test with V79 cells, an in vitro micronucleus test with V79 cells, DNA adduct formation assay in rat nasal mucosa, liver and testes, and in vivo mouse bone marrow chromosome aberration assay. Roflumilast N-oxide was negative in the Ames test and in vitro micronucleus test with V79 cells.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a human spermatogenesis study, roflumilast 500 mcg had no effects on semen parameters or reproductive hormones during the 3-month treatment period and the following 3-month off-treatment period. In a fertility study, roflumilast decreased fertility rates in male rats at 1.8 mg/kg/day (approximately 29 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). The male rats also showed increases in the incidence of tubular atrophy, degeneration in the testis and spermiogenic granuloma in the epididymides. No effect on rat fertility rate or male reproductive organ morphology was observed at 0.6 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). In a female fertility study, no effect on fertility was observed up to the highest roflumilast dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day in rats (approximately 24 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of roflumilast tablets in COPD was evaluated in 8 randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group clinical trials in 9394 adult patients (4425 receiving roflumilast tablets 500 mcg) 40 years of age and older with COPD. Of the 8 trials, two were placebo-controlled dose selection trials (Trials 1 and 2) of 6 months' duration that evaluated the efficacy of roflumilast tablets 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily, four were placebo-controlled 1-year trials (Trials 3, 4, 5, and 6) primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of roflumilast tablets on COPD exacerbations, and two were 6-month efficacy trials (Trials 7 and 8) which assessed the effect of roflumilast tablets as add-on therapy to a long-acting beta agonist or long-acting anti-muscarinic. The 8 trials enrolled patients with nonreversible obstructive lung disease (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ≤70% and ≤12% or 200 mL improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> in response to 4 puffs of albuterol/salbutamol) but the severity of airflow obstruction at baseline was different among the trials. Patients enrolled in the dose selection trials had the full range of COPD severity (FEV<sub>1</sub> 30-80% predicted); median age of 63 years, 73% male, and 99% Caucasian. Patients enrolled in the four exacerbation trials had severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> ≤50% predicted); median age of 64 years, 74% male, and 90% Caucasian.<br/>
                           <br/> Patients enrolled in the two 6-month efficacy trials had moderate to severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> 40-70% predicted); median age of 65 years, 68% male, and 97% Caucasian. COPD exacerbations and lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) were co-primary efficacy outcome measures in the four 1-year trials. In the two 6-month supportive efficacy trials, lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) alone was the primary efficacy outcome measure. <br/>
                           <br/>The two 6-month dose-selection efficacy trials (Trials 1 and 2) explored doses of 250 mcg and 500 mcg once daily in a total of 1929 patients (751 and 724 on roflumilast tablets 250 mcg and 500 mcg, respectively). The selection of the 500 mcg dose was primarily based on nominal improvements in lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>) over the 250 mcg dose. The once-daily dosing regimen was primarily based on the determination of a plasma half-life of 17 hours for roflumilast and 30 hours for its active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide <content styleCode="italics">
                              <content styleCode="underline">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3</linkHtml>)</content>]</content>.<br/>
                           <br/> An additional placebo-controlled 1-year trial (Trial 9) evaluated the effect of roflumilast tablets 500 mcg on COPD exacerbations when added to a fixed-dose combination (FDC) product containing an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA). At screening, patients were required to have two or more exacerbations in the previous year. This trial randomized a total of 2354 patients (1178 randomized to roflumilast tablets, 1176 to placebo). Approximately 60% of the patients enrolled had severe COPD (postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> 30% to 50% of predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis and 39% had very severe COPD (postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> ≤ 30% of predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis; mean age of 64 years, 69% male, and 80% Caucasian. The use of long-acting muscarinic antagonists was allowed. </paragraph>

                           <br/> The effect of roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once daily on COPD exacerbations was evaluated in five 1-year trials (Trials 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two of the trials (Trials 3 and 4) conducted initially enrolled a population of patients with severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> ≤50% of predicted) inclusive of those with chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema who had a history of smoking of at least 10 pack years. Inhaled corticosteroids were allowed as concomitant medications and used in 61% of both roflumilast tablets and placebo-treated patients and short-acting beta agonists were allowed as rescue therapy. The use of long-acting beta agonists, long-acting anti-muscarinics, and theophylline were prohibited. The rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations was a co-primary endpoint in both trials. There was not a symptomatic definition of exacerbation in these 2 trials. Exacerbations were defined in terms of severity requiring treatment with a moderate exacerbation defined as treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids in Trial 3 or systemic glucocorticosteroids and/or antibiotics in Trial 4 and a severe exacerbation defined as requiring hospitalizations and/or leading to death in Trial 3 or requiring hospitalization in Trial 4. The trials randomized 1176 patients (567 on roflumilast tablets) in Trial 3 and 1514 patients (760 on roflumilast tablets) in Trial 4. Both trials failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the rate of COPD exacerbations. <br/>
                           <br/> Exploratory analyses of the results of Trials 3 and 4 identified a subpopulation of patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and COPD exacerbations within the previous year that appeared to demonstrate a better response in the reduction of the rate of COPD exacerbations compared to the overall population. As a result, two subsequent trials (Trial 5 and Trial 6) were conducted that enrolled patients with severe COPD but associated with chronic bronchitis, at least one COPD exacerbation in the previous year, and at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. In these trials, long-acting beta agonists and short-acting antimuscarinics were allowed and were used by 44% and 35% of patients treated with roflumilast tablets and 45% and 37% of patients treated with placebo, respectively. The use of inhaled corticosteroids was prohibited. As in trials 3 and 4, the rate of moderate exacerbations (defined as requiring intervention with systemic glucocorticosteroids) or severe exacerbations (defined as leading to hospitalization and/or to death) was a co-primary endpoint.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Trial 5 randomized a total of 1525 patients (765 on roflumilast tablets) and Trial 6 randomized a total of 1571 patients (772 on roflumilast tablets). In both trials, roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once daily demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations compared to placebo (Table 2). These two trials provide the evidence to support the use of roflumilast tablets for the reduction of COPD exacerbations.<br/>

                        <paragraph> 1. Effect measured as difference between roflumilast tablets and placebo treated patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lung function was also evaluated in two 6-month trials (Trials 7 and 8) to assess the effect of roflumilast tablets when administered as add-on therapy to treatment with a long-acting beta agonist or a long-acting anti-muscarinic. These trials were conducted in a different population of COPD patients [moderate to severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> 40 to 70% of predicted) without a requirement for chronic bronchitis or frequent history of exacerbations] from that for which efficacy in reduction of exacerbations has been demonstrated and provide safety support to the roflumilast tablets COPD program. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The tolerability of roflumilast tablets was evaluated in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in patients with severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis (Trial 10). At screening, patients were required to have had at least one exacerbation in the previous year. A total of 1323 patients were randomized to receive roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once a day for 12 weeks (n=443), roflumilast tablets 500 mcg every other day for 4 weeks followed by roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once a day for 8 weeks (n=439), or roflumilast tablets 250 mcg once a day for 4 weeks followed by roflumilast tablets 500 mcg once a day for 8 weeks (n=441). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Over the 12 week study period, the percentage of patients discontinuing treatment was 6.2% lower in patients initially receiving roflumilast tablets 250 mcg daily for 4 weeks followed by roflumilast tablets 500 mcg daily for 8 weeks (18.4%) compared to those receiving roflumilast tablets 500 mcg daily for 12 weeks (24.6%) (Odds Ratio = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.93; p=0.017). Because this trial was limited to 12 weeks in duration, whether initiation of dosing with roflumilast tablets 250 mcg improves the long term tolerability of roflumilast tablets 500 mcg has not been determined.</paragraph>
