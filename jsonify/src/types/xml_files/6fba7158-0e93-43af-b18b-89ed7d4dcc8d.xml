                        <paragraph>Adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older: 2 oral inhalations twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The maximum recommended dosage is 2 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg twice daily.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">General Dosing Recommendation</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When choosing the starting dosage strength of ADVAIR HFA, consider the patients’ disease severity, based on their previous asthma therapy, including the ICS dosage, as well as the patients’ current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist should be used for immediate relief.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of ADVAIR HFA can occur within 30 minutes of beginning treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, replacing the current strength of ADVAIR HFA with a higher strength may provide additional improvement in asthma control.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of ADVAIR HFA with a higher strength, adding additional ICS, initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 2 inhalations twice daily) of the prescribed strength of ADVAIR HFA is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses of salmeterol. Patients using ADVAIR HFA should not use additional LABA for any reason. <content styleCode="italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_0881320b-1823-4b3f-be9e-9d9d22393abc">5.3</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#i4i_section_id_29c36b96-344e-43eb-b710-616e3b3cfddc">5.12</linkHtml>).]</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Use of LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death <content styleCode="italics">[see Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)]</content>. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone <content styleCode="italics">(see Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic Agonists)</content>.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic Agonists</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Four (4) large, 26-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical safety trials were conducted to evaluate the risk of serious asthma-related events when LABA were used in fixed‑dose combination with ICS compared with ICS alone in subjects with asthma. Three (3) trials included adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older: 1 trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder, 1 trial compared mometasone furoate/formoterol with mometasone furoate, and 1 trial compared budesonide/formoterol with budesonide. The fourth trial included pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years and compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder. The primary safety endpoint for all 4 trials was serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death). A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma related.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The 3 adult and adolescent trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the 3 adult and adolescent trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>ADVAIR HFA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma. ADVAIR HFA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma. The initiation of ADVAIR HFA in this setting is not appropriate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol, a component of ADVAIR HFA, has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function). However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of ADVAIR HFA with a higher strength, adding additional ICS, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 2 inhalations twice daily of ADVAIR HFA.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ADVAIR HFA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. ADVAIR HFA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When beginning treatment with ADVAIR HFA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>ADVAIR HFA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using ADVAIR HFA should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, have been reported in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) following the inhaled administration of corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate and ADVAIR DISKUS. In 2 replicate 1-year trials in 1,579 subjects with COPD, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia reported in subjects receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 250 mcg/50 mcg (7%) than in those receiving salmeterol 50 mcg (3%). The incidence of pneumonia in the subjects treated with ADVAIR DISKUS was higher in subjects older than 65 years (9%) compared with the incidence in subjects younger than 65 years (4%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 3-year trial in 6,184 subjects with COPD, there was a higher incidence of pneumonia reported in subjects receiving ADVAIR DISKUS 500 mcg/50 mcg compared with placebo (16% with ADVAIR DISKUS 500 mcg/50 mcg, 14% with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, 11% with salmeterol 50 mcg, and 9% with placebo). Similar to what was seen in the 1-year trials with ADVAIR DISKUS 250 mcg/50 mcg, the incidence of pneumonia was higher in subjects older than 65 years (18% with ADVAIR DISKUS 500 mcg/50 mcg versus 10% with placebo) compared with subjects younger than 65 years (14% with ADVAIR DISKUS 500 mcg/50 mcg versus 8% with placebo).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ICS should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although ADVAIR HFA may control asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to ADVAIR HFA. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with ADVAIR HFA. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.8 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate, a component of ADVAIR HFA, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of ADVAIR HFA in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing ADVAIR HFA.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of ICS in sensitive patients, patients treated with ADVAIR HFA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</paragraph>

Therefore, ADVAIR HFA, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Salmeterol, a component of ADVAIR HFA, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.</paragraph>

Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other ICS in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The incidence of adverse reactions associated with ADVAIR HFA in Table 2 is based upon two 12-week, placebo-controlled, U.S. clinical trials (Trials 1 and 3) and 1 active-controlled 12-week U.S. clinical trial (Trial 2). A total of 1,008 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma (556 females and 452 males) previously treated with albuterol alone, salmeterol, or ICS were treated twice daily with 2 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg or ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg, fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol (44- or 110-mcg doses), salmeterol CFC inhalation aerosol 21 mcg, or placebo HFA inhalation aerosol. The average duration of exposure was 71 to 81 days in the active treatment groups compared with 51 days in the placebo group.</paragraph>

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to ADVAIR, fluticasone propionate, and/or salmeterol or a combination of these factors.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of ADVAIR HFA, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are insufficient data on the use of ADVAIR HFA or individual monoproducts, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate, in pregnant women. There are clinical considerations with the use of ADVAIR HFA in pregnant women. <content styleCode="italics">(See Clinical Considerations.)</content> In animals, teratogenicity characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits, was observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. <content styleCode="italics">(See Data.)</content> However, fluticasone propionate administered via inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. <content styleCode="italics">(See Data.)</content> Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. Oral administration of salmeterol to pregnant rabbits caused teratogenicity characteristic of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation at maternal doses approximately 25 times the MRHDID on an AUC basis. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when salmeterol was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No such effects occurred at an oral salmeterol dose approximately 10 times the MRHDID. <content styleCode="italics">(See Data.)</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of ADVAIR HFA have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older. Use of ADVAIR HFA in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from thirty-eight (38) subjects aged 12 to 17 years were treated with ADVAIR HFA in U.S. pivotal clinical trials. Subjects in this age group demonstrated efficacy results similar to those observed in subjects aged 18 years and older. There were no obvious differences in the type or frequency of adverse events reported in this age group compared with subjects aged 18 years and older. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 12-week trial, the safety of ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg given as 2 inhalations twice daily was compared with that of fluticasone propionate 44 mcg HFA (FLOVENT HFA) 2 inhalations twice daily in 350 subjects aged 4 to 11 years with persistent asthma currently being treated with ICS. No new safety concerns were observed in children aged 4 to 11 years treated for 12 weeks with ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg compared with adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. Common adverse reactions (≥3%) seen in children aged 4 to 11 years treated with ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg but not reported in the adult and adolescent clinical trials of ADVAIR HFA include: pyrexia, cough, pharyngolaryngeal pain, rhinitis, and sinusitis <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>. This trial was not designed to assess the effect of salmeterol, a component of ADVAIR HFA, on asthma hospitalizations and death in subjects aged 4 to 11 years. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effect on serum cortisol of 21 days of treatment with ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg (2 inhalations twice daily with or without a spacer) or ADVAIR DISKUS 100 mcg/50 mcg (1 inhalation twice daily) was evaluated in a trial of 31 children aged 4 to 11 years with mild asthma. Systemic exposure to salmeterol xinafoate was similar for ADVAIR HFA, ADVAIR HFA delivered with a spacer, and ADVAIR DISKUS while the systemic exposure to fluticasone propionate was lower with ADVAIR HFA compared with that of ADVAIR HFA delivered with a spacer or ADVAIR DISKUS. There were reductions in serum cortisol from baseline in all treatment groups (14%, 22%, and 13% for ADVAIR HFA, ADVAIR HFA delivered with a spacer, and ADVAIR DISKUS, respectively) <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>ICS, including fluticasone propionate, a component of ADVAIR HFA, may cause a reduction in growth velocity in children and adolescents <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]</content>. The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ADVAIR HFA, should be monitored. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A 52-week placebo-controlled trial to assess the potential growth effects of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT ROTADISK) at 50 and 100 mcg twice daily was conducted in the U.S. in 325 prepubescent children (244 males and 81 females) aged 4 to 11 years. The mean growth velocities at 52 weeks observed in the intent-to-treat population were 6.32 cm/year in the placebo group (n = 76), 6.07 cm/year in the 50-mcg group (n = 98), and 5.66 cm/year in the 100-mcg group (n = 89). An imbalance in the proportion of children entering puberty between groups and a higher dropout rate in the placebo group due to poorly controlled asthma may be confounding factors in interpreting these data. A separate subset analysis of children who remained prepubertal during the trial revealed growth rates at 52 weeks of 6.10 cm/year in the placebo group (n = 57), 5.91 cm/year in the 50-mcg group (n = 74), and 5.67 cm/year in the 100-mcg group (n = 79). In children aged 8.5 years, the mean age of children in this trial, the range for expected growth velocity is: boys – 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile = 3.8 cm/year, 50<sup>th</sup> percentile = 5.4 cm/year, and 97<sup>th</sup> percentile = 7.0 cm/year; girls – 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile = 4.2 cm/year, 50<sup>th</sup> percentile = 5.7 cm/year, and 97<sup>th</sup> percentile = 7.3 cm/year. The clinical relevance of these growth data is not certain. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a child or adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that he/she is particularly sensitive to this effect of corticosteroids should be considered. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ADVAIR HFA, each patient should be titrated to the lowest strength that effectively controls his/her asthma <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of ADVAIR HFA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether older subjects respond differently than younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In addition, as with other products containing beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists, special caution should be observed when using ADVAIR HFA in geriatric patients who have concomitant cardiovascular disease that could be adversely affected by beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>No human overdosage data has been reported for ADVAIR HFA.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>ADVAIR HFA contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to ADVAIR HFA. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of ADVAIR HFA together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg, ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg, and ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg are combinations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>One active component of ADVAIR HFA is fluticasone propionate, a corticosteroid having the chemical name <content styleCode="italics">S-</content>(fluoromethyl) 6α,9-difluoro-11β,17-dihydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17β-carbothioate, 17-propionate and the following chemical structure:</paragraph>
                  <renderMultiMedia ID="id2140296043" referencedObject="ID_7b7eb55e-7212-49e9-b353-b4759013869f"/>
                  <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 500.6, and the empirical formula is C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>31</sub>F<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>S. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide, and slightly soluble in methanol and 95% ethanol.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The other active component of ADVAIR HFA is salmeterol xinafoate, a beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic bronchodilator. Salmeterol xinafoate is the racemic form of the 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid salt of salmeterol. It has the chemical name 4-hydroxy-α<sup>1</sup>-[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyl]-1,3-benzenedimethanol, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylate and the following chemical structure:</paragraph>
                  <renderMultiMedia ID="id-61027990" referencedObject="B87C11F3-EBFD-4195-84BB-85AA87F2A3F8"/>
                  <paragraph>Salmeterol xinafoate is a white powder with a molecular weight of 603.8, and the empirical formula is C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>37</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>•C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. It is freely soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and isopropanol; and sparingly soluble in water.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>ADVAIR HFA is a purple plastic inhaler with a light purple cap containing a pressurized metered-dose aerosol canister fitted with a counter. Each canister contains a microcrystalline suspension of micronized fluticasone propionate and micronized salmeterol xinafoate in propellant HFA-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). It contains no other excipients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After priming, each actuation of the inhaler delivers 50, 125, or 250 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 25 mcg of salmeterol in 75 mg of suspension from the valve. Each actuation delivers 45, 115, or 230 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 21 mcg of salmeterol from the actuator. Twenty-one micrograms (21 mcg) of salmeterol base is equivalent to 30.45 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate. The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as the coordination between the actuation of the inhaler and inspiration through the delivery system.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prime ADVAIR HFA before using for the first time by releasing 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well for 5 seconds before each spray. In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 4 weeks or when it has been dropped, prime the inhaler again by releasing 2 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well for 5 seconds before each spray. Avoid spraying in eyes.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>ADVAIR HFA contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to ADVAIR HFA. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices of asthma.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Fluticasone Propionate</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Salmeterol Xinafoate</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta<sub>2</sub>‑adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists may have cardiac effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacologic effects of beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>, from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor–induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Healthy Subjects: Cardiovascular Effects:</content> Since systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol are not normally seen at the therapeutic dose, higher doses were used to produce measurable effects. Four (4) placebo-controlled crossover trials were conducted with healthy subjects: (1) a cumulative-dose trial using 42 to 336 mcg of salmeterol CFC inhalation aerosol given alone or as ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg, (2) a single-dose trial using 4 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg, salmeterol CFC inhalation aerosol 21 mcg, or fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 220 mcg, (3) a single-dose trial using 8 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg, ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg, or ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg, and (4) a single-dose trial using 4 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg; 2 inhalations of ADVAIR DISKUS 500 mcg/50 mcg; 4 inhalations of fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 220 mcg; or 1,010 mcg of fluticasone propionate given intravenously. In these trials pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, glucose, and/or potassium were measured. Comparable or lower effects were observed for ADVAIR HFA compared with ADVAIR DISKUS or salmeterol alone. The effect of salmeterol on pulse rate and potassium was not altered by the presence of different amounts of fluticasone propionate in ADVAIR HFA.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects:</content> The potential effect of salmeterol on the effects of fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis was also evaluated in 3 of these trials. Compared with fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol, ADVAIR HFA had less effect on 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion and less or comparable effect on 24-hour serum cortisol. In these crossover trials in healthy subjects, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS had similar effects on urinary and serum cortisol.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Subjects with Asthma: Cardiovascular Effects:</content> In clinical trials with ADVAIR HFA in adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older with asthma, systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) were similar to or slightly lower in patients treated with ADVAIR HFA compared with patients treated with salmeterol CFC inhalation aerosol 21 mcg. In 61 adult and adolescent subjects with asthma given ADVAIR HFA (45 mcg/21 mcg or 115 mcg/21 mcg), continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after the first dose and after 12 weeks of twice-daily therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effect of 21 days of treatment with ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg (2 inhalations twice daily with or without a spacer) or ADVAIR DISKUS 100 mcg/50 mcg (1 inhalation twice daily) was evaluated in 31 children aged 4 to 11 years with mild asthma. There were no notable changes from baseline for QTc, heart rate, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Effects:</content> A 4-way crossover trial in 13 subjects with asthma compared pharmacodynamics at steady state following 4 weeks of twice-daily treatment with 2 inhalations of ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg, 1 inhalation of ADVAIR DISKUS 250 mcg/50 mcg, 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate HFA inhalation aerosol 110 mcg, and placebo. No significant differences in serum cortisol AUC were observed between active treatments and placebo. Mean 12-hour serum cortisol AUC ratios comparing active treatment with placebo ranged from 0.9 to 1.2. No statistically or clinically significant increases in heart rate or QTc interval were observed for any active treatment compared with placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 12-week trial in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma, ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg was compared with the individual components, fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 110 mcg and salmeterol CFC inhalation aerosol 21 mcg, and placebo <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</content>. All treatments were administered as 2 inhalations twice daily. After 12 weeks of treatment with these therapeutic doses, the geometric mean ratio of urinary cortisol excretion compared with baseline was 0.9 for ADVAIR HFA and fluticasone propionate and 1.0 for placebo and salmeterol. In addition, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation in 23 to 32 subjects per treatment group, remained intact for the majority of subjects and was similar across treatments. Three (3) subjects who received ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol &lt;18 mcg/dL) after dosing, compared with 1 subject who received placebo, 2 subjects who received fluticasone propionate 110 mcg, and 1 subject who received salmeterol.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In another 12-week trial in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma, ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg (2 inhalations twice daily) was compared with ADVAIR DISKUS 500 mcg/50 mcg (1 inhalation twice daily) and fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol 220 mcg (2 inhalations twice daily) <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</content>. The geometric mean ratio of 24‑hour urinary cortisol excretion at week 12 compared with baseline was 0.9 for all 3 treatment groups.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effect of 21 days of treatment with ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg (2 inhalations twice daily with or without a spacer) or ADVAIR DISKUS 100 mcg/50 mcg (1 inhalation twice daily) on serum cortisol was evaluated in 31 children aged 4 to 11 years with mild asthma. There were reductions in serum cortisol from baseline in all treatment groups (14%, 22%, and 13% for ADVAIR HFA, ADVAIR HFA with spacer, and ADVAIR DISKUS, respectively).</paragraph>

The incidence of abnormal tests at 500 mcg twice daily was greater than placebo. In a 2-year trial carried out with the DISKHALER inhalation device in 64 subjects with mild, persistent asthma (mean FEV<sub>1</sub> 91% of predicted) randomized to fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily or placebo, no subject receiving fluticasone propionate had an abnormal response to 6-hour cosyntropin infusion (peak serum cortisol &lt;18 mcg/dL). With a peak cortisol threshold of &lt;35 mcg/dL, 1 subject receiving fluticasone propionate (4%) had an abnormal response at 1 year; repeat testing at 18 months and 2 years was normal. Another subject receiving fluticasone propionate (5%) had an abnormal response at 2 years. No subject on placebo had an abnormal response at 1 or 2 years.</paragraph>

Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (&lt;10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable peak levels (C<sub>max</sub>) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC<sub>(0-τ)</sub> averaged 8.43 pg•h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg•h/mL).

Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68). Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta-agonist–mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose. Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration. </paragraph>

The primary efficacy endpoints were predose FEV<sub>1</sub> and withdrawals due to worsening asthma. This trial was stratified according to baseline asthma therapy: subjects using beta-agonists (albuterol alone [n = 142], salmeterol [n = 84], or ICS [n = 134] [daily doses of beclomethasone dipropionate 252 to 336 mcg; budesonide 400 to 600 mcg; flunisolide 1,000 mcg; fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol 176 mcg; fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 200 mcg; or triamcinolone acetonide 600 to 800 mcg]). Baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements were similar across treatments: ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg, 2.29 L; fluticasone propionate 44 mcg, 2.20 L; salmeterol, 2.33 L; and placebo, 2.27 L. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Predefined withdrawal criteria for lack of efficacy, an indicator of worsening asthma, were utilized for this placebo-controlled trial. Worsening asthma was defined as a clinically important decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> or PEF, increase in use of VENTOLIN (albuterol, USP) Inhalation Aerosol, increase in night awakenings due to asthma, emergency intervention or hospitalization due to asthma, or requirement for asthma medicine not allowed by the protocol. As shown in Table 3, statistically significantly fewer subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg were withdrawn due to worsening asthma compared with salmeterol and placebo. Fewer subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg were withdrawn due to worsening asthma compared with fluticasone propionate 44 mcg; however, the difference was not statistically significant.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The FEV<sub>1</sub> results are displayed in Figure 1. Because this trial used predetermined criteria for worsening asthma, which caused more subjects in the placebo group to be withdrawn, FEV<sub>1</sub> results at Endpoint (last available FEV<sub>1</sub> result) are also provided. Subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg had significantly greater improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (0.58 L, 27%) compared with fluticasone propionate 44 mcg (0.36 L, 18%), salmeterol (0.25 L, 12%), and placebo (0.14 L, 5%). These improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> with ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg were achieved regardless of baseline asthma therapy (albuterol alone, salmeterol, or ICS). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The subjective impact of asthma on subjects’ perception of health was evaluated through use of an instrument called the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (based on a 7-point scale where 1 = maximum impairment and 7 = none). Subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg had clinically meaningful improvements in overall asthma-specific quality of life as defined by a difference between groups of ≥0.5 points in change from baseline AQLQ scores (difference in AQLQ score of 1.14 [95% CI: 0.85, 1.44] compared with placebo). </paragraph>

The primary efficacy endpoints were predose FEV<sub>1</sub> and withdrawals due to worsening asthma. Baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements were similar across treatments: ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg, 2.23 L; fluticasone propionate 110 mcg, 2.18 L; salmeterol, 2.22 L; and placebo, 2.17 L.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy results in this trial were similar to those observed in Trials 1 and 2. Subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg had significantly greater improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (0.41 L, 20%) compared with fluticasone propionate 110 mcg (0.19 L, 9%), salmeterol (0.15 L, 8%), and placebo (-0.12 L, -6%). Significantly fewer subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg were withdrawn from this trial for worsening asthma (7%) compared with salmeterol (24%) and placebo (54%). Fewer subjects receiving ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg were withdrawn due to worsening asthma (7%) compared with fluticasone propionate 110 mcg (11%); however, the difference was not statistically significant. </paragraph>

As shown in Figure 2, morning PEF improved significantly with ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg compared with fluticasone propionate 220 mcg over the 12-week treatment period. Improvements in morning PEF observed with ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg were similar to improvements observed with ADVAIR DISKUS 500 mcg/50 mcg.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>This 1-year, open-label, non-U.S. trial evaluated the safety of ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg, ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg, and ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg given as 2 inhalations twice daily in 325 subjects. This trial was stratified into 3 groups according to baseline asthma therapy: subjects using short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists alone (n = 42), salmeterol (n = 91), or ICS (n = 277). Subjects treated with short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists alone, salmeterol, or low doses of ICS with or without concurrent salmeterol received ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg. Subjects treated with moderate doses of ICS with or without concurrent salmeterol received ADVAIR HFA 115 mcg/21 mcg. Subjects treated with high doses of ICS with or without concurrent salmeterol received ADVAIR HFA 230 mcg/21 mcg. Baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 L.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (0.17 to 0.35 L at 4 weeks) were seen across all 3 treatments and were sustained throughout the 52-week treatment period. Few subjects (3%) were withdrawn due to worsening asthma over 1 year. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The onset of action and progression of improvement in asthma control were evaluated in 2 placebo-controlled U.S. trials and 1 active-controlled U.S. trial. Following the first dose, the median time to onset of clinically significant bronchodilatation (≥15% improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub>) in most subjects was seen within 30 to 60 minutes. Maximum improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> occurred within 4 hours, and clinically significant improvement was maintained for 12 hours (Figure 3).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following the initial dose, predose FEV<sub>1</sub> relative to Day 1 baseline improved markedly over the first week of treatment and continued to improve over the 12 weeks of treatment in all 3 trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No diminution in the 12-hour bronchodilator effect was observed with either ADVAIR HFA 45 mcg/21 mcg (Figures 3 and 4) or ADVAIR HFA 230/21 as assessed by FEV<sub>1</sub> following 12 weeks of therapy.</paragraph>

This can happen when you stop taking oral corticosteroid medicines (such as prednisone) and start taking a medicine containing an inhaled steroid (such as ADVAIR HFA). During this transition period, when your body is under stress such as from fever, trauma (such as a car accident), infection, surgery, or worse COPD symptoms, adrenal insufficiency can get worse and may cause death.</item>
