                        <paragraph>Instruct patients that ANNOVERA should be used as directed <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.2">How to Start ANNOVERA (2.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. One ANNOVERA should be placed in the vagina. For maximum contraceptive effectiveness, ANNOVERA is to remain in the vagina continuously for 21 days (3 complete weeks). It is removed for a 1-week dose-free interval, and during this time a withdrawal bleed usually occurs. The removed vaginal system should be cleaned with mild soap and warm water, patted dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and placed in its case during the 1-week dose- free interval. At the end of the dose-free interval, the vaginal system should be cleaned prior to being placed back in the vagina for another 21 continuous days (3 complete weeks). This pattern of ANNOVERA use made up of 3-weeks in and 1-week out is a cycle of use; one ANNOVERA vaginal system will provide contraception for 13 cycles.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>With clean hands, the user can choose an insertion position that is comfortable, such as lying down, squatting, or standing. The sides of the vaginal system are pressed together for insertion into the vagina. When properly inserted, the vaginal system should be entirely in the vagina and behind the pelvic bone. The day and time of insertion should be noted so that the vaginal system can be removed 3 weeks later on the same day and at about the same time.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ANNOVERA can be removed by hooking an index finger into the vaginal system inside the vagina and gently pulling the vaginal system.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For patient instructions regarding cleaning the vaginal system, <content styleCode="italics">see FDA-approved <linkHtml href="#PI">Patient Information</linkHtml>.</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Contraceptive efficacy of ANNOVERA may be reduced if a woman deviates from the recommended use. ANNOVERA should remain in the vagina for a continuous period of 21 days (3 weeks); then ANNOVERA should be taken out of the vagina for 7 days. In a 28-day cycle, a deviation that involves ANNOVERA being out of the vagina for less than 7 days will not increase pregnancy risk. In a 28-day cycle, a deviation that involves ANNOVERA being out of the vagina for more than 7 days will increase pregnancy risk and back-up contraception is recommended in these instances. Deviations from the recommended regimen may result in a new vaginal system change day <content styleCode="italics">[See FDA- approved <linkHtml href="#PI">Patient Information</linkHtml>].</content>

                              <paragraph>ANNOVERA can be accidently expelled. Accidental expulsion could occur while removing a tampon, during coitus, or with straining during a bowel movement. If the vaginal system is accidentally expelled once during the 21 days of intravaginal use and is replaced within 2 hours, contraceptive efficacy should not be reduced and no back-up contraception is needed. If the vaginal system is accidently expelled, wash it with mild soap and warm water, rinse and pat dry with a clean cloth towel or paper towel, and replace it as soon as possible.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>During the 21 days of continuous use, if ANNOVERA is out of the vagina for more than 2 continuous hours or more than 2 cumulative hours (multiple inadvertent removals or expulsions adding up to 2 hours), then back-up contraception, such as male condoms or spermicide, should be used until the vaginal system has been in the vagina for 7 consecutive days. The use of combined hormonal contraceptives (those containing an estrogen) for emergency contraception during use of ANNOVERA is not recommended.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The use of CHCs increases the risk of VTE, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Risk factors for VTEs include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of CHCs <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]</content>. While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of CHCs is well established, the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy, and especially during the postpartum period (see <linkHtml href="#fig1">Figure 1</linkHtml>). The rate of VTE in females using CHCs has been estimated to be 3â12 cases per 10,000 woman-years.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of CHC use and when restarting hormonal contraception following a break of 4 weeks or longer. The risk of VTE due to CHCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for females who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs, for females who use CHCs, for pregnant females, and for females in the postpartum period. To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 females who are not pregnant and do not use CHCs are followed for 1 year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Females using ANNOVERA may experience unscheduled (breakthrough) bleeding and spotting, especially during the first month of use. If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on ANNOVERA, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different CHC.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Based on subject diaries from the two clinical efficacy trials of ANNOVERA <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Clinical Trial Experience (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>, 5â10% of females experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. The average number of days with unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, in Treatment Cycles 1 to 13 for those females who experienced unscheduled bleeding and/or spotting, was 1 day or less per cycle. A total of 41 subjects (1.7%) discontinued use due to menstrual disorders including metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, and abnormal withdrawal bleeding.</paragraph>

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (removed vaginal system for &gt;2 hours during the first 21 days or does not replace after 7 days of vaginal system- free period), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and perform a pregnancy test. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule and misses 2 consecutive periods, perform a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Some females may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping ANNOVERA, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The clinical trials that evaluated the safety of ANNOVERA were obtained from three 13- cycle trials. One trial was conducted entirely in the U.S. (15 sites), and the other two were global studies that included 5 U.S. sites and 7 international sites (Australia, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Finland, Hungary, Sweden). All three trials were open label and enrolled healthy females, desiring contraception, 18 to 40 years of age. At about 50% enrollment, females with BMI &gt;29 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were excluded due to the occurrence of two VTEs in this subgroup. In total, 2,308 females contributed 21,590 cycles of exposure for safety evaluation and 999 completed 13 cycles; there were 209 subjects with BMI &gt;29 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who contributed 1,254 cycles of exposure with 36 subjects completing 13 cycles. The demographic profile for subjects was: mean age 26.7 years, mean BMI 24.1 (16.0- 41.5) kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 67% were from the U.S. The racial distribution was 71% Caucasian, 14% African American, 4% Asian, and 11% Other; 30% of the population was Hispanic.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In a drug-drug interaction study with ANNOVERA and the concurrent use of three different formulations of vaginal miconazole, the use of water-based vaginal miconazole cream resulted in no change in exposure to EE or SA from the vaginal system. However, the use of either the 1- day or the 3-day oil-based miconazole suppository was associated with an overall increase in exposure up to 67% for EE and 32% for SA. Considering the potential long-term effect on vaginal system performance, concurrent use of oil-based vaginal suppositories should not occur with ANNOVERA use. If there is a need to treat a vaginal condition, water-based vaginal cream or oral therapy may be used concurrently with the vaginal system <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

               <title>11 DESCRIPTION</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>ANNOVERA (segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol vaginal system) is a toroidal- shaped (ring), nonbiodegradable, flexible, opaque white vaginal system containing two active components, a progestin, segesterone acetate, and an estrogen, ethinyl estradiol. When placed in the vagina, each ANNOVERA releases an approximate average 0.15 mg/day of segesterone acetate and 0.013 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol over the 21 days in-use period of each cycle for up to 13 cycles (total of 273 days). Each cycle is 28 days, with 21 days in and 7 days out.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The inactive ingredients are dibutyltin dilaurate, silicone elastomers, silicone medical adhesive, and titanium dioxide. The elastomers are all methyl siloxane-based polymers.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The vaginal system body has an overall diameter of 56 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 8.4 mm. It contains two channels of approximately 3.0 mm diameter and 27 mm length into which steroid-containing cores are inserted. Each ANNOVERA contains 103 mg of SA distributed throughout both cores and 17.4 mg of EE distributed throughout only one core. The core containing 40% SA and 12% EE of its mass is 3 mm in diameter and 18 mm in length. The core containing 50% SA of its mass is 3 mm in diameter and 11 mm in length. Contact between the cores and the vaginal system body is fixed by coating the channels with silicone medical adhesive before introducing the cores. After insertion of the cores, the channels are sealed with the silicone medical adhesive.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The structural formulas, and properties for the active components are shown below:</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The steroids diffuse out of the vaginal system with release rates that vary over time. Based on in vitro data, the daily release rates of SA and EE are higher during each initial 24â48 hours of use achieving a somewhat lower steady-state with continued use over the subsequent days in each cycle. The vaginal system is designed to be used for 13 cycles (1 year) on a 21/7 days in/out schedule. The total in-use time with the 21/7 days in/out schedule over 13 cycles is 273 days. Based on the residual amount of drug in vaginal systems used in clinical trials over 13 cycles, a total of 41.3 mg of SA and 3.4 mg of EE are released over this period. This translates to an approximate average daily dose of 0.15 mg of segesterone acetate and 0.013 mg of ethinyl estradiol with higher release rate expected at the beginning of dosing and a lower release rate toward the end.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ANNOVERA were determined in 39 women who used ANNOVERA for up to 13 cycles. Following vaginal administration, SA and EE were absorbed into systemic circulation with median t<sub>max</sub> of about 2 hours in Cycle 1, Cycle 3, and Cycle 13. Concentrations of both components declined after t<sub>max</sub> and became more constant after 96 hours post-dose. Over subsequent cycles of use, the peak serum concentrations of SA and EE declined. Serum concentration-time profiles of SA and EE for Cycles 1, 3, and 13 of ANNOVERA use are provided in Figure 2 and Figure 3 with PK parameters summarized in Table 5 and Table 6.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In vitro data show that both SA and EE are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme. In human serum, two oxidative metabolites (5Î±-dihydro- and 17Î±- hydroxy-5Î±-dihydro metabolites) constitute 50% of exposure relative to SA. Both metabolites are not considered as active metabolites with EC<sub>50</sub> to progesterone receptor 10-fold higher than that of SA. EE is primarily metabolized by aromatic hydroxylation, but a wide variety of hydroxylated and methylated metabolites are formed. These are present as free metabolites and as sulfate and glucuronide conjugates. The hydroxylated EE metabolites have weak estrogenic activity.</paragraph>

The results showed that a single-dose vaginal administration of 1,200 mg miconazole suppository on Day 8 of ANNOVERA use increased the systemic exposure of EE (AUC<sub>Day8-21</sub>) by approximately 67%. A similar trend was observed with SA with AUC<sub>Day8-9</sub>, AUC<sub>Day8-10,</sub> and AUC<sub>Day8-21</sub> increasing by approximately 30%, 32%, and 19%, respectively. When 200 mg miconazole vaginal suppositories were administered on Day 8, Day 9, and Day 10 of ANNOVERA use, EE AUC<sub>Day8-11</sub> and AUC<sub>Day8-21</sub> were increased by 9% and 42%, respectively. SA AUC<sub>Day8-11</sub> and AUC<sub>Day8- 21</sub> were increased by 28% and 27%, respectively. Water-based vaginal miconazole cream had no effect on ANNOVERA <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S7.3">Drug Interactions (7.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The efficacy of ANNOVERA was evaluated in two 1-year multicenter trials enrolling 2,265 females, age 18â40 years, who were healthy and sexually active with regular menstrual cycles. The trials were conducted in the U.S., Dominican Republic, Brazil, Chile, Finland, Hungary, Sweden, and Australia, with 67.1% of females from the U.S. The racial/ethnic distribution was Caucasian (71.2%), African-American (14.1%), Asian (3.5%), other/multiple races (11.2%); 28.7% of the study population was Hispanic. The mean age was 26.7 years and the mean (range) BMI was 24.1 (16.0, 41.5) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. At approximately 50% enrollment, women with BMI &gt;29.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were no longer enrolled in the two trials and all women with a BMI &gt;29.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were discontinued from the trials.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Based on pooled data from the two trials, 2,111 females â¤35 years of age completed 17,427 evaluable 28-day cycles (cycles in which no back-up contraception was used). The pooled pregnancy rate, evaluated by the Pearl Index (PI), was 2.98 (95% Confidence Interval [2.13, 4.06]) per 100 woman-years of ANNOVERA use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Return to fertility was assessed in 290 of the subjects in the two trials who either desired pregnancy or switched to a nonhormonal method after the trials, and all 290 subjects reported a return to fertility during the 6-month follow-up period (defined as a return of menses or pregnancy).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>ANNOVERA (segesterone acetate and ethinyl estradiol vaginal system) is a toroidal- shaped (ring), nonbiodegradable, flexible, opaque white vaginal system. The vaginal system body has an overall diameter of 56 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 8.4 mm. When placed inside the vagina, each ANNOVERA releases an approximate average 0.15 mg/day of segesterone acetate and 0.013 mg/day of ethinyl estradiol over 21-day in-use period of each cycle for up to 13 cycles (total 273 days). Each cycle is 28 days, with 21 days in and 7 days out.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Each ANNOVERA is individually packaged in an aluminum pouch. The pouch consists of a laminate from outside to inside of polyester, aluminum foil, and polyethylene.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>First insertion of ANNOVERA must be prior to the date of expiration. Discard one year after first insertions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A black compact case is provided with the drug product for storage of ANNOVERA by patients during each 7-day vaginal system-out interval.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The vaginal system should be placed in the compact case after 13 cycles of use and discarded via a drug take-back option if one is available. If a take-back option is unavailable, then discard in the waste receptacle out of reach of children and pets. The vaginal system should NOT be flushed down the toilet. See www.fda.gov/drugdisposal for more information about disposal of medicines.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Each box contains 1 ANNOVERA vaginal system in a pouch and 1 storage case.</paragraph>

                              <br/>ANNOVERA is a hormone-releasing system used by females who are able to become pregnant to prevent pregnancy. You insert ANNOVERA into your vagina. ANNOVERA is in the shape of a ring that is reusable for 1 year. The vaginal system is made of silicone and contains two female hormones that are slowly released into your vagina and then enter your blood. One hormone is an estrogen called ethinyl estradiol. The other hormone is a progestin called segesterone acetate.</td>

                              <br/>Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for using the vaginal system. The more carefully you follow the directions, the less chance you have of getting pregnant.<br/>Based on the results of two clinical studies that lasted 12 months, about 2 to 4 women out of 100 women may get pregnant during the first year they use ANNOVERA. ANNOVERA was designed to be reused for 1 year. Replace ANNOVERA at the end of 1 year if you choose to continue using ANNOVERA. There is not enough hormone left in the vaginal system to provide you effective birth control after 1 year of use.<br/>The following chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who use different methods of birth control. Each box on the chart contains a list of birth control methods that are similar in how well they work to prevent pregnancy. The most effective methods are at the top of the chart. The box at the bottom of the chart shows the chance of getting pregnant for women who do not use birth control and are trying to get pregnant.<br/>ANNOVERA, a vaginal system with hormones, is in the second box from the top of the chart.<paragraph>

If you take the vaginal system out too soon or put it back in too late, your chance of getting pregnant is higher.<br/>If you are more than 1 or 2 days off schedule for vaginal system insertion you will need to use new vaginal system-in and vaginal system-out days for the remaining cycles of use.

Tell your healthcare provider right away that you have missed your period. Also, tell your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness.

                              <br/>It is not known if hormonal birth control causes breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use.<br/>If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.<br/>Women who use hormonal contraceptives may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.</td>

You may have bleeding or spotting between your scheduled periods especially during the first cycle. This bleeding or spotting tends to decrease after the first cycle. Do not stop taking ANNOVERA because of this bleeding or spotting. If the spotting continues for more than 7 consecutive days or if the bleeding is unusually heavy, call your healthcare provider.<br/>Tell your healthcare provider if you do not have your period.</td>
