Consider also assessing bone turnover status (serum markers of bone turnover or bone biopsy) to evaluate the underlying bone disease that may be present.  Monitor serum calcium weekly for the first month after Prolia administration and monthly thereafter.  Instruct all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including those who are dialysis-dependent, about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of maintaining serum calcium levels with adequate calcium and activated vitamin D supplementation. Treatment with Prolia in these patients should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is experienced in diagnosis and management of CKD-MBD.</content>

                     <title>5.4	Osteonecrosis of the Jaw </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing.  ONJ has been reported in patients receiving denosumab <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.  A routine oral exam should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of Prolia treatment.  A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry is recommended prior to treatment with Prolia in patients with risk factors for ONJ such as invasive dental procedures (e.g. tooth extraction, dental implants, oral surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g. chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and comorbid disorders (e.g. periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures).  Good oral hygiene practices should be maintained during treatment with Prolia.  Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ may increase the risk of developing ONJ.  The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to Prolia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit-risk assessment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Prolia should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon.  In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition.  Discontinuation of Prolia therapy should be considered based on individual benefit-risk assessment.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.5	Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Atypical low energy or low trauma fractures of the shaft have been reported in patients receiving Prolia <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.  These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution.  Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with antiresorptive agents.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area.  They may be bilateral, and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.  A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During Prolia treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain.  Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture.  Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb.  Interruption of Prolia therapy should be considered, pending a benefit-risk assessment, on an individual basis.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Following discontinuation of Prolia treatment, fracture risk increases, including the risk of multiple vertebral fractures.  Treatment with Prolia results in significant suppression of bone turnover and cessation of Prolia treatment results in increased bone turnover above pretreatment values 9 months after the last dose of Prolia. Bone turnover then returns to pretreatment values 24 months after the last dose of Prolia.  In addition, bone mineral density (BMD) returns to pretreatment values within 18 months after the last injection <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S14.1">Clinical Studies (14.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>New vertebral fractures occurred as early as 7 months (on average 19 months) after the last dose of Prolia.  Prior vertebral fracture was a predictor of multiple vertebral fractures after Prolia discontinuation.  Evaluate an individual's benefit-risk before initiating treatment with Prolia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If Prolia treatment is discontinued, patients should be transitioned to an alternative antiresorptive therapy <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In a clinical trial of over 7800 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, serious infections leading to hospitalization were reported more frequently in the Prolia group than in the placebo group <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.  Serious skin infections, as well as infections of the abdomen, urinary tract, and ear, were more frequent in patients treated with Prolia.  Endocarditis was also reported more frequently in Prolia-treated patients.  The incidence of opportunistic infections was similar between placebo and Prolia groups, and the overall incidence of infections was similar between the treatment groups.  Advise patients to seek prompt medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of severe infection, including cellulitis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients on concomitant immunosuppressant agents or with impaired immune systems may be at increased risk for serious infections.  Consider the benefit-risk profile in such patients before treating with Prolia.  In patients who develop serious infections while on Prolia, prescribers should assess the need for continued Prolia therapy.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, treatment with Prolia resulted in significant suppression of bone remodeling as evidenced by markers of bone turnover and bone histomorphometry <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S14.1">Clinical Studies (14.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.  The significance of these findings and the effect of long-term treatment with Prolia are unknown.  The long-term consequences of the degree of suppression of bone remodeling observed with Prolia may contribute to adverse outcomes such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical fractures, and delayed fracture healing.  Monitor patients for these consequences.</paragraph>

In a study of 55 subjects with varying degrees of renal function, serum calcium levels &lt; 7.5 mg/dL or symptomatic hypocalcemia were observed in 5 subjects.

However, the incidence of nonfatal serious infections was 3.3% in the placebo and 4.0% in the Prolia groups.  Hospitalizations due to serious infections in the abdomen (0.7% placebo vs. 0.9% Prolia), urinary tract (0.5% placebo vs. 0.7% Prolia), and ear (0.0% placebo vs. 0.1% Prolia) were reported.

                              <paragraph>The safety of Prolia in the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in the 1-year, primary analysis of a 2-year randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled study of 795 patients (30% men and 70% women) aged 20 to 94 (mean age of 63 years) treated with greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent).  A total of 384 patients were exposed to 5 mg oral daily bisphosphonate (active-control) and 394 patients were exposed to Prolia administered once every 6 months as a 60 mg subcutaneous dose.  All patients were instructed to take at least 1000 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.5% (n = 2) in the active-control group and 1.5% (n = 6) in the Prolia group.  The incidence of serious adverse events was 17% in the active-control group and 16% in the Prolia group.  The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 3.6% and 3.8% for the active-control and Prolia groups, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Adverse reactions reported in â¥ 2% of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and more frequently with Prolia than in the active-control-treated patients are shown in the table below.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The incidence of serious adverse events was 9.2% in the placebo group and 14.7% in the Prolia group.  The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 4.2% and 0.8% for the placebo and Prolia groups, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Adverse reactions reported in â¥ 10% of Prolia-treated patients receiving ADT for prostate cancer or adjuvant AI therapy for breast cancer, and more frequently than in the placebo-treated patients were: arthralgia (13.0% placebo vs. 14.3% Prolia) and back pain (10.5% placebo vs. 11.5% Prolia).  Pain in extremity (7.7% placebo vs. 9.9% Prolia) and musculoskeletal pain (3.8% placebo vs. 6.0% Prolia) have also been reported in clinical trials.  Additionally, in Prolia-treated men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT, a greater incidence of cataracts was observed (1.2% placebo vs. 4.7% Prolia).  Hypocalcemia (serum calcium &lt; 8.4 mg/dL) was reported only in Prolia-treated patients (2.4% vs. 0.0%) at the month 1 visit.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>The effects of denosumab on prenatal development have been studied in both cynomolgus monkeys and genetically engineered mice in which RANK ligand (RANKL) expression was turned off by gene removal (a "knockout mouse").  In cynomolgus monkeys dosed subcutaneously with denosumab throughout pregnancy starting at gestational day 20 and at a pharmacologically active dose 50-fold higher than the recommended human dose based on body weight, there was increased fetal loss during gestation, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality.  Other findings in offspring included absence of axillary, inguinal, mandibular, and mesenteric lymph nodes; abnormal bone growth, reduced bone strength, reduced hematopoiesis, dental dysplasia, and tooth malalignment; and decreased neonatal growth.  At birth out to 1 month of age, infants had measurable blood levels of denosumab (22-621% of maternal levels).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Following a recovery period from birth out to 6 months of age, the effects on bone quality and strength returned to normal; there were no adverse effects on tooth eruption, though dental dysplasia was still apparent; axillary and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent, while mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes were present, though small; and minimal to moderate mineralization in multiple tissues was seen in one recovery animal.  There was no evidence of maternal harm prior to labor; adverse maternal effects occurred infrequently during labor.  Maternal mammary gland development was normal.  There was no fetal NOAEL (no observable adverse effect level) established for this study because only one dose of 50 mg/kg was evaluated.  Mammary gland histopathology at 6 months of age was normal in female offspring exposed to denosumab <content styleCode="italics">in utero</content>; however, development and lactation have not been fully evaluated.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In RANKL knockout mice, absence of RANKL (the target of denosumab) also caused fetal lymph node agenesis and led to postnatal impairment of dentition and bone growth.  Pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland, leading to impaired lactation <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S8.2">Use in Specific Populations (8.2)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S13.2">Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The no effect dose for denosumab-induced teratogenicity is unknown.  However, a C<sub>max</sub> of 22.9 ng/mL was identified in cynomolgus monkeys as a level in which no biologic effects (NOEL) of denosumab were observed (no inhibition of RANKL) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Prolia binds to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption.  Prolia prevents RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors.  Prevention of the RANKL/RANK interaction inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, thereby decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical and trabecular bone.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In clinical studies, treatment with 60 mg of Prolia resulted in reduction in the bone resorption marker serum type 1 C-telopeptide (CTX) by approximately 85% by 3 days, with maximal reductions occurring by 1 month.  CTX levels were below the limit of assay quantitation (0.049 ng/mL) in 39% to 68% of patients 1 to 3 months after dosing of Prolia.  At the end of each dosing interval, CTX reductions were partially attenuated from a maximal reduction of â¥ 87% to â¥ 45% (range: 45% to 80%), as serum denosumab levels diminished, reflecting the reversibility of the effects of Prolia on bone remodeling.  These effects were sustained with continued treatment.  Upon reinitiation, the degree of inhibition of CTX by Prolia was similar to that observed in patients initiating Prolia treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling, subsequent reductions in bone formation markers (i.e., osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal peptide [P1NP]) were observed starting 1 month after the first dose of Prolia.  After discontinuation of Prolia therapy, markers of bone resorption increased to levels 40% to 60% above pretreatment values but returned to baseline levels within 12 months.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Serum and seminal fluid concentrations of denosumab were measured in 12 healthy male volunteers (age range: 43-65 years).  After a single 60 mg subcutaneous administration of denosumab, the mean (Â± SD) C<sub>max</sub> values in the serum and seminal fluid samples were 6170 (Â± 2070) and 100 (Â± 81.9) ng/mL, respectively, resulting in a maximum seminal fluid concentration of approximately 2% of serum levels.  The median (range) T<sub>max</sub> values in the serum and seminal fluid samples were 8.0 (7.9 to 21) and 21 (8.0 to 49) days, respectively.  Among the subjects, the highest denosumab concentration in seminal fluid was 301 ng/mL at 22 days post-dose.  On the first day of measurement (10 days post-dose), nine of eleven subjects had quantifiable concentrations in semen.  On the last day of measurement (106 days post-dose), five subjects still had quantifiable concentrations of denosumab in seminal fluid, with a mean (Â± SD) seminal fluid concentration of 21.1 (Â± 36.5) ng/mL across all subjects (n = 12).</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>In a study of 17 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, midazolam (2 mg oral) was administered 2 weeks after a single-dose of denosumab (60 mg subcutaneous injection), which approximates the T<sub>max</sub> of denosumab.  Denosumab did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, which is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).  This indicates that denosumab should not alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Denosumab is an inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption via inhibition of RANKL.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In ovariectomized monkeys, once-monthly treatment with denosumab suppressed bone turnover and increased BMD and strength of cancellous and cortical bone at doses 50-fold higher than the recommended human dose of 60 mg administered once every 6 months, based on body weight (mg/kg).  Bone tissue was normal with no evidence of mineralization defects, accumulation of osteoid, or woven bone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because the biological activity of denosumab in animals is specific to nonhuman primates, evaluation of genetically engineered ("knockout") mice or use of other biological inhibitors of the RANK/RANKL pathway, namely OPG-Fc, provided additional information on the pharmacodynamic properties of denosumab.  RANK/RANKL knockout mice exhibited absence of lymph node formation, as well as an absence of lactation due to inhibition of mammary gland maturation (lobulo-alveolar gland development during pregnancy)<content styleCode="italics">.</content>  Neonatal RANK/RANKL knockout mice exhibited reduced bone growth and lack of tooth eruption.  A corroborative study in 2-week-old rats given the RANKL inhibitor OPG-Fc also showed reduced bone growth, altered growth plates, and impaired tooth eruption.  These changes were partially reversible in this model when dosing with the RANKL inhibitors was discontinued.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of Prolia in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was demonstrated in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Enrolled women had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spine or total hip.  Women with other diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Paget's disease) or on therapies that affect bone were excluded from this study.  The 7808 enrolled women were aged 60 to 91 years with a mean age of 72 years.  Overall, the mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -2.8, and 23% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline.  Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (N = 3906) or Prolia 60 mg (N = 3902) once every 6 months.  All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of new morphometric (radiologically-diagnosed) vertebral fractures at 3 years.  Vertebral fractures were diagnosed based on lateral spine radiographs (T4-L4) using a semiquantitative scoring method.  Secondary efficacy variables included the incidence of hip fracture and nonvertebral fracture, assessed at 3 years.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Prolia significantly reduced the incidence of new morphometric vertebral fractures at 1, 2, and 3 years (p &lt; 0.0001), as shown in Table 3.  The incidence of new vertebral fractures at year 3 was 7.2% in the placebo-treated women compared to 2.3% for the Prolia-treated women.  The absolute risk reduction was 4.8% and relative risk reduction was 68% for new morphometric vertebral fractures at year 3.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of Prolia in the treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis was demonstrated in a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Enrolled men had a baseline BMD T-score between -2.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck.  Men with a BMD T-score between -1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck were also enrolled if there was a history of prior fragility fracture.  Men with other diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Paget's disease) or on therapies that may affect bone were excluded from this study.  The 242 men enrolled in the study ranged in age from 31 to 84 years with a mean age of 65 years.  Men were randomized to receive SC injections of either placebo (n = 121) or Prolia 60 mg (n = 121) once every 6 months.  All men received at least 1000 mg calcium and at least 800 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of Prolia in the treatment of bone loss in men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were demonstrated in a 3-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study.

The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -0.4, and 22% of men had a vertebral fracture at baseline.  The 1468 men enrolled ranged in age from 48 to 97 years (median 76 years).  Men were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n = 734) or Prolia 60 mg (n = 734) once every 6 months for a total of 6 doses.  Randomization was stratified by age (&lt; 70 years vs. â¥ 70 years) and duration of ADT at trial entry (â¤ 6 months vs. &gt; 6 months).  Seventy-nine percent of patients received ADT for more than 6 months at study entry.  All men received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of Prolia in the treatment of bone loss in women receiving adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer was assessed in a 2-year, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study.  Women had baseline BMD T-scores between -1.0 to -2.5 at the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, and had not experienced fracture after age 25.  The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score was -1.1, and 2.0% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline.  The 252 women enrolled ranged in age from 35 to 84 years (median 59 years).  Women were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either placebo (n = 125) or Prolia 60 mg (n = 127) once every 6 months for a total of 4 doses.  Randomization was stratified by duration of adjuvant AI therapy at trial entry (â¤ 6 months vs. &gt; 6 months).  Sixty-two percent of patients received adjuvant AI therapy for more than 6 months at study entry.  All women received at least 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D supplementation daily.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>With approximately 81% of patients followed for 2 years, treatment differences in BMD at 2 years were 7.6% (-1.4% placebo, +6.2% Prolia) at the lumbar spine, 4.7% (-1.0% placebo, +3.8% Prolia) at the total hip, and 3.6% (-0.8% placebo, +2.8% Prolia) at the femoral neck.</paragraph>

If you have low blood calcium before you start receiving Prolia, it may get worse during treatment. Your low blood calcium must be treated before you receive Prolia. Talk to your doctor before starting Prolia. Your doctor may prescribe calcium and vitamin D to help prevent low calcium levels in your blood while you take Prolia. Take calcium and vitamin D as your doctor tells you to.<br/>If you have advanced chronic kidney disease (may or may not be on kidney dialysis), Prolia may increase your risk for severe low calcium levels in your blood, which could result in hospitalization, life-threatening events and death. A mineral and bone disorder associated with kidney disease called chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) may increase your risk for severe low calcium levels in blood. Before you start Prolia and during treatment, your doctor may need to do certain blood tests to check for CKD-MBD.<br/>Most people with low blood calcium levels do not have symptoms, but some people may have symptoms.
