                  <paragraph>The steps in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones are controlled by thyrotropin (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, TSH) secreted by the anterior pituitary. This hormoneâs secretion is in turn controlled by a feedback mechanism effected by the thyroid hormones themselves and by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), a tripeptide of hypothalamic origin. Endogenous thyroid hormone secretion is suppressed when exogenous thyroid hormones are administered to euthyroid individuals in excess of the normal glandâs secretion.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones exert their physiologic action are not well understood. These hormones enhance oxygen consumption by most tissues of the body, increase the basal metabolic rate, and the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Thus, they exert a profound influence on every organ system in the body and are of particular importance in the development of the central nervous system.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The normal thyroid gland contains approximately 200 mcg of levothyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) per gram of gland, and 15 mcg of liothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) per gram. The ratio of these two hormones in the circulation does not represent the ratio in the thyroid gland, since about 80 % of peripheral liothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) comes from monodeiodination of levothyroxine. Peripheral monodeiodination of levothyroxine at the 5 position (inner ring) also results in the formation of reverse liothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), which is calorigenically inactive.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Liothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) levels are low in the fetus and newborn, in old age, in chronic caloric deprivation, hepatic cirrhosis, renal failure, surgical stress, and chronic illnesses representing what has been called the âT<sub>3</sub> thyronine syndrome.â</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Pharmacokinetics</content> - Animal studies have shown that T<sub>4</sub> is only partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The degree of absorption is dependent on the vehicle used for its administration and by the character of the intestinal contents, the intestinal flora, including plasma protein, and soluble dietary factors, all of which bind thyroid and thereby make it unavailable for diffusion. Only 41% is absorbed when given in a gelatin capsule as opposed to a 74% absorption when given with an albumin carrier.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Depending on other factors, absorption has varied from 48 to 79% of the administered dose. Fasting increases absorption. Malabsorption syndromes, as well as dietary factors, (childrenâs soybean formula, concomitant use of anionic exchange resins such as cholestyramine) cause excessive fecal loss. T<sub>3</sub> is almost totally absorbed, 95% in 4 hours. The hormones contained in the natural preparations are absorbed in a manner similar to the synthetic hormones.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>More than 99% of circulating hormones are bound to serum proteins, including thyroid-binding globulin (TBg), thyroid-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBa), whose capacities and affinities vary for the hormones. The higher affinity of levothyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) for both TBg and TBPA as compared to triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) partially explains the higher serum levels and longer half-life of the former hormone. Both protein-bound hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with minute amounts of free hormone, the latter accounting for the metabolic activity.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Deiodination of levothyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) occurs at a number of sites, including liver, kidney, and other tissues. The conjugated hormone, in the form of glucuronide or sulfate, is found in the bile and gut where it may complete an enterohepatic circulation. Eighty-five percent of levothyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) metabolized daily is deiodinated.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">General</content> - Thyroid hormones should be used with great caution in a number of circumstances where the integrity of the cardiovascular system, particularly the coronary arteries, is suspected. These include patients with angina pectoris or the elderly, in whom there is a greater likelihood of occult cardiac disease. In these patients therapy should be initiated with low doses, i.e., 15-30 mg NP Thyroid<sup>Â®</sup>. When, in such patients, a euthyroid state can only be reached at the expense of an aggravation of the cardiovascular disease, thyroid hormone dosage should be reduced.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Thyroid hormone therapy in patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus or adrenal cortical insufficiency aggravates the intensity of their symptoms. Appropriate adjustments of the various therapeutic measures directed at these concomitant endocrine diseases are required.

However, if the patientâs thyroid gland has sufficient function, the decreased free levothyroxine will result in a compensatory increase in levothyroxine output by the thyroid. Therefore, patients without a functioning thyroid gland who are on thyroid replacement therapy may need to increase their thyroid dose if estrogens or estrogen-containing oral contraceptives are given.</content>

TBg may also be increased during infectious hepatitis. Decreases in TBg concentrations are observed in nephrosis, acromegaly, and after androgen or corticosteroid therapy. Familial hyper- or hypothyroxine-binding-globulinemias have been described. The incidence of TBg deficiency approximates 1 in 9,000.

                  <paragraph>2. Biotin supplementation is known to interfere with thyroid hormone immunoassays that are based on a biotin and streptavidin interaction, which may result in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days prior to thyroid testing.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>3. Medicinal or dietary iodine interferes with all in vivo tests of radio-iodine uptake, producing low uptakes which may not be relative of a true decrease in hormone synthesis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>4. The persistence of clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism in spite of adequate dosage replacement indicates either poor patient compliance, poor absorption, excessive fecal loss, or inactivity of the preparation. Intracellular resistance to thyroid hormone is quite rare.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Signs and Symptoms</content> - Excessive doses of thyroid result in a hypermetabolic state resembling in every respect the condition of endogenous origin. The condition may be self-induced.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Treatment of Overdosage</content> - Dosage should be reduced or therapy temporarily discontinued if signs and symptoms of overdosage appear. Treatment may be reinstituted at a lower dosage. In normal individuals, normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function is restored in 6 to 8 weeks after thyroid suppression.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Treatment of acute massive thyroid hormone overdosage is aimed at reducing gastrointestinal absorption of the drugs and counteracting central and peripheral effects, mainly those of increased sympathetic activity. Vomiting may be induced initially if further gastrointestinal absorption can reasonably be prevented and barring contraindications such as coma, convulsions, or loss of the gagging reflex. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Oxygen may be administered and ventilation maintained. Cardiac glycosides may be indicated if congestive heart failure develops. Measures to control fever, hypoglycemia, or fluid loss should be instituted if needed. Antiadrenergic agents, particularly propranolol, have been used advantageously in the treatment of increased sympathetic activity. Propranolol may be administered intravenously at a dosage of 1 to 3 mg, over a 10-minute period or orally, 80 to 160 mg/day, initially, especially when no contraindications exist for its use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Other adjunctive measures may include administration of cholestyramine to interfere with thyroxine absorption, and glucocorticoids to inhibit conversions of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The dosage of thyroid hormones is determined by the indication and must in every case be individualized according to patient response and laboratory findings.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T<sub>4</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub>, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T<sub>4</sub> levels (see PRECAUTIONS).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Thyroid hormones are given orally. In acute, emergency conditions, injectable levothyroxine sodium may be given intravenously when oral administration is not feasible or desirable, as in the treatment of myxedema coma, or during total parenteral nutrition. Intramuscular administration is not advisable because of reported poor absorption.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Hypothyroidism</content> - Therapy is usually instituted using low doses, with increments which depend on the cardiovascular status of the patient. The usual starting dose is 30 mg NP Thyroid<sup>Â®</sup>, with increments of 15 mg every 2 to 3 weeks. A lower starting dosage, 15 mg/day, is recommended in patients with long standing myxedema, particularly if cardiovascular impairment is suspected, in which case extreme caution is recommended. The appearance of angina is an indication for a reduction in dosage. Most patients require 60 to 120 mg/day. Failure to respond to doses of 180 mg suggests lack of compliance or malabsorption. Maintenance dosages 60 to 120 mg/day usually result in normal serum levothyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) levels. Adequate therapy usually results in normal TSH and T<sub>4</sub> levels after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Readjustment of thyroid hormone dosage should be made within the first four weeks of therapy, after proper clinical and laboratory evaluations, including serum levels of T<sub>4</sub>, bound and free, and TSH.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>T<sub>3</sub> may be used in preference to levothyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) during radio-isotope scanning procedures, since induction of hypothyroidism in those cases is more abrupt and can be of shorter duration. It may also be preferred when impairment of peripheral conversion of T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> is suspected.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Myxedema Coma</content> - Myxedema coma is usually precipitated in the hypothyroid patient of long-standing by intercurrent illness or drugs such as sedatives and anesthetics and should be considered a medical emergency. Therapy should be directed at the correction of electrolyte disturbances and possible infection besides the administration of thyroid hormones. Corticosteroids should be administered routinely. T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> may be administered via a nasogastric tube but the preferred route of administration of both hormones is intravenous. Levothyroxine sodium (T<sub>4</sub>) is given at starting dose of 400 mcg (100 mcg/mL) given rapidly, and is usually well tolerated, even in the elderly. This initial dose is followed by daily supplements of 100 to 200 mcg given intravenously. Normal T<sub>4</sub> levels are achieved in 24 hours followed in 3 days by threefold elevation of T<sub>3</sub>. Oral therapy with thyroid hormone would be resumed as soon as the clinical situation has been stabilized and the patient is able to take oral medication.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Thyroid Cancer</content> - Exogenous thyroid hormone may produce regression of metastases from follicular and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid and is used as ancillary therapy of these conditions with radioactive iodine. TSH should be suppressed to low or undetectable levels. Therefore, larger amounts of thyroid hormone than those used for replacement therapy are required. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is usually unresponsive to this therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Thyroid Suppression Therapy</content> - Administration of thyroid hormone in doses higher than those produced physiologically by the gland results in suppression of the production of endogenous hormone. This is the basis for the thyroid suppression test and is used as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs of mild hyperthyroidism in whom base line laboratory tests appear normal, or to demonstrate thyroid gland autonomy in patients with Graves ophthalmopathy. 131I uptake is determined before and after the administration of the exogenous hormone. A 50% or greater suppression of uptake indicates a normal thyroid-pituitary axis and thus rules out thyroid gland autonomy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For adults, the usual suppressive dose of levothyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) is 1.56 mcg/kg of body weight per day given for 7 to 10 days. These doses usually yield normal serum T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> levels and lack of response to TSH.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Thyroid hormones should be administered cautiously to patients in whom there is strong suspicion of thyroid gland autonomy, in view of the fact that the exogenous hormone effects will be additive to the endogenous source.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Pediatric Dosage</content> - Pediatric dosage should follow the recommendations summarized in Table 1. In infants with congenital hypothyroidism, therapy with full doses should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis has been made.</paragraph>
