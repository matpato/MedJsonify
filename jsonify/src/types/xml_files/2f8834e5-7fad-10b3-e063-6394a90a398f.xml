Treatment of such inadvertent administration should consist of vasodilation, in addition to further appropriate treatment of anaphylaxis

                  <paragraph>Due to the lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis, the true incidence of adverse reactions associated with the systemic use of epinephrine is difficult to determine. Adverse reactions reported in observational trials, case reports, and studies are listed below. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine include anxiety; apprehensiveness; restlessness; tremor; weakness; dizziness; sweating; palpitations; pallor; nausea and vomiting; headache; and/or respiratory difficulties. These symptoms occur in some persons receiving therapeutic doses of epinephrine, but are more likely to occur in patients with hypertension or hyperthyroidism

Clinical experience with the use of epinephrine suggests that the adverse reactions seen in children are similar in nature and extent to those both expected and reported in adults. Since the dose of epinephrine delivered from epinephrine injection is fixed, consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0.15 mg are deemed necessary.

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies for the treatment of anaphylaxis have not been performed in subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, other reported clinical experience with use of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis has identified that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to the effects of epinephrine. Therefore, epinephrine injection should be administered with caution in elderly individuals, who may be at greater risk for developing adverse reactions after epinephrine administration

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Overdosage of epinephrine may produce extremely elevated arterial pressure, which may result in cerebrovascular hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients. Overdosage may also result in pulmonary edema because of peripheral vascular constriction together with cardiac stimulation. Treatment consists of a rapidly acting vasodilators or alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs and/or respiratory support.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Epinephrine overdosage can also cause transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia, and these may be accompanied by potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Premature ventricular contractions may appear within one minute after injection and may be followed by multifocal ventricular tachycardia (prefibrillation rhythm). Subsidence of the ventricular effects may be followed by atrial tachycardia and occasionally by atrioventricular block. Treatment of arrhythmias consists of administration of a beta-adrenergic blocking drug such as propranolol.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Overdosage sometimes results in extreme pallor and coldness of the skin, metabolic acidosis, and kidney failure. Suitable corrective measures must be taken in such situations.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Epinephrine injection, USP 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg is an auto-injector and a combination product containing drug and device components.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each epinephrine injection, USP 0.3 mg delivers a single dose of 0.3 mg epinephrine from epinephrine injection, USP (0.3 mL) in a sterile solution.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each epinephrine injection, USP 0.15 mg delivers a single dose of 0.15 mg epinephrine from epinephrine injection, USP (0.15 mL) in a sterile solution.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Epinephrine injection, USP 0.3 mg and epinephrine injection, USP 0.15 mg each contain 1.1 mL of epinephrine solution. 0.3 mL and 0.15 mL epinephrine solution are dispensed for epinephrine injection, USP 0.3 mg and epinephrine injection, USP 0.15 mg, respectively, when activated. The solution remaining after activation is not available for future use and should be discarded.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each 0.3 mL in epinephrine injection, USP 0.3 mg contains 0.3 mg epinephrine, 2.6 mg sodium chloride, not more than 1.5 mg chlorobutanol, 0.45 mg sodium bisulfite, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH, and water for injection. The pH range is 2.2-5.0.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each 0.15 mL in epinephrine injection, USP 0.15 mg contains 0.15 mg epinephrine, 1.3 mg sodium chloride, not more than 0.75 mg chlorobutanol, 0.225 sodium bisulfite, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH, and water for injection. The pH range is 2.2-5.0.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic catecholamine. Chemically, epinephrine is (-)-3,4-Dihydroxy-α-[(methylamino)methyl]benzyl alcohol with the following structure:</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Epinephrine solution deteriorates rapidly on exposure to air or light, turning pink from oxidation to adrenochrome and brown from the formation of melanin. Replace epinephrine injection, USP if the epinephrine solution appears discolored (pinkish or brown color), cloudy, or contains particles.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Thoroughly review the patient instructions and operation of epinephrine injection, USP with patients and caregivers prior to use [see

                        <paragraph>Through its action on alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine lessens the vasodilation and increased vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis, which can lead to loss of intravascular fluid volume and hypotension.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Through its action on beta-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and helps alleviate bronchospasm, wheezing, and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema, and may relieve gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxer effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach, intestine, uterus and urinary bladder.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When given intramuscularly or subcutaneously, epinephrine has a rapid onset and short duration of action.</paragraph>

These signs and symptoms usually subside rapidly, especially with rest, quiet, and recumbency. Patients with hypertension or hyperthyroidism may develop more severe or persistent effects, and patients with coronary artery disease could experience angina.
