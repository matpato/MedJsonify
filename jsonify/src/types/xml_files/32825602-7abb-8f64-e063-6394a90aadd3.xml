                        <paragraph>Risperidone tablets can be administered once or twice daily. Initial dosing is 2 mg per day. May increase the dose at intervals of 24 hours or greater, in increments of 1 to 2 mg per day, as tolerated, to a recommended dose of 4 to 8 mg per day. In some patients, slower titration may be appropriate. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a range of 4 mg to 16 mg per day. However, doses above 6 mg per day for twice daily dosing were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than lower doses, were associated with more extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse effects, and are generally not recommended. In a single study supporting once-daily dosing, the efficacy results were generally stronger for 8 mg than for 4 mg. The safety of doses above 16 mg per day has not been evaluated in clinical trials

While it is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment beyond an acute response in mania is desirable, both for maintenance of the initial response and for prevention of new manic episodes, there are no systematically obtained data to support the use of risperidone tablets in such longer-term treatment (i.e., beyond 3 weeks). The physician who elects to use risperidone tablets for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID216">When risperidone tablets are co-administered with enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine), the dose of risperidone tablets should be increased up to double the patient's usual dose. It may be necessary to decrease the risperidone tablets dose when enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine are discontinued

  </content>. Similar effect may be expected with co-administration of risperidone tablets with other enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital).

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When fluoxetine or paroxetine is co-administered with risperidone tablets, the dose of risperidone tablets should be reduced. The risperidone tablets dose should not exceed 8 mg per day in adults when co-administered with these drugs. When initiating therapy, risperidone tablets should be titrated slowly. It may be necessary to increase the risperidone tablets dose when enzyme inhibitors such as fluoxetine or paroxetine are discontinued

                     <title>5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID231">Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks),largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In two of four placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, a higher incidence of mortality was observed in patients treated with furosemide plus risperidone when compared to patients treated with risperidone alone or with placebo plus furosemide. No pathological mechanism has been identified to explain this finding, and no consistent pattern for cause of death was observed.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4 Tardive Dyskinesia</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Given these considerations, risperidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on risperidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with risperidone despite the presence of the syndrome.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID239">Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics including risperidone. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics, including risperidone, should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic, including risperidone, was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of risperidone.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a long-term, open-label extension study in adolescent patients with schizophrenia, weight increase was reported as a treatment-emergent adverse event in 14% of patients. In 103 adolescent patients with schizophrenia, a mean increase of 9.0 kg was observed after 8 months of risperidone treatment. The majority of that increase was observed within the first 6 months. The average percentiles at baseline and 8 months, respectively, were 56 and 72 for weight, 55 and 58 for height, and 51 and 71 for body mass index.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In long-term, open-label trials (studies in patients with autistic disorder or other psychiatric disorders), a mean increase of 7.5 kg after 12 months of risperidone treatment was observed, which was higher than the expected normal weight gain (approximately 3 to 3.5 kg per year adjusted for age, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention normative data). The majority of that increase occurred within the first 6 months of exposure to risperidone. The average percentiles at baseline and 12 months, respectively, were 49 and 60 for weight, 48 and 53 for height, and 50 and 62 for body mass index.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In one 3-week, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescent patients with acute manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder, increases in body weight were higher in the risperidone groups than the placebo group, but not dose related (1.90 kg in the risperidone 0.5 to 2.5 mg group, 1.44 kg in the risperidone 3 to 6 mg group, and 0.65 kg in the placebo group). A similar trend was observed in the mean change from baseline in body mass index.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When treating pediatric patients with risperidone for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected with normal growth.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. </paragraph>

Syncope was reported in 0.2% (6/2,607) of risperidone-treated patients in Phase 2 and 3 studies in adults with schizophrenia. The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 2 mg total (either once daily or 1 mg twice daily) in normal adults and 0.5 mg twice daily in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment

Risperidone should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia, and in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

                        <paragraph ID="ID247">Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction associated with risperidone treatment, especially when ascertained by direct questioning of patients. This adverse reaction is dose-related, and in a study utilizing a checklist to detect adverse events, 41% of the high-dose patients (risperidone 16 mg/day) reported somnolence compared to 16% of placebo patients. Direct questioning is more sensitive for detecting adverse events than spontaneous reporting, by which 8% of risperidone 16 mg/day patients and 1% of placebo patients reported somnolence as an adverse reaction. Since risperidone has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that risperidone therapy does not affect them adversely.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The data described in this section are derived from a clinical trial database consisting of 9,803 adult and pediatric patients exposed to one or more doses of risperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania, autistic disorder, and other psychiatric disorders in pediatrics and elderly patients with dementia. Of these 9,803 patients, 2,687 were patients who received risperidone while participating in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The conditions and duration of treatment with risperidone varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, fixed- and flexible-dose, placebo- or active-controlled studies and open-label phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, and short-term (up to 12 weeks) and longer-term (up to 3 years) exposures. Safety was assessed by collecting adverse events and performing physical examinations, vital signs, body weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

                           <br/>  Adverse event data elicited by a checklist for side effects from a large study comparing 5 fixed doses of risperidone (1, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg/day) were explored for dose-relatedness of adverse events. A Cochran-Armitage Test for trend in these data revealed a positive trend (p&lt;0.05) for the following adverse reactions: somnolence, vision abnormal, dizziness, palpitations, weight increase, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, sexual function abnormal, fatigue, and skin discoloration.

                        <paragraph>Between-group comparisons for pooled placebo-controlled trials in adults revealed no statistically significant differences between risperidone and placebo in mean changes from baseline in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals, and heart rate. When all risperidone doses were pooled from randomized controlled trials in several indications, there was a mean increase in heart rate of 1 beat per minute compared to no change for placebo patients. In short-term schizophrenia trials, higher doses of risperidone (8 to 16 mg/day) were associated with a higher mean increase in heart rate compared to placebo (4 to 6 beats per minute). In pooled placebo-controlled acute mania trials in adults, there were small decreases in mean heart rate, similar among all treatment groups.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the two placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with autistic disorder (aged 5 to 16 years) mean changes in heart rate were an increase of 8.4 beats per minute in the risperidone groups and 6.5 beats per minute in the placebo group. There were no other notable ECG changes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a placebo-controlled acute mania trial in children and adolescents (aged 10 to 17 years), there were no significant changes in ECG parameters, other than the effect of risperidone to transiently increase pulse rate (&lt; 6 beats per minute). In two controlled schizophrenia trials in adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years), there were no clinically meaningful changes in ECG parameters including corrected QT intervals between treatment groups or within treatment groups over time.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID308">The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of risperidone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions include: alopecia, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, cardiopulmonary arrest, catatonia, diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with impaired glucose metabolism, dysgeusia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, ileus, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, intestinal obstruction, jaundice, mania, pancreatitis, pituitary adenoma, precocious puberty, pulmonary embolism, QT prolongation, sleep apnea syndrome, somnambulism, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), sudden death, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, urinary retention, and water intoxication.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Postmarketing cases of extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia and dyskinesia) have been reported in patients concomitantly taking methylphenidate and risperidone when there was an increase or decrease in dosage, initiation, or discontinuation of either or both medications.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Published data from observational studies, birth registries, and case reports on the use of atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy do not report a clear association with antipsychotics and major birth defects. A prospective observational study including 6 women treated with risperidone demonstrated placental passage of risperidone. A retrospective cohort study from a Medicaid database of 9,258 women exposed to antipsychotics during pregnancy did not indicate an overall increased risk for major birth defects. There was a small increase in the risk of major birth defects (RR=1.26, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.56) and of cardiac malformations (RR=1.26, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.81) in a subgroup of 1,566 women exposed to risperidone during the first trimester of pregnancy; however, there is no mechanism of action to explain the difference in malformation rates.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Rat offspring mortality increased during the first 4 days of lactation when pregnant rats were dosed throughout gestation at 0.16 to 5 mg/kg/day which are 0.1 to 3 times the MRHD of 16 mg/day based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2 </sup>body surface area. It is not known whether these deaths were due to a direct effect on the fetuses or pups or to effects on the dams; a no-effect dose could not be determined. The rate of stillbirths was increased at 2.5 mg/kg or 1.5 times the MRHD based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>body surface area.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a rat cross-fostering study the number of live offspring was decreased, the number of stillbirths increased, and the birth weight was decreased in offspring of drug-treated pregnant rats. In addition, the number of deaths increased by Day 1 among offspring of drug-treated pregnant rats, regardless of whether or not the offspring were cross-fostered. Risperidone also appeared to impair maternal behavior in that offspring body weight gain and survival (from Day 1 to 4 of lactation) were reduced in offspring born to control but reared by drug-treated dams. All of these effects occurred at 5 mg/kg which is 3 times the MRHD based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>and the only dose tested in the study.

Bone length and density were decreased with a no-effect dose of 0.31 mg/kg/day; this dose produced plasma AUC of risperidone plus its active metabolite paliperidone (9-hydroxy-risperidone) that were similar to those in children and adolescents receiving the MRHD of 6 mg/day. In addition, sexual maturation was delayed at all doses in both males and females. The above effects showed little or no reversibility in females after a 12 week drug-free recovery period.

                        <paragraph>Juvenile rats, treated with oral risperidone from days 12 to 50 of age (equivalent to the period of infancy through adolescence in humans) showed impaired learning and memory performance (reversible only in females), with a no-effect dose of 0.63 mg/kg/day which is 0.5 times the MRHD of 6 mg/day for children, based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2 </sup>body surface area. This dose produced plasma AUC of risperidone plus paliperidone about half the exposure observed in humans at the MRHD. No other consistent effects on neurobehavioral or reproductive development were seen up to the highest tested dose of 1.25 mg/kg/day which is 1 time the MRHD and produced plasma AUC of risperidone plus paliperidone that were about two thirds of those observed in humans at the MRHD of 6 mg/day for children.

In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drug's known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness and sedation, tachycardia and hypotension, and extrapyramidal symptoms. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 240 mg, was associated with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, prolonged QT, and widened QRS. Another case, involving an estimated overdose of 36 mg, was associated with a seizure.</paragraph>

Steady-state concentrations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone are reached in 5 to 6 days (measured in extensive metabolizers).</paragraph>

Neither risperidone nor 9-hydroxyrisperidone displaces each other from plasma binding sites. High therapeutic concentrations of sulfamethazine (100 mcg/mL), warfarin (10 mcg/mL), and carbamazepine (10mcg/mL) caused only a slight increase in the free fraction of risperidone at 10 ng/mL and 9-hydroxyrisperidone at 50 ng/mL, changes of unknown clinical significance.

                        <paragraph>Risperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The main metabolic pathway is through hydroxylation of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by the enzyme, CYP 2D6. A minor metabolic pathway is through
 
  <content styleCode="italics">N</content>-dealkylation. The main metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, has similar pharmacological activity as risperidone. Consequently, the clinical effect of the drug results from the combined concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>CYP 2D6, also called debrisoquin hydroxylase, is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of many neuroleptics, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and other drugs. CYP 2D6 is subject to genetic polymorphism (about 6% to 8% of Caucasians, and a very low percentage of Asians, have little or no activity and are "poor metabolizers") and to inhibition by a variety of substrates and some non-substrates, notably quinidine. Extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers convert risperidone rapidly into 9-hydroxyrisperidone, whereas poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers convert it much more slowly. Although extensive metabolizers have lower risperidone and higher 9-hydroxyrisperidone concentrations than poor metabolizers, the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, after single and multiple doses, are similar in extensive and poor metabolizers.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Risperidone and its metabolites are eliminated via the urine and, to a much lesser extent, via the feces. As illustrated by a mass balance study of a single 1 mg oral dose of 14C-risperidone administered as solution to three healthy male volunteers, total recovery of radioactivity at 1 week was 84%, including 70% in the urine and 14% in the feces.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The apparent half-life of risperidone was 3 hours (CV=30%) in extensive metabolizers and 20 hours (CV=40%) in poor metabolizers. The apparent half-life of 9-hydroxyrisperidone was about 21 hours (CV=20%) in extensive metabolizers and 30 hours (CV=25%) in poor metabolizers. The pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, after single and multiple doses, were similar in extensive and poor metabolizers, with an overall mean elimination half-life of about 20 hours.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Risperidone could be subject to two kinds of drug-drug interactions. First, inhibitors of CYP 2D6 interfere with conversion of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone

  </content>This occurs with quinidine, giving essentially all recipients a risperidone pharmacokinetic profile typical of poor metabolizers. The therapeutic benefits and adverse effects of risperidone in patients receiving quinidine have not been evaluated, but observations in a modest number (n=~70) of poor metabolizers given risperidone do not suggest important differences between poor and extensive metabolizers. Second, co-administration of known enzyme inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause a decrease in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (
  
   <linkHtml href="#ID309">7</linkHtml>)].
 
  </content>It would also be possible for risperidone to interfere with metabolism of other drugs metabolized by CYP 2D6. Relatively weak binding of risperidone to the enzyme suggests this is unlikely

                        <paragraph>In vitro studies indicate that risperidone is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP 2D6. Therefore, risperidone is not expected to substantially inhibit the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by this enzymatic pathway. In drug interaction studies, risperidone did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of donepezil and galantamine, which are metabolized by CYP 2D6.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies demonstrated that drugs metabolized by other CYP isozymes, including 1A1, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4, are only weak inhibitors of risperidone metabolism.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Risperidone was administered in the diet at doses of 0.63, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg for 18 months to mice and for 25 months to rats. These doses are equivalent to approximately 0.2, 0.75, and 3 times (mice) and 0.4, 1.5, and 6 times (rats) the MRHD of 16 mg/day, based on mg/m

Serum prolactin levels were not measured during the risperidone carcinogenicity studies; however, measurements during subchronic toxicity studies showed that risperidone elevated serum prolactin levels 5 to 6 fold in mice and rats at the same doses used in the carcinogenicity studies. An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be prolactin-mediated.

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia was established in four short-term (4- to 8-week) controlled trials of psychotic inpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for schizophrenia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Several instruments were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms in these studies, among them the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multi-item inventory of general psychopathology traditionally used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in schizophrenia. The BPRS psychosis cluster (conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) is considered a particularly useful subset for assessing actively psychotic schizophrenic patients. A second traditional assessment, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient. In addition, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Scale for Assessing Negative Symptoms (SANS) were employed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The results of the trials follow:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(1) In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=160) involving titration of risperidone in doses up to 10 mg/day (twice-daily schedule), risperidone was generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, on the BPRS psychosis cluster, and marginally superior to placebo on the SANS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(2) In an 8-week, placebo-controlled trial (n=513) involving 4 fixed doses of risperidone (2 mg/day, 6 mg/day, 10 mg/day, and 16 mg/day, on a twice-daily schedule), all 4 risperidone groups were generally superior to placebo on the BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score; the 3 highest risperidone dose groups were generally superior to placebo on the PANSS negative subscale. The most consistently positive responses on all measures were seen for the 6 mg dose group, and there was no suggestion of increased benefit from larger doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(3) In an 8-week, dose comparison trial (n=1,356) involving 5 fixed doses of risperidone (1 mg/day, 4 mg/day, 8 mg/day, 12 mg/day, and 16 mg/day, on a twice-daily schedule), the four highest risperidone dose groups were generally superior to the 1 mg risperidone dose group on BPRS total score, BPRS psychosis cluster, and CGI severity score. None of the dose groups were superior to the 1 mg group on the PANSS negative subscale. The most consistently positive responses were seen for the 4 mg dose group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(4) In a 4-week, placebo-controlled dose comparison trial (n=246) involving 2 fixed doses of risperidone (4 and 8 mg/day on a once-daily schedule), both risperidone dose groups were generally superior to placebo on several PANSS measures, including a response measure (&gt;20% reduction in PANSS total score), PANSS total score, and the BPRS psychosis cluster (derived from PANSS). The results were generally stronger for the 8 mg than for the 4 mg dose group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a longer-term trial, 365 adult outpatients predominantly meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and who had been clinically stable for at least 4 weeks on an antipsychotic medication were randomized to risperidone (2 to 8 mg/day) or to an active comparator, for 1 to 2 years of observation for relapse.

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years was demonstrated in two short-term (6 and 8 weeks), double-blind controlled trials. All patients met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia and were experiencing an acute episode at time of enrollment. In the first trial (study #1), patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups: risperidone 1 to 3 mg/day (n=55, mean modal dose =2.6 mg), risperidone 4 to 6 mg/day (n=51, mean modal dose =5.3 mg), or placebo (n=54). In the second trial (study #2), patients were randomized to either risperidone 0.15 to 0.6 mg/day (n = 132, mean modal dose = 0.5 mg) or risperidone 1.5 to 6 mg/day (n= 125, mean modal dose =4 mg). In all cases, study medication was initiated at 0.5 mg/day (with the exception of the 0.15 to 0.6 mg/day group in study #2, where the initial dose was 0.05 mg/day) and titrated to the target dosage range by approximately Day 7. Subsequently, dosage was increased to the maximum tolerated dose within the target dose range by Day 14. The primary efficacy variable in all studies was the mean change from baseline in total PANSS score. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Results of the studies demonstrated efficacy of risperidone in all dose groups from 1 to 6 mg/day compared to placebo, as measured by significant reduction of total PANSS score. The efficacy on the primary parameter in the 1 to 3 mg/day group was comparable to the 4 to 6 mg/day group in study #1, and similar to the efficacy demonstrated in the 1.5 to 6 mg/day group in study #2. In study #2, the efficacy in the 1.5 to 6 mg/day group was statistically significantly greater than that in the 0.15 to 0.6 mg/day group. Doses higher than 3 mg/day did not reveal any trend towards greater efficacy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptomatology (irritability, disruptive/aggressive behavior, sleep, elevated mood, speech, increased activity, sexual interest, language/thought disorder, thought content, appearance, and insight) in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary outcome in these trials was change from baseline in the YMRS total score. The results of the trials follow:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(1) In one 3-week placebo-controlled trial (n=246), limited to patients with manic episodes, which involved a dose range of risperidone 1 to 6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 3 mg/day (mean modal dose was 4.1 mg/day), risperidone was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(2) In another 3-week placebo-controlled trial (n=286), which involved a dose range of 1 to 6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 3 mg/day (mean modal dose was 5.6 mg/day), risperidone was superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of mania in children or adolescents with Bipolar I disorder was demonstrated in a 3-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial including patients ranging in ages from 10 to 17 years who were experiencing a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder. Patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups: risperidone 0.5 to 2.5 mg/day (n=50, mean modal dose =1.9 mg), risperidone 3 to 6 mg/day (n=61, mean modal dose =4.7 mg), or placebo (n=58). In all cases, study medication was initiated at 0.5 mg/day and titrated to the target dosage range by Day 7, with further increases in dosage to the maximum tolerated dose within the targeted dose range by Day 10. The primary rating instrument used for assessing efficacy in this study was the mean change from baseline in the total YMRS score.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Results of this study demonstrated efficacy of risperidone in both dose groups compared with placebo, as measured by significant reduction of total YMRS score. The efficacy on the primary parameter in the 3 to 6 mg/day dose group was comparable to the 0.5 to 2.5 mg/day dose group. Doses higher than 2.5 mg/day did not reveal any trend towards greater efficacy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID388">The efficacy of risperidone with concomitant lithium or valproate in the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes was established in one controlled trial in adult patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder. This trial included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(1) In this 3-week placebo-controlled combination trial, 148 in- or outpatients on lithium or valproate therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms were randomized to receive risperidone, placebo, or an active comparator, in combination with their original therapy. Risperidone, in a dose range of 1 to 6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 2 mg/day (mean modal dose of 3.8 mg/day), combined with lithium or valproate (in a therapeutic range of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.4 mEq/L or 50 mcg/mL to 120 mcg/mL, respectively) was superior to lithium or valproate alone in the reduction of YMRS total score.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(2) In a second 3-week placebo-controlled combination trial, 142 in- or outpatients on lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine therapy with inadequately controlled manic or mixed symptoms were randomized to receive risperidone or placebo, in combination with their original therapy. Risperidone, in a dose range of 1 to 6 mg/day, once daily, starting at 2 mg/day (mean modal dose of 3.7 mg/day), combined with lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine (in therapeutic ranges of 0.6 mEq/L to 1.4 mEq/L for lithium, 50 mcg/mL to 125 mcg/mL for valproate, or 4 to 12 mcg/mL for carbamazepine, respectively) was not superior to lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. A possible explanation for the failure of this trial was induction of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone clearance by carbamazepine, leading to subtherapeutic levels of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of risperidonein the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder was established in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents (aged 5 to 16 years) who met the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder. Over 90% of these subjects were under 12 years of age and most weighed over 20 kg (16 to 104.3 kg).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy was evaluated using two assessment scales: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the Clinical Global Impression - Change (CGI-C) scale. The primary outcome measure in both trials was the change from baseline to endpoint in the Irritability subscale of the ABC (ABC-I). The ABC-I subscale measured the emotional and behavioral symptoms of autism, including aggression towards others, deliberate self-injuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. The CGI-C rating at endpoint was a co-primary outcome measure in one of the studies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The results of these trials are as follows:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(1) In one of the 8-week, placebo-controlled trials, children and adolescents with autistic disorder (n=101), aged 5 to 16 years, received twice daily doses of placebo or risperidone 0.5 to 3.5 mg/day on a weight-adjusted basis. Risperidone, starting at 0.25 mg/day or 0.5 mg/day depending on baseline weight (&lt;20 kg and ≥20 kg, respectively) and titrated to clinical response (mean modal dose of 1.9 mg/day, equivalent to 0.06 mg/kg/day), significantly improved scores on the ABC-I subscale and on the CGI-C scale compared with placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(2) In the other 8-week, placebo-controlled trial in children with autistic disorder (n=55), aged 5 to 12 years, risperidone 0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg/day given once or twice daily, starting at 0.01 mg/kg/day and titrated to clinical response (mean modal dose of 0.05 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 1.4 mg/day), significantly improved scores on the ABC-I subscale compared with placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph ID="ID393">A third trial was a 6-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a lower than recommended dose of risperidone in subjects (N=96) 5 to 17 years of age with autistic disorder (defined by DSM-IV criteria) and associated irritability and related behavioral symptoms. Approximately 77% of patients were younger than 12 years of age (mean age = 9), and 88% were male. Most patients (73%) weighed less than 45 kg (mean weight = 40 kg). Approximately 90% of patients were antipsychotic- na

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There were two weight-based, fixed doses of risperidone (high-dose and low-dose). The high dose was 1.25 mg per day for patients weighing 20 to &lt;45 kg, and it was 1.75 mg per day for patients weighing ≥ 45 kg. The low dose was 0.125 mg per day for patients weighing 20 to &lt;45 kg, and it was 0.175 mg per day for patients weighing ≥45 kg. The dose was administered once daily in the morning, or in the evening if sedation occurred.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist – Irritability subscale (ABC-I) score from baseline to the end of Week 6. The study demonstrated the efficacy of high-dose risperidone, as measured by the mean change in ABC-I score. It did not demonstrate efficacy for low-dose risperidone. The mean baseline ABC-I scores were 29 in the placebo group (n=35), 27 in the risperidone low-dose group (n=30), and 28 in the risperidone high-dose group (n=31). The mean changes in ABC-I scores were -3.5, -7.4, and -12.4 in the placebo, low-dose, and high-dose group respectively. The results in the high-dose group were statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001) but not in the low-dose group (p=0.164).</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following completion of the first 8-week double-blind study, 63 patients entered an open-label study extension where they were treated with risperidone for 4 or 6 months (depending on whether they received risperidone or placebo in the double-blind study). During this open-label treatment period, patients were maintained on a mean modal dose of risperidone of 1.8 to 2.1 mg/day (equivalent to 0.05 to 0.07 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients who maintained their positive response to risperidone (response was defined as ≥25% improvement on the ABC-I subscale and a CGI-C rating of 'much improved' or 'very much improved') during the 4 to 6 month open-label treatment phase for about 140 days, on average, were randomized to receive risperidoneor placebo during an 8-week, double-blind withdrawal study (n=39 of the 63 patients). A pre-planned interim analysis of data from patients who completed the withdrawal study (n=32), undertaken by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate in the risperidone group compared with the placebo group. Based on the interim analysis results, the study was terminated due to demonstration of a statistically significant effect on relapse prevention. Relapse was defined as ≥25% worsening on the most recent assessment of the ABC-I subscale (in relation to baseline of the randomized withdrawal phase).</paragraph>
