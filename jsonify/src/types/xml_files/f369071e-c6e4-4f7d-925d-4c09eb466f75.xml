                  <paragraph>Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets has a high potential for abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, can result in overdose and death [
 
  <content styleCode="italics">see Overdosage (10)</content>], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. Before prescribing methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks, proper storage of the drug, and proper disposal of any unused drug. Throughout methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment, reassess each patient’s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction [

                        <paragraph>Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence
 
  <linkHtml href="#ID_161aa18e-fcae-4a81-8001-6086b238f8e4">(9.2)</linkHtml>]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage
 
  <linkHtml href="#ID_ee0a67f3-f42a-4585-b5e1-4b8a40e80587">(10)]</linkHtml>, and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Published studies and postmarketing reports on methylphenidate use during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There may be risks to the fetus associated with the use of CNS stimulants use during pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No effects on morphological development were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10 and 15 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis. However, spina bifida was observed in rabbits at a dose 52 times the MRHD given to adolescents. A decrease in pup body weight was observed in a pre- and post-natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses 6 times the MRHD given to adolescents (see Data).

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>CNS stimulants, such as methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion. No fetal and/or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy; however, premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine-dependent mothers.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Animal Data</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In embryo-fetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 75 and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. Malformations (increased incidence of fetal spina bifida) were observed in rabbits at the highest dose, which is approximately 52 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rabbits was 60 mg/kg/day (15times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). There was no evidence of morphological development effects in rats, although increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen at the highest dose level (10 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis), which was also maternally toxic. The no effect level for embryo-fetal development in rats was 25 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). When methylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 45 mg/kg/day, offspring body weight gain was decreased at the highest dose (6 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis), but no other effects on postnatal development were observed. The no effect level for pre- and postnatal development in rats was 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis).

                        <paragraph>Limited published literature, based on milk sampling from seven mothers reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses of 0.16% to 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.1 and 2.7. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Rats treated with methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood. A deficit in acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only. The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study conducted in young rats, methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day for 9 weeks, starting early in the postnatal period (postnatal Day 7) and continuing through sexual maturity (postnatal Week 10). When these animals were tested as adults (postnatal Weeks 13 to 14), decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis) or greater, and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose (8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.5 timesthe MRHD given to children on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). The clinical significance of the long-term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown.

                        <paragraph>The effect of dexmethylphenidate, the pharmacologically active d-enantiomer of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo- and open-label active (moxifloxacin)-controlled study following single doses of dexmethlyphenidate XR 40 mg (maximum recommended adult total daily dosage) in 75 healthy volunteers. Electrocardiograms were collected up to 12 hours postdose. Frederica’s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval (QTcF). The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was less than 5 ms, and the upper limit of the 90% confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time-matched comparisons versus placebo. This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident exposure response relationship.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice, methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas, and in males only, an increase in hepatoblastomas at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg/kg/day. This dose is approximately 2 times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to children on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis. Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type. There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors. The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors and the significance of these results to humans is unknown.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 4 times the MRHD (children) on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 24-week carcinogenicity study in the transgenic mouse strain p53+/-, which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. Male and female mice were fed diets containing the same concentration of methylphenidate as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study; the high-dose groups were exposed to 60 to 74 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate.</paragraph>

Methylphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18-week continuous breeding study. The study was conducted at doses up to 160 mg/kg/day, approximately 10times the MRHD of 60 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m
