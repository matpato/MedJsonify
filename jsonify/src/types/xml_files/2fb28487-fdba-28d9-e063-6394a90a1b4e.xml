                        <paragraph>The therapeutic activity of dihydroergotamine in migraine is generally attributed to the agonist effect at 5-HT
 
  <sub>1D</sub>receptors. Two current theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT
 
  <sub>1D</sub>receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT
 
  <sub>1D</sub>receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on arterio-venous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which correlates with the relief of migraine headache. The alternative hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT
 
  <sub>1D</sub>receptors on sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release. In addition, dihydroergotamine possesses oxytocic properties.

                              <paragraph>Four dihydroergotamine mesylate metabolites have been identified in human plasma following oral administration. The major metabolite, 8’-β-hydroxydihydroergotamine, exhibits affinity equivalent to its parent for adrenergic and 5-HT receptors and demonstrates equivalent potency in several venoconstrictor activity models, in
 
  <content styleCode="italics">vivo</content>and in
 
  <content styleCode="italics">vitro</content>. The other metabolites, i.e., dihydrolysergic acid, dihydrolysergic amide and a metabolite formed by oxidative opening of the proline ring are of minor importance. Following nasal administration, total metabolites represent only 20%-30% of plasma AUC. The systemic clearance of dihydroergotamine mesylate following I.V. and I.M. administration is 1.5 L/min. Quantitative pharmacokinetic characterization of the four metabolites has not been performed.

                              <paragraph>The major excretory route of dihydroergotamine is via the bile in the feces. After intranasal administration the urinary recovery of parent drug amounts to about 2% of the administered dose compared to 6% after I.M. administration. The total body clearance is 1.5 L/min which reflects mainly hepatic clearance. The renal clearance (0.1 L/min) is unaffected by the route of dihydroergotamine administration. The decline of plasma dihydroergotamine is biphasic with a terminal half-life of about 10 hours.</paragraph>

Pharmacokinetic interactions have been reported in patients treated orally with other ergot alkaloids (e.g., increased levels of ergotamine) and macrolide antibiotics, principally troleandomycin, presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A metabolism of the alkaloids by troleandomycin. Dihydroergotamine has also been shown to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A catalyzed reactions and rare reports of ergotism have been obtained from patients treated with dihydroergotamine and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., troleandomycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), and in patients treated with dihydroergotamine and protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir), presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A metabolism of ergotamine (

                  <paragraph>The efficacy of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray for the acute treatment of migraine headaches was evaluated in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in the U.S. The patient population for the trials was predominantly female (87%) and Caucasian (95%) with a mean age of 39 years (range 18 to 65 years). Patients treated a single moderate to severe migraine headache with a single dose of study medication and assessed pain severity over the 24 hours following treatment. Headache response was determined 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after dosing and was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In studies 1 and 2, a four-point pain intensity scale was utilized; in studies 3 and 4, a five-point scale was used that included both pain response and restoration of function for “severe” or “incapacitating” pain, a less clear endpoint. Although rescue medication was allowed in all four studies, patients were instructed not to use them during the four-hour observation period. In studies 3 and 4, a total dose of 2 mg was compared to placebo. In studies 1 and 2, doses of 2 and 3 mg were evaluated, and showed no advantage of the higher dose for a single treatment. In all studies, patients received a regimen consisting of 0.5 mg in each nostril, repeated in 15 minutes (and again in another 15 minutes for the 3 mg dose in studies 1 and 2).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The percentage of patients achieving headache response 4 hours after treatment was significantly greater in patients receiving 2 mg doses of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray compared to those receiving placebo in 3 of the 4 studies (see Tables 1 &amp; 2 and Figures 1 &amp; 2).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Patients were not allowed to use additional treatments for eight hours prior to study medication dosing and during the four-hour observation period following study treatment. Following the 4-hour observation period, patients were allowed to use additional treatments. For all studies, the estimated probability of patients using additional treatments for their migraines over the 24 hours following the single 2 mg dose of study treatment is summarized in Figure 3 below.</paragraph>

All patients received a single treatment of study medication for their migraine attack. The plot also includes patients who had no response to the initial dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Neither age nor sex appear to affect the patient’s response to Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray. While patients with menstrual migraine, migraine with aura, and migraine without aura by medical history were included in the clinical evaluation of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray, patients were not required to report the specific type of migraine treated with study medication. Thus, neither the effect of menses on migraine nor the presence or the absence of aura were assessed. The racial distribution of patients was insufficient to determine the effect of race on the efficacy of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray.</paragraph>

Less potent inhibitors include saquinavir, nefazodone, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, zileuton, and clotrimazole.

               <title>Local Irritation</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>Approximately 30% of patients using Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray (compared to 9% of placebo patients) have reported irritation in the nose, throat, and/or disturbances in taste. Irritative symptoms include congestion, burning sensation, dryness, paraesthesia, discharge, epistaxis, pain, or soreness. The symptoms were predominantly mild to moderate in severity and transient. In approximately 70% of the above mentioned cases, the symptoms resolved within four hours after dosing with Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray. Examinations of the nose and throat in a small subset (N = 66) of study participants treated for up to 36 months (range 1-36 months) did not reveal any clinically noticeable injury. Other than this limited number of patients, the consequences of extended and repeated use of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray on the nasal and/or respiratory mucosa have not been systematically evaluated in patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Nasal tissue in animals treated with dihydroergotamine mesylate daily at nasal cavity surface area exposures (in mg/mm
 
  <sup>2</sup>) that were equal to or less than those achieved in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose of 0.08 mg/kg/day showed mild mucosal irritation characterized by mucous cell and transitional cell hyperplasia and squamous cell metaplasia. Changes in rat nasal mucosa at 64 weeks were less severe than at 13 weeks. Local effects on respiratory tissue after chronic intranasal dosing in animals have not been evaluated.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamines, triptans, opioids, or a combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (i.e., medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.</paragraph>

A no-effect level for adverse effects on embryofetal development was not identified in rats. Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased skeletal ossification at 3.6 mg/day. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits was 1.2 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased body weight and impaired reproductive function (decreased mating indices) in the offspring at doses of 0.16 mg/day or greater. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats was not established. Effects on offspring development occurred at doses below those that produced evidence of maternal toxicity in these studies. Dihydroergotamine-induced intrauterine growth retardation has been attributed to reduced uteroplacental blood flow resulting from prolonged vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels and/or increased myometrial tone.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no data on the presence of dihydroergotamine in human milk; however, ergotamine, a related drug, is present in human milk. There are reports of diarrhea, vomiting, weak pulse, and unstable blood pressure in breastfed infants exposed to ergotamine. Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray may reduce milk supply because it may decrease prolactin levels. Because of the potential for reduced milk supply and serious adverse events in the breastfed infant, including diarrhea, vomiting, weak pulse, and unstable blood pressure, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray and for 3 days after the last dose. Breast milk supply during this time should be pumped and discarded.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Of the 1,796 patients and subjects treated with Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray doses 2 mg or less in U.S. and foreign clinical studies, 26 (1.4%) discontinued because of adverse events. The adverse events associated with discontinuation were, in decreasing order of frequency: rhinitis 13, dizziness 2, facial edema 2, and one each due to cold sweats, accidental trauma, depression, elective surgery, somnolence, allergy, vomiting, hypotension, and paraesthesia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most commonly reported adverse events associated with the use of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray during placebo-controlled, double-blind studies for the treatment of migraine headache and not reported at an equal incidence by placebo-treated patients were rhinitis, altered sense of taste, application site reactions, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray was generally well tolerated. In most instances these events were transient and self-limited and did not result in patient discontinuation from a study. The following table summarizes the incidence rates of adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients who received Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray for the treatment of migraine headaches during placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical studies and were more frequent than in those patients receiving placebo.</paragraph>

                     <title>Other Adverse Events During Clinical Trials</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In the paragraphs that follow, the frequencies of less commonly reported adverse clinical events are presented. Because the reports include events observed in open and uncontrolled studies, the role of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray in their causation cannot be reliably determined. Furthermore, variability associated with adverse event reporting, the terminology used to describe adverse events, etc., limit the value of the quantitative frequency estimates provided. Event frequencies are calculated as the number of patients who used Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray in placebo-controlled trials and reported an event divided by the total number of patients (n=1796) exposed to Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray. All reported events are included except those already listed in the previous table, those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; and rare adverse events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>To date, there have been no reports of acute overdosage with this drug. Due to the risk of vascular spasm, exceeding the recommended dosages of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray is to be avoided.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Excessive doses of dihydroergotamine may result in peripheral signs and symptoms of ergotism. Treatment includes discontinuance of the drug, local application of warmth to the affected area, the administration of vasodilators, and nursing care to prevent tissue damage.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In general, the symptoms of an acute Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray overdose are similar to those of an ergotamine overdose, although there is less pronounced nausea and vomiting with Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray. The symptoms of an ergotamine overdose include the following: numbness, tingling, pain, and cyanosis of the extremities associated with diminished or absent peripheral pulses; respiratory depression; an increase and/or decrease in blood pressure, usually in that order; confusion, delirium, convulsions, and coma; and/or some degree of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In laboratory animals, significant lethality occurs when dihydroergotamine is given at I.V. doses of 44 mg/kg in mice, 130 mg/kg in rats, and 37 mg/kg in rabbits.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Up-to-date information about the treatment of overdosage can often be obtained from a certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified Poison Control Centers are listed in the Physicians’ Desk Reference (PDR).

                  <paragraph>In clinical trials, Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray has been effective for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura.

Fifteen minutes later, an additional one spray (0.5 mg) of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray should be administered in each nostril, for a total dosage of four sprays (2 mg) of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray. Studies have shown no additional benefit from acute doses greater than 2 mg for a single migraine administration.

                  <paragraph>Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray is intended to treat an active migraine headache. Do not try to use it to prevent a headache if you have no symptoms. Do not use it to treat common tension headache or a headache that is not at all typical of your usual migraine headache. Administration of Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray, should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration. There have been reports of fibrosis (stiffening) in the lung or kidney areas in patients following prolonged daily use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate. Rarely, prolonged daily use of other ergot alkaloid drugs (the class of drugs to which Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray belongs) has been associated with heart valvular fibrosis. Rare cases have also been reported in association with the use of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate; however, in those cases, patients also received drugs known to be associated with heart valvular fibrosis.</paragraph>
