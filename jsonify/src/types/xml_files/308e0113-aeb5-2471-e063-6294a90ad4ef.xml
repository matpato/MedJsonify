                              <paragraph>The recommended effluent volume for patients receiving CRRT for acute kidney injury (AKI) is 20 to 25 mL/kg/h. This usually requires a higher prescription of effluent volume. The prescription of REGIOCIT solution must consider the flow rates of the effluent and other therapeutic fluids, the patient’s fluid removal requirements, additional fluid inputs and outputs, and the desired acid-base and electrolyte balance.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The mode of therapy, solute formulations, flow rates and length of therapy should be selected by the physician responsible for managing treatment depending on the clinical condition of the patient as well as the patient’s fluid, electrolyte, acid base and glucose balance.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Dialysate and replacement fluid formulations and flow rates are prescribed in accordance with the patient’s clinical needs. The use of a calcium-containing dialysate or replacement fluid is not recommended, since the calcium provided by these solutions may counteract the anticoagulant effect of citrate in the circuit.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The rate at which REGIOCIT solution is administered depends on the targeted citrate dose and the prescribed blood flow rate. The pre-filter infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution is indexed to the blood flow rate to achieve a target blood citrate concentration of 3 mmol/L of blood (See Table 1). Flow rate for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit should be titrated to achieve a post-filter concentration of ionized calcium in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Prior to initiating therapy, the patient’s systemic ionized calcium concentration should be within the normal physiologic range (1.0 to 1.2 mmol/L) by adjustment of calcium supplementation. A separate infusion of calcium is always required during use of REGIOCIT, due to loss in the effluent. Calcium solution infusion is commenced at the rate of 4 mmol/h, when commencing therapy (see Table 4). Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to physician’s prescription when REGIOCIT is stopped.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Citrate also acts as a buffer source (due to conversion to bicarbonate); the infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution must be considered in relation to the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources (e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid). REGIOCIT solution must be used together with a dialysis solution/replacement solution with appropriate bicarbonate concentration.</paragraph>

                           <text>
                              <paragraph>Monitoring of the post-filter blood ionized calcium (iCa), systemic blood iCa, and total blood calcium levels in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters such as acid-base balance and serum electrolytes are essential to guide appropriate REGIOCIT solution dosage based on the desired level of anticoagulation. Levels should be taken at baseline, 1 hour after initiation (or adjustment), and every 6 hours (See Table 2). Rapidly decreasing systemic ionized calcium levels are an early indicator of citrate accumulation.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Measurement of total calcium and assessment of total-to-ionized calcium ratio is necessary. Citrate accumulation causes systemic ionized calcium levels to drop and the ratio of total-to-ionized calcium increases (total-to-ionized calcium ratio &gt; 2.5). In the presence of impaired citrate metabolism, a progressively higher calcium infusion rate is required to maintain the systemic ionized calcium concentration within the intended target. When a total-to-ionized-calcium ratio &gt; 2.5 is recorded, any one of the following abnormalities reported concurrently increases the likelihood of citrate accumulation:</paragraph>
                              <list listType="unordered">
                                 <item>A rapid decline in systemic iCa concentration despite adequate calcium compensation</item>
                                 <item>A rapid decrease in pH or a decrease in base excess</item>
                                 <item>A rapid increase in anion gap</item>
                              </list>
                              <paragraph>In order to avoid metabolic alkalosis, acid-base balance and systemic ionized calcium can be measured using blood gas analysis. If metabolic alkalosis or citrate accumulation is suspected, decrease the citrate dose while tolerating a post-filter ionized calcium of &lt; 0.5 mmol/L. This can be achieved by either decreasing the blood flow rate to decrease the overall citrate load, increasing the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) to increase the citrate removal, or decreasing the citrate flow to decrease the citrate dose. Dialysate solutions contain bicarbonate below or above physiological range of 22 to 26 mmol/L, and increasing or decreasing the flow rates of the dialysate solutions can impact the acid-base status of the patient.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Plasma levels of sodium, magnesium, potassium, and glucose, and phosphate should be monitored regularly and should be supplemented as needed.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Metabolization of 1 mol of citrate generates 3 mol of bicarbonate. Additional sodium bicarbonate (or buffer source) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance. If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) or change the composition of the CRRT solution.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The United States FDA has made REGIOCIT available to treat patients in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic under an emergency access mechanism called an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>REGIOCIT made available under an EUA have not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that REGIOCIT may be effective for use as a replacement solution in adult patients treated with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) and requiring regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) of the extracorporeal circuit in an ICU setting during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and that the known and potential benefits of REGIOCIT for such use outweigh the known and potential risks of REGIOCIT.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>This EUA for REGIOCIT is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of the products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be needed). The EUA will end when the declaration is terminated or revoked or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.</paragraph>

               <title>Fact Sheet For Patients And Parent/Caregivers Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for REGIOCIT (Sodium Chloride and Sodium Citrate Renal Replacement and Regional Anticoagulant Solution)</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>You are being given REGIOCIT: a replacement solution for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) that also reduces the risk of filter clotting. This fact sheet contains information to help you understand the risks and benefits of taking the REGIOCIT you have received or may receive.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is currently a shortage of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved replacement solutions that may be used to provide CRRT. REGIOCIT is not an FDA-approved medicine in the United States. REGIOCIT is currently approved in Europe and other countries. Read this Fact Sheet for information about REGIOCIT. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions. It is your choice to receive REGIOCIT or stop it at any time.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">What is COVID-19? 
   <br/>
                     </content>COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. This type of coronavirus has not been seen before. This new virus was first found in people in December 2019. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. Older people and people of all ages with severe, long lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, for example seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">What are the symptoms of COVID-19? 
   <br/>
                     </content>The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2-14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">What is REGIOCIT? 
   <br/>
                     </content>Regiocit is a replacement solution for CRRT, which is a form of “dialysis” treatment, that also reduces the risk of filter clotting. Replacement solutions are used during CRRT to help correct acid-base abnormalities and electrolyte abnormalities, remove “uremic” and other toxins and facilitate the use of CRRT to control fluid overload.

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The United States FDA has made REGIOCIT available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>REGIOCIT has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks for such use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The EUA for REGIOCIT is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of these products, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In an open-label randomised study, 54 patients were administered RCA with an equimolar solution of citrate, sodium and chloride, as contained in REGIOCIT solution, and 49 received systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) while undergoing CRRT using continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. Adverse events related to metabolic disorders occurred in 26% of patients in the RCA-treated group, compared to 28% of patients in the UFH-treated group. These adverse events were generally transient and reversible. Metabolic alkalosis was seen in 6% of patients treated with RCA, compared to none treated with UFH, and metabolic acidosis was reported in 6% and 2% of patients in the RCA and UFH groups, respectively. Six patients treated with RCA experienced severe hypocalcemia, compared to one patient treated with UFH.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Citrate provides regional anticoagulation of blood in the continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) extracorporeal circuit by binding calcium and rendering calcium unavailable to the clotting cascade. Several steps of the clotting cascade are dependent on calcium and the absence of calcium prevents clotting in the circuit.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During CRRT, pre-dilution infusion of citrate into the access line of the extracorporeal circuit provides only regional extracorporeal anticoagulation (and thus avoids systemic anticoagulation of the patient) for two reasons. First, once blood from the extracorporeal circuit is returned to the patient, it mixes with the central venous blood which contains calcium. The second way in which a systemic anticoagulant effect is avoided is by infusion of calcium in the post-filter (return) bloodline of the extracorporeal circuit.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>This procedure not only helps neutralize citrate’s anticoagulant effect in the patient’s blood, but also prevents any depletion of the patient’s calcium stores which may result from the loss of calcium (bound to citrate) in the CRRT effluent fluid.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="bold">Pharmacodynamics</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Citrate provides anticoagulation by its ability to form complexes with ionized calcium, making it unavailable to the clotting cascade. In REGIOCIT, sodium concentration has been set to 140 mmol/l as critically ill patients may develop severe hyponatremia. Chloride is set to the level required to balance cations as the solution is hydrogen carbonate free. Sodium and chloride are normal constituents of the human body and are considered to be pharmacologically inactive. Citrate is a normal metabolite in the human body that acts as a first intermediate substance in the Krebs cycle. REGIOCIT does not contain potassium or glucose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two studies provide information on the dose/response relationship between citrate concentration and anticoagulation. In one study,
 
  <content styleCode="italics">ex-vivo</content>anticoagulation with anticoagulant citrate dextrose formula A (ACD-A) in blood collected from six healthy volunteers was studied. The study concluded that the clinically relevant effects of citrate anticoagulation rely solely on the disturbed formation of the calcium-dependent coagulation factors complexes. In this study, the anticoagulation effects of citrate were monitored either by methods that quantify clot formation (i.e., activated clotting time) or by direct assessment of ionized calcium levels.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The correlation between concentrations of ionized calcium and clotting times revealed almost no anticoagulant effect when ionized calcium levels were up to or above 0.50 mmol/L, while clotting times showed a steep increase when calcium levels were decreased below 0.50 mmol/L. With respect to maximum effect, 5.65 mmol/L citrate induced clotting times of infinity in all samples.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Citrate is a normal metabolite in the human body and an intermediate substance in the Krebs cycle. This physiological pathway is capable of processing high amounts of citric acid as long as it occurs at low concentrations. The Krebs cycle takes place in the mitochondria, and all cells that contain these cellular organelles can metabolize citrate. Tissues rich in mitochondria such as liver, skeletal muscles, and kidney therefore have a higher capacity for citrate generation and elimination.</paragraph>
