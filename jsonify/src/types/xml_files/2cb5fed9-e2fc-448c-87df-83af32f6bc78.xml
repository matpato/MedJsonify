                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks’ duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray than those who received placebo <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_0a7189c6-6728-4bf6-a7d0-3a3843b8ec78">6</linkHtml>)]</content>.  Instances of nasal ulceration and nasal septal perforation have been reported in patients following the nasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray until healing has occurred.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered nasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with <content styleCode="italics">Candida albicans </content>has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. Patients using azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of <content styleCode="italics">Candida </content>infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment).</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4 Immunosuppression and Risk of Infections</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective Prescribing Information for VZIG and IG) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.5 Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>When nasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of nasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ritonavir and other strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_4dfa00ac-3370-4c0d-90c3-69120c30aa29">7.2</linkHtml>) and Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID_bdf7d468-4555-48ff-91fe-ff1ed9740163">12.3</linkHtml>)]</content>. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the 3 placebo controlled clinical trials of 2-week duration, 3411 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with 1 spray per nostril of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, or placebo, twice daily. The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same vehicle and device as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Overall, adverse reactions were 16% in the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment groups, 15% in the azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray groups, 13% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray groups, and 12% in the placebo groups. Overall, 1% of patients in both the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and placebo groups discontinued due to adverse reactions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 1 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the seasonal allergic rhinitis controlled clinical trials.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly increased plasma fluticasone propionate exposure following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID_bdf7d468-4555-48ff-91fe-ff1ed9740163">12.3</linkHtml>)]</content>. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Limited data from postmarketing experience with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage, birth defects, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The individual components of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have been marketed for decades. While the data regarding the use of nasal preparations of fluticasone propionate in pregnancy are limited, data from clinical studies of inhaled fluticasone propionate do not indicate an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Animal reproduction studies with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray are not available; however, studies are available with its individual components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of fetal harm in animals at oral doses of azelastine hydrochloride approximately 10 times the clinical daily dose. Oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits, during the period of organogenesis, produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities, decreased embryo-fetal survival, and decreased fetal body weights at doses 530 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily nasal dose (MRHDID) of 0.548 mg. However, the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, fluticasone propionate administered via nose-only inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. Teratogenicity, characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the MRHDID of 200 mcg on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. Experience with corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</paragraph>

Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17, azelastine hydrochloride caused structural abnormalities (oligo-and brachydactylia), delayed ossification, and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg/kg/day). Azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 1200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 68.6 mg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 55 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg/kg/day). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Fluticasone Propionate: In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and mice dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate was teratogenic in both species. Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 5 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats at approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day). Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 45 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice with a dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mcg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the nose-only inhalation route throughout the period of organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at a dose approximately 1 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day); however, there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rats with a dose approximately 0.25 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal nose-only inhalation dose of 5.5 mcg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route throughout organogenesis, fluticasone propionate produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal toxicity, at doses approximately 0.06 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day). Teratogenicity was evident based upon a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at dose approximately 0.4 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day). Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in rabbits with a dose approximately 0.01 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration to rabbits.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a pre-and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), fluticasone propionate was not associated with decreases in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or fertility at doses up to 2 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for seasonal allergic rhinitis have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older. Use of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray for this indication in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by evidence from controlled clinical trials (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray) <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_f6bb7f5d-0f62-4d22-99d9-68abcd01b8e8">6.1</linkHtml>) and Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#ID_587d518a-0530-4bf9-bb7e-b8306901f53d">14</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sixty-one patients ages 4-5 years of age were treated with azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4-5 years of age were similar to those in children 6-11 years of age, but effectiveness has not been established. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Safety and effectiveness of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Controlled clinical studies have shown that nasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with nasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for “catch-up” growth following discontinuation of treatment with nasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving nasal corticosteroids, including azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives.</paragraph>

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Absorption:</content> After nasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the mean (± standard deviation) peak plasma exposure (C<sub>max</sub>) was 194.5 ± 74.4 pg/mL for azelastine and 10.3±3.9 pg/mL for fluticasone propionate and the mean total exposure (AUC) was 4217 ± 2618 pg/mL*hr for azelastine and 97.7 ± 43.1 pg/mL*hr for fluticasone. The median time to peak exposure (t<sub>max</sub>) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1.0 hours for fluticasone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was comparable with monotherapy azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray without sweetener (i.e., approximately 40%). Systemic bioavailability of fluticasone from azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray following nasal administration was 44-61% higher than monotherapy fluticasone propionate (bioavailability for monotherapy fluticasone nasal spray was less than 2%). Due to the low nasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Distribution:</content> Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Elimination:</content> Following nasal administration of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less than 10% as unchanged azelastine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Metabolism:</content> Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. The specific P450 isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17β-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr).</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Ritonavir</content>: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (&lt;10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C<sub>max</sub>) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-τ) averaged 8.43 pg•hr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 pg•hr/mL). Fluticasone propionate C<sub>max</sub> and AUC(0-τ) increased to 318 pg/mL (range, 110 to 648 pg/mL) and 3,102.6 pg•hr/mL (range, 1,207.1 to 5,662.0 pg•hr/mL), respectively, after coadministration of ritonavir with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_4dfa00ac-3370-4c0d-90c3-69120c30aa29">7.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="italics">Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older:</content> The efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis was evaluated in 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 853 patients. The population of the trials was 12 to 78 years of age (64% female, 36% male; 80% white, 16% black, 2% Asian, 1% other).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal spray, and vehicle placebo. The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients’ scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM rTNSS over 2 weeks. The iTNSS was recorded immediately prior to the next dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated statistically significant greater decreases in rTNSS as compared to azelastine hydrochloride and to fluticasone propionate, as well as to placebo. The differences between the monotherapies and placebo also were statistically significant. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 3).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on patient’s health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0=no impairment and 6=maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% CI -0.72, -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -1.05, -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points.</paragraph>

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of this trial was similar to that of the adult trials. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate nasal spray was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5). </paragraph>
