                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Felodipine is a member of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel
         
 
  <br/>antagonists (calcium channel blockers). It reversibly competes with nitrendipine
         
 
  <br/>and/or other calcium channel blockers for dihydropyridine binding sites,
         
 
  <br/>blocks voltage-dependent Ca++ currents in vascular smooth muscle and
         
 
  <br/>cultured rabbit atrial cells, and blocks potassium-induced contracture of the
         
 
  <br/>rat portal vein.
         
 
  <br/>In vitro studies show that the effects of felodipine on contractile processes
         
 
  <br/>are selective, with greater effects on vascular smooth muscle than cardiac
         
 
  <br/>muscle. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro, but such effects
         
 
  <br/>have not been seen in intact animals.
         
 
  <br/>The effect of felodipine on blood pressure is principally a consequence of a
         
 
  <br/>dose related decrease of peripheral vascular resistance in man, with a modest
         
 
  <br/>reflex increase in heart rate (see Cardiovascular Effects). With the exception
         
 
  <br/>of a mild diuretic effect seen in several animal species and man, the effects
         
 
  <br/>of felodipine are accounted for by its effects on peripheral vascular resistance.

                     <title>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Following oral administration, felodipine is almost completely absorbed and
         
 
  <br/>undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. The systemic bioavailability of
         
 
  <br/>felodipine extended-release tablets is approximately 20%. Mean peak
         
 
  <br/>concentrations following the administration of felodipine extended-release
         
 
  <br/>tablets are reached in 2.5 to 5 hours. Both peak plasma concentration and the
         
 
  <br/>area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increase linearly with
         
 
  <br/>doses up to 20 mg. Felodipine is greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins.
         
 
  <br/>Following intravenous administration, the plasma concentration of felodipine
         
 
  <br/>declined triexponentially with mean disposition half-lives of 4.8 minutes,
         
 
  <br/>1.5 hours, and 9.1 hours. The mean contributions of the three individual
         
 
  <br/>phases to the overall AUC were 15%, 40% and 45%, respectively, in the order
         
 
  <br/>of increasing t1/2.
         
 
  <br/>Following oral administration of the immediate-release formulation, the plasma
         
 
  <br/>level of felodipine also declined polyexponentially with a mean terminal t1/2 of
         
 
  <br/>11 to 16 hours. The mean peak and trough steady-state plasma concentrations
         
 
  <br/>achieved after 10 mg of the immediate-release formulation given once a day
         
 
  <br/>to normal volunteers, were 20 and 0.5 nmol/L, respectively. The trough plasma
         
 
  <br/>concentration of felodipine in most individuals was substantially below the
         
 
  <br/>concentration needed to effect a half-maximal decline in blood pressure (EC50)
         
 
  <br/>[4 to 6 nmol/L for felodipine], thus precluding once a day dosing with the
         
 
  <br/>immediate-release formulation.
         
 
  <br/>Following administration of a 10 mg dose of felodipine, the extended-release
         
 
  <br/>formulation, to young, healthy volunteers, mean peak and trough steady-state
         
 
  <br/>plasma concentrations of felodipine were 7 and 2 nmol/L, respectively.
         
 
  <br/>Corresponding values in hypertensive patients (mean age 64) after a 20 mg
         
 
  <br/>dose of felodipine extended-release tablets were 23 and 7 nmol/L. Since the
         
 
  <br/>EC50 for felodipine is 4 to 6 nmol/L, a 5 mg to 10 mg dose of felodipine
         
 
  <br/>extended-release tablets in some patients, and a 20 mg dose in others, would
         
 
  <br/>be expected to provide an antihypertensive effect that persists for 24 hours
         
 
  <br/>(see Cardiovascular Effects and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).
         
 
  <br/>The systemic plasma clearance of felodipine in young healthy subjects is
         
 
  <br/>about 0.8 L/min, and the apparent volume of distribution is about 10 L/kg.
         
 
  <br/>Following an oral or intravenous dose of 14C-labeled felodipine in man, about
         
 
  <br/>70% of the dose of radioactivity was recovered in urine and 10% in the feces.
         
 
  <br/>A negligible amount of intact felodipine is recovered in the urine and feces
         
 
  <br/>(&lt; 0.5%). Six metabolites, which account for 23% of the oral dose, have been
         
 
  <br/>identified; none has significant vasodilating activity.
         
 
  <br/>Following administration of felodipine extended-release tablets to hypertensive
         
 
  <br/>patients, mean peak plasma concentrations at steady-state are about 20%
         
 
  <br/>higher than after a single dose. Blood pressure response is correlated with
         
 
  <br/>plasma concentrations of felodipine.
         
 
  <br/>The bioavailability of felodipine extended-release tablets is influenced by the
         
 
  <br/>presence of food. When administered either with a high fat or carbohydrate
         
 
  <br/>diet, Cmax is increased by approximately 60%; AUC is unchanged. When
         
 
  <br/>felodipine extended-release tablets were administered after a light meal
         
 
  <br/>(orange juice, toast, and cereal), however, there is no effect on felodipine's
         
 
  <br/>pharmacokinetics. The bioavailability of felodipine was increased approximately
         
 
  <br/>2-fold when taken with grapefruit juice. Orange juice does not appear
         
 
  <br/>to modify the kinetics of felodipine extended-release tablets. A similar finding
         
 
  <br/>has been seen with other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, but to a lesser
         
 
  <br/>extent than that seen with felodipine.

  <br/>increase with age. Mean clearance of felodipine in elderly hypertensives
           
 
  <br/>(mean age 74) was only 45% of that of young volunteers (mean age 26).
           
 
  <br/>At steady-state mean AUC for young patients was 39% of that for the elderly.
           
 
  <br/>Data for intermediate age ranges suggest that the AUCs fall between the
           
 
  <br/>extremes of the young and the elderly.

                        <paragraph>Following administration of felodipine extended-release tablets, a reduction
         
 
  <br/>in blood pressure generally occurs within 2 to 5 hours. During chronic
         
 
  <br/>administration, substantial blood pressure control lasts for 24 hours, with
         
 
  <br/>trough reductions in diastolic blood pressure approximately 40% to 50% of
         
 
  <br/>peak reductions. The antihypertensive effect is dose dependent and correlates
         
 
  <br/>with the plasma concentration of felodipine.
         
 
  <br/>A reflex increase in heart rate frequently occurs during the first week of
         
 
  <br/>therapy; this increase attenuates over time. Heart rate increases of 5 to
         
 
  <br/>10 beats per minute may be seen during chronic dosing. The increase is
         
 
  <br/>inhibited by beta-blocking agents.
         
 
  <br/>The P-R interval of the ECG is not affected by felodipine when administered
         
 
  <br/>alone or in combination with a beta-blocking agent. Felodipine alone or in
         
 
  <br/>combination with a beta-blocking agent has been shown, in clinical and
         
 
  <br/>electrophysiologic studies, to have no significant effect on cardiac conduction
         
 
  <br/>(P-R, P-Q, and H-V intervals).
         
 
  <br/>In clinical trials in hypertensive patients without clinical evidence of left ventricular
         
 
  <br/>dysfunction, no symptoms suggestive of a negative inotropic effect were
         
 
  <br/>noted; however, none would be expected in this population (see PRECAUTIONS).

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Felodipine extended-release tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of
       
 
  <br/>hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the
       
 
  <br/>risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial
       
 
  <br/>infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of
       
 
  <br/>antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including
       
 
  <br/>felodipine.
       
 
  <br/>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular
       
 
  <br/>risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management,
       
 
  <br/>antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise and limited sodium intake.
       
 
  <br/>Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure
       
 
  <br/>goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines,
       
 
  <br/>such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint
       
 
  <br/>National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
       
 
  <br/>High Blood Pressure (JNC).
       
 
  <br/>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes
       
 
  <br/>and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized
       
 
  <br/>controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be
       
 
  <br/>concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic
       
 
  <br/>property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest
       
 
  <br/>and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in
       
 
  <br/>the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular
       
 
  <br/>mortality also have been seen regularly.
       
 
  <br/>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk,
       
 
  <br/>and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures,
       
 
  <br/>so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial
       
 
  <br/>benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across
       
 
  <br/>populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in
       
 
  <br/>patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example,
       
 
  <br/>patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected
       
 
  <br/>to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.
       
 
  <br/>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as
       
 
  <br/>monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have
       
 
  <br/>additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure or
       
 
  <br/>diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.
       
 
  <br/>Felodipine extended-release tablets, USP may be administered with other
       
 
  <br/>antihypertensive agents.

                        <paragraph>Hypotension
         
 
  <br/>Felodipine, like other calcium antagonists, may occasionally precipitate
         
 
  <br/>significant hypotension and, rarely, syncope. It may lead to reflex tachycardia
         
 
  <br/>which in susceptible individuals may precipitate angina pectoris. (See
         
 
  <br/>ADVERSE REACTIONS.)
         
 
  <br/>Heart Failure
         
 
  <br/>Although acute hemodynamic studies in a small number of patients with
         
 
  <br/>NYHA Class II or III heart failure treated with felodipine have not demonstrated
         
 
  <br/>negative inotropic effects, safety in patients with heart failure has not
         
 
  <br/>been established. Caution, therefore, should be exercised when using
         
 
  <br/>ffelodipine extended-release tablets in patients with heart failure or compromised
         
 
  <br/>ventricular function, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker.
         
 
  <br/>Patients with Impaired Liver Function
         
 
  <br/>Patients with impaired liver function may have elevated plasma concentrations
         
 
  <br/>of felodipine and may respond to lower doses of felodipine extended-release
         
 
  <br/>tablets; therefore, a starting dose of 2.5 mg once a day is recommended.
         
 
  <br/>These patients should have their blood pressure monitored closely during
         
 
  <br/>dosage adjustment of felodipine extended-release tablets. (See CLINICAL
         
 
  <br/>PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
         
 
  <br/>Peripheral Edema
         
 
  <br/>Peripheral edema, generally mild and not associated with generalized fluid
         
 
  <br/>retention, was the most common adverse event in the clinical trials. The
         
 
  <br/>incidence of peripheral edema was both dose and age dependent. Frequency
         
 
  <br/>of peripheral edema ranged from about 10% in patients under 50 years of
         
 
  <br/>age taking 5 mg daily to about 30% in those over 60 years of age taking 20
         
 
  <br/>mg daily. This adverse effect generally occurs within 2 to 3 weeks of the
         
 
  <br/>initiation of treatment.

                        <paragraph>CYP3A4 Inhibitors
         
 
  <br/>Felodipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of CYP3A4 inhibitors
         
 
  <br/>(e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, cimetidine)
         
 
  <br/>with felodipine may lead to several-fold increases in the plasma levels of
         
 
  <br/>felodipine, either due to an increase in bioavailability or due to a decrease in
         
 
  <br/>metabolism. These increases in concentration may lead to increased effects,
         
 
  <br/>(lower blood pressure and increased heart rate). These effects have been
         
 
  <br/>observed with coadministration of itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor).
         
 
  <br/>Caution should be used when CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with
         
 
  <br/>felodipine. A conservative approach to dosing felodipine should be taken. The
         
 
  <br/>following specific interactions have been reported:

                           <br/>Coadministration of felodipine with cimetidine (a non-specific CYP-450 inhibitor)
         
 
  <br/>resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the AUC and the Cmax, of
         
 
  <br/>felodipine.
         
 
  <br/>Beta-Blocking Agents
         
 
  <br/>A pharmacokinetic study of felodipine in conjunction with metoprolol demonstrated
         
 
  <br/>no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of felodipine. The AUC and
         
 
  <br/>Cmax of metoprolol, however, were increased approximately 31 and 38%,
         
 
  <br/>respectively. In controlled clinical trials, however, beta-blockers including
         
 
  <br/>metoprolol were concurrently administered with felodipine and were well
         
 
  <br/>tolerated.
         
 
  <br/>Digoxin
         
 
  <br/>When given concomitantly with felodipine extended-release tablets the
         
 
  <br/>pharmacokinetics of digoxin in patients with heart failure were not significantly
         
 
  <br/>altered.
         
 
  <br/>Anticonvulsants
         
 
  <br/>In a pharmacokinetic study, maximum plasma concentrations of felodipine
         
 
  <br/>were considerably lower in epileptic patients on long-term anticonvulsant
         
 
  <br/>therapy (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital) than in healthy
         
 
  <br/>volunteers. In such patients, the mean area under the felodipine plasma
         
 
  <br/>concentration-time curve was also reduced to approximately 6% of that
         
 
  <br/>observed in healthy volunteers. Since a clinically significant interaction may
         
 
  <br/>be anticipated, alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in
         
 
  <br/>these patients.
         
 
  <br/>Tacrolimus
         
 
  <br/>Felodipine may increase the blood concentration of tacrolimus. When given
         
 
  <br/>concomitantly with felodipine, the tacrolimus blood concentration should be
         
 
  <br/>followed and the tacrolimus dose may need to be adjusted.
         
 
  <br/>Other Concomitant Therapy
         
 
  <br/>In healthy subjects there were no clinically significant interactions when
         
 
  <br/>felodipine was given concomitantly with indomethacin or spironolactone.

  <br/>or 69.3 mg/kg/day (up to 61 times** the maximum recommended human dose
         
 
  <br/>on a mg/m2 basis), a dose related increase in the incidence of benign
         
 
  <br/>interstitial cell tumors of the testes (Leydig cell tumors) was observed in
         
 
  <br/>treated male rats. These tumors were not observed in a similar study in mice
         
 
  <br/>at doses up to 138.6 mg/kg/day (61 times** the maximum recommended
         
 
  <br/>human dose on a mg/m2 basis). Felodipine, at the doses employed in the 2
         
 
  <br/>year rat study, has been shown to lower testicular testosterone and to produce
         
 
  <br/>a corresponding increase in serum luteinizing hormone in rats. The Leydig
         
 
  <br/>cell tumor development is possibly secondary to these hormonal effects
         
 
  <br/>which have not been observed in man.
         
 
  <br/>In this same rat study a dose related increase in the incidence of focal
         
 
  <br/>squamous cell hyperplasia compared to control was observed in the esophageal
         
 
  <br/>groove of male and female rats in all dose groups. No other drug-related
         
 
  <br/>esophageal or gastric pathology was observed in the rats or with chronic
         
 
  <br/>administration in mice and dogs. The latter species, like man, has no anatomical
         
 
  <br/>structure comparable to the esophageal groove.
         
 
  <br/>Felodipine was not carcinogenic when fed to mice at doses up to 138.6 mg/kg/day
         
 
  <br/>(61 times** the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis) for
         
 
  <br/>periods of up to 80 weeks in males and 99 weeks in females.
         
 
  <br/>Felodipine did not display any mutagenic activity in vitro in the Ames
         
 
  <br/>microbial mutagenicity test or in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation
         
 
  <br/>assay. No clastogenic potential was seen in vivo in the mouse micronucleus
         
 
  <br/>test at oral doses up to 2500 mg/kg (1,100 times** the maximum recommended
         
 
  <br/>human dose on a mg/m2 basis) or in vitro in a human lymphocyte chromosome
         
 
  <br/>aberration assay.
         
 
  <br/>A fertility study in which male and female rats were administered doses of
         
 
  <br/>3.8, 9.6 or 26.9 mg/kg/day (up to 24 times** the maximum recommended
         
 
  <br/>human dose on a mg/m2 basis) showed no significant effect of felodipine on
         
 
  <br/>reproductive performance.

                        <paragraph>Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C
         
 
  <br/>Studies in pregnant rabbits administered doses of 0.46, 1.2, 2.3 and 4.6 mg/kg/day
         
 
  <br/>(from 0.8 to 8 times** the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2
         
 
  <br/>basis) showed digital anomalies consisting of reduction in size and degree
         
 
  <br/>of ossification of the terminal phalanges in the fetuses. The frequency and
         
 
  <br/>severity of the changes appeared dose related and were noted even at the
         
 
  <br/>lowest dose. These changes have been shown to occur with other members
         
 
  <br/>of the dihydropyridine class and are possibly a result of compromised uterine
         
 
  <br/>blood flow. Similar fetal anomalies were not observed in rats given felodipine.
         
 
  <br/>In a teratology study in cynomolgus monkeys, no reduction in the size of the
         
 
  <br/>terminal phalanges was observed, but an abnormal position of the distal
         
 
  <br/>phalanges was noted in about 40% of the fetuses.
         
 
  <br/>Nonteratogenic Effects
         
 
  <br/>A prolongation of parturition with difficult labor and an increased frequency
         
 
  <br/>of fetal and early postnatal deaths were observed in rats administered doses
         
 
  <br/>of 9.6 mg/kg/day (8 times** the maximum human dose on a mg/m2 basis) and
         
 
  <br/>above.
         
 
  <br/>**Based on patient weight of 50 kg
         
 
  <br/>Significant enlargement of the mammary glands, in excess of the normal
         
 
  <br/>enlargement for pregnant rabbits, was found with doses greater than or equal
         
 
  <br/>to 1.2 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the maximum human dose on a mg/m2 basis).
         
 
  <br/>This effect occurred only in pregnant rabbits and regressed during lactation.
         
 
  <br/>Similar changes in the mammary glands were not observed in rats or
         
 
  <br/>monkeys.
         
 
  <br/>There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. If
         
 
  <br/>felodipine extended-release tablet is used during pregnancy, or if the
         
 
  <br/>patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, she should be apprised
         
 
  <br/>of the potential hazard to the fetus, possible digital anomalies of the infant,
         
 
  <br/>and the potential effects of felodipine on labor and delivery and on the
         
 
  <br/>mammary glands of pregnant females.

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies of felodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects
         
 
  <br/>aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger
         
 
  <br/>subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in
         
 
  <br/>responses between the elderly and younger patients. Pharmacokinetics,

               <text>
                  <paragraph>In controlled studies in the United States and overseas, approximately 3,000
       
 
  <br/>patients were treated with felodipine as either the extended-release or the
       
 
  <br/>immediate-release formulation.
       
 
  <br/>The most common clinical adverse events reported with felodipine extendedrelease
       
 
  <br/>tablets administered as monotherapy at the recommended dosage
       
 
  <br/>range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day were peripheral edema and headache.
       
 
  <br/>Peripheral edema was generally mild, but it was age and dose related and
       
 
  <br/>resulted in discontinuation of therapy in about 3% of the enrolled patients.
       
 
  <br/>Discontinuation of therapy due to any clinical adverse event occurred in
       
 
  <br/>about 6% of the patients receiving felodipine extended-release tablets,

  <br/>Adverse events that occurred with an incidence of 1.5% or greater at any of
       
 
  <br/>the recommended doses of 2.5 mg to 10 mg once a day (felodipine extendedrelease
       
 
  <br/>tablets, N = 861; Placebo, N = 334), without regard to causality, are

  <br/>evaluated in some clinical studies. Although the antihypertensive effect of
       
 
  <br/>felodipine extended-release tablets is increased at 20 mg once a day,
       
 
  <br/>there is a disproportionate increase in adverse events, especially those

  <br/>blood pressure and heart rate were normal on admission to hospital; he
       
 
  <br/>subsequently recovered without significant sequelae.
       
 
  <br/>Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation
       
 
  <br/>with marked hypotension and possibly bradycardia.
       
 
  <br/>If severe hypotension occurs, symptomatic treatment should be instituted.
       
 
  <br/>The patient should be placed supine with the legs elevated. The administration
       
 
  <br/>of intravenous fluids may be useful to treat hypotension due to overdosage
       
 
  <br/>with calcium antagonists. In case of accompanying bradycardia, atropine
       
 
  <br/>(0.5 mg to 1 mg) should be administered intravenously. Sympathomimetic
       
 
  <br/>drugs may also be given if the physician feels they are warranted.
       
 
  <br/>It has not been established whether felodipine can be removed from the
       
 
  <br/>circulation by hemodialysis.
       
 
  <br/>To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, consult
       
 
  <br/>your Regional Poison-Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poisoncontrol
       
 
  <br/>centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing
       
 
  <br/>overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug
       
 
  <br/>interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. Depending on the patient's
       
 
  <br/>response, the dosage can be decreased to 2.5 mg or increased to 10 mg
       
 
  <br/>once a day. These adjustments should occur generally at intervals of not less
       
 
  <br/>than 2 weeks. The recommended dosage range is 2.5 mg to 10 mg once
       
 
  <br/>daily. In clinical trials, doses above 10 mg daily showed an increased blood
       
 
  <br/>pressure response but a large increase in the rate of peripheral edema and
       
 
  <br/>other vasodilatory adverse events (see 
       
 
  <content styleCode="underline">ADVERSE REACTIONS</content>). Modification
       
 
  <br/>of the recommended dosage is usually not required in patients with renal
       
 
  <br/>impairment.
       
 
  <br/>Felodipine extended-release tablets should regularly be taken either without
       
 
  <br/>food or with a light meal (see 
       
 
  <content styleCode="underline">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics</content>
                     <br/>
                     <content styleCode="underline">and Metabolism</content>). Felodipine extended-release tablets should be swallowed
       
 
  <br/>whole and not crushed or chewed.

                        <paragraph>Patients over 65 years of age are likely to develop higher plasma concentrations
         
 
  <br/>of felodipine (see 
         
 
  <content styleCode="underline">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</content>). In general, dose selection
         
 
  <br/>for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the
         
 
  <br/>dosing range (2.5 mg daily). Elderly patients should have their blood pressure
         
 
  <br/>closely monitored during any dosage adjustment.
