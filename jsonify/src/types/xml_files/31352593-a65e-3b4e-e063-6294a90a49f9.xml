                        <paragraph>The recommended dose of paliperidone extended-release tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults is 6 mg administered once daily. Initial dose titration is not required. Although it has not been systematically established that doses above 6 mg have additional benefit, there was a general trend for greater effects with higher doses. This must be weighed against the dose-related increase in adverse reactions. Thus, some patients may benefit from higher doses, up to 12 mg/day, and for some patients, a lower dose of 3 mg/day may be sufficient. Dose increases above 6 mg/day should be made only after clinical reassessment and generally should occur at intervals of more than 5 days. When dose increases are indicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended. The maximum recommended dose is 12 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a longer-term study, paliperidone extended-release tablets have been shown to be effective in delaying time to relapse in patients with schizophrenia who were stabilized on paliperidone extended-release tablets for 6 weeks

  </content>Paliperidone extended-release tablets should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for maintaining clinical stability and the physician should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug in individual patients.

                        <paragraph>The recommended starting dose of paliperidone extended-release tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age is 3 mg administered once daily. Initial dose titration is not required. Dose increases, if considered necessary, should be made only after clinical reassessment and should occur at increments of 3 mg/day at intervals of more than 5 days. Prescribers should be mindful that, in the adolescent schizophrenia study, there was no clear enhancement to efficacy at the higher doses, i.e., 6 mg for subjects weighing less than 51 kg and 12 mg for subjects weighing 51 kg or greater, while adverse events were dose-related.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dosing must be individualized according to the patient’s renal function status. For patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min to &lt; 80 mL/min), the recommended initial dose of paliperidone extended-release tablets is 3 mg once daily. The dose may then be increased to a maximum of 6 mg once daily based on clinical response and tolerability. For patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥ 10 mL/min to &lt; 50 mL/min), the recommended initial dose of paliperidone extended-release tablets is 1.5 mg once daily, which may be increased to a maximum of 3 mg once daily after clinical reassessment. As paliperidone extended-release tablets have not been studied in patients with creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min, use is not recommended in such patients

                     <title>5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Paliperidone is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs, including paliperidone. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4 QT Prolongation</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Paliperidone causes a modest increase in the corrected QT (QTc) interval. The use of paliperidone should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Paliperidone should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effects of paliperidone on the QT interval were evaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg single dose), multicenter QT study in adults with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and in three placebo- and active-controlled 6-week, fixed-dose efficacy trials in adults with schizophrenia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the QT study (n = 141), the 8 mg dose of immediate-release oral paliperidone (n=50) showed a mean placebo-subtracted increase from baseline in QTcLD of 12.3 msec (90% CI: 8.9; 15.6) on day 8 at 1.5 hours post-dose. The mean steady-state peak plasma concentration for this 8 mg dose of paliperidone immediate-release was more than twice the exposure observed with the maximum recommended 12 mg dose of paliperidone (C
 
  <sub>max ss</sub>= 113 ng/mL and 45 ng/mL, respectively, when administered with a standard breakfast). In this same study, a 4 mg dose of the immediate-release oral formulation of paliperidone, for which C
 
  <sub>max ss</sub>= 35 ng/mL, showed an increased placebo-subtracted QTcLD of 6.8 msec (90% CI: 3.6; 10.1) on day 2 at 1.5 hours post-dose. None of the subjects had a change exceeding 60 msec or a QTcLD exceeding 500 msec at any time during this study.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For the three fixed-dose efficacy studies in subjects with schizophrenia, electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements taken at various time points showed only one subject in the paliperidone 12 mg group had a change exceeding 60 msec at one time-point on Day 6 (increase of 62 msec).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No subject receiving paliperidone had a QTcLD exceeding 500 msec at any time in any of these three studies.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase with duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Given these considerations, paliperidone should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on paliperidone, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with paliperidone despite the presence of the syndrome.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.6 Metabolic Changes</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with all atypical antipsychotics. These cases were, for the most part, seen in post-marketing clinical use and epidemiologic studies, not in clinical trials, and there have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in trial subjects treated with paliperidone. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Because paliperidone was not marketed at the time these studies were performed, it is not known if paliperidone is associated with this increased risk.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</paragraph>

When treating adolescent patients with paliperidone, weight gain should be assessed against that expected with normal growth. When taking into consideration the median duration of exposure to paliperidone in the open-label study (182 days) along with expected normal growth in this population based on age and gender, an assessment of standardized scores relative to normative data provides a more clinically relevant measure of changes in weight. The mean change from open-label baseline to endpoint in standardized score for weight was 0.1 (4% above the median for normative data). Based on comparison to the normative data, these changes are not considered to be clinically significant.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D
 
  <sub>2</sub>receptors, paliperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Paliperidone has a prolactin-elevating effect similar to that seen with risperidone, a drug that is associated with higher levels of prolactin than other antipsychotic drugs.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in the incidence of pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats

                        <paragraph>Because the paliperidone extended-release tablet is non-deformable and does not appreciably change in shape in the gastrointestinal tract, paliperidone should ordinarily not be administered to patients with pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic, for example: esophageal motility disorders, small bowel inflammatory disease, “short gut” syndrome due to adhesions or decreased transit time, past history of peritonitis, cystic fibrosis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, or Meckel’s diverticulum). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of drugs in non-deformable controlled-release formulations. Because of the controlled-release design of the tablet, paliperidone should only be used in patients who are able to swallow the tablet whole

                        <paragraph>Paliperidone can induce orthostatic hypotension and syncope in some patients because of its alpha-blocking activity. In pooled results of the three placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose trials in subjects with schizophrenia, syncope was reported in 0.8% (7/850) of subjects treated with paliperidone (3 mg, 6 mg, 9 mg, 12 mg) compared to 0.3% (1/355) of subjects treated with placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Paliperidone should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimer’s dementia. Paliperidone and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Disruption of the body’s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing paliperidone to patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia (reported in 5% or more of subjects treated with paliperidone and at least twice the placebo rate in any of the dose groups) were extrapyramidal symptoms, tachycardia, and akathisia. The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials in adult patients with schizoaffective disorder (reported in 5% or more of subjects treated with paliperidone and at least twice the placebo rate) were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, dyspepsia, constipation, weight increased, and nasopharyngitis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation from clinical trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia (causing discontinuation in 2% of paliperidone-treated subjects) were nervous system disorders. The most common adverse reactions that were associated with discontinuation from clinical trials in adult subjects with schizoaffective disorder were gastrointestinal disorders, which resulted in discontinuation in 1% of paliperidone-treated subjects

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of paliperidone was evaluated in 1205 adult subjects with schizophrenia who participated in three placebo-controlled, 6-week, double-blind trials, of whom 850 subjects received paliperidone at fixed doses ranging from 3 mg to 12 mg once daily. The information presented in this section was derived from pooled data from these three trials. Additional safety information from the placebo-controlled phase of the long-term maintenance study, in which subjects received paliperidone at daily doses within the range of 3 mg to 15 mg (n=104), is also included.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of paliperidone was evaluated in 150 adolescent subjects 12 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia who received paliperidone in the dose range of 1.5 mg to 12 mg/day in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of paliperidone was also evaluated in 622 adult subjects with schizoaffective disorder who participated in two placebo-controlled, 6-week, double-blind trials. In one of these trials, 206 subjects were assigned to one of two dose levels of paliperidone: 6 mg with the option to reduce to 3 mg (n = 108) or 12 mg with the option to reduce to 9 mg (n = 98) once daily. In the other study, 214 subjects received flexible doses of paliperidone (3 to 12 mg once daily). Both studies included subjects who received paliperidone either as monotherapy or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants. Adverse events during exposure to study treatment were obtained by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. Consequently, to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Throughout this section, adverse reactions are reported. Adverse reactions are adverse events that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of paliperidone (adverse drug reactions) based on the comprehensive assessment of the available adverse event information. A causal association for paliperidone often cannot be reliably established in individual cases. Further, because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</paragraph>

                           <sup>*</sup>Table includes adverse reactions that were reported in 2% or more of subjects in any of the paliperidone dose groups and which occurred at greater incidence than in the placebo group. Data are pooled from two studies. One study included once-daily paliperidone doses of 6 mg (with the option to reduce to 3 mg) and 12 mg (with the option to reduce to 9 mg). The second study included flexible once-daily doses of 3 to 12 mg. Among the 420 subjects treated with paliperidone, 230 (55%) received paliperidone as monotherapy and 190 (45%) received paliperidone as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants. Extrapyramidal symptoms includes the terms bradykinesia, drooling, dyskinesia, dystonia, hypertonia, muscle rigidity, muscle twitching, oculogyration, parkinsonian gait, parkinsonism, restlessness, and tremor. Somnolence includes the terms sedation and somnolence. Tachycardia includes the terms tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, and heart rate increased.

                        <paragraph>The designs of the two placebo-controlled, 6-week, double-blind trials in adult subjects with schizoaffective disorder included the option for subjects to receive antidepressants (except monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and/or mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, or lamotrigine). In the subject population evaluated for safety, 230 (55%) subjects received paliperidone as monotherapy and 190 (45%) subjects received paliperidone as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants. When comparing these 2 subpopulations, only nausea occurred at a greater frequency (≥ 3% difference) in subjects receiving paliperidone as monotherapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pooled data from the three placebo-controlled, 6-week, fixed-dose studies in adult subjects with schizophrenia provided information regarding treatment-emergent EPS. Several methods were used to measure EPS: (1) the Simpson-Angus global score (mean change from baseline) which broadly evaluates Parkinsonism, (2) the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale global clinical rating score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates akathisia, (3) use of anticholinergic medications to treat emergent EPS
 
  <content styleCode="italics">(Table 7)</content>, and (4) incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS
 
  <content styleCode="italics">(Table 8)</content>. For the Simpson-Angus Scale, spontaneous EPS reports and use of anticholinergic medications, there was a dose-related increase observed for the 9 mg and 12 mg doses. There was no difference observed between placebo and paliperidone 3 mg and 6 mg doses for any of these EPS measures.

For subjects with schizoaffective disorder, there was no dose-related increase in EPS observed for parkinsonism with the Simpson-Angus scale or akathisia with the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. There was a dose-related increase observed with spontaneous EPS reports of hyperkinesia and dystonia and in the use of anticholinergic medications.</paragraph>

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

Similarly, there were no differences between paliperidone and placebo in the incidence of discontinuations due to changes in hematology, urinalysis, or serum chemistry, including mean changes from baseline in fasting glucose, insulin, c-peptide, triglyceride, HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol measurements. However, paliperidone was associated with increases in serum prolactin

                        <paragraph>Paliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes.
 
  <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>studies in human liver microsomes showed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. Therefore, paliperidone is not expected to inhibit clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner. Paliperidone is also not expected to have enzyme inducing properties.

                        <paragraph>Paliperidone is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, so that an interaction with inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes is unlikely. While
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone metabolism,
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content>studies do not show decreased elimination by these isozymes and they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance.
 
  <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Co-administration of paliperidone 6 mg once daily with carbamazepine, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), at 200 mg twice daily caused a decrease of approximately 37% in the mean steady-state C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and AUC of paliperidone. This decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone. A minor decrease in the amount of drug excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP metabolism or bioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration. On initiation of carbamazepine, the dose of paliperidone should be re-evaluated and increased if necessary. Conversely, on discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose of paliperidone should be re-evaluated and decreased if necessary.

  </content>. In an interaction study in healthy subjects in which a single 3 mg dose of paliperidone was administered concomitantly with 20 mg per day of paroxetine (a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor), paliperidone exposures were on average 16% (90% CI: 4, 30) higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. Higher doses of paroxetine have not been studied. The clinical relevance is unknown.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Co-administration of a single dose of paliperidone 12 mg with divalproex sodium extended-release tablets (two 500 mg tablets once daily) resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and AUC of paliperidone. Dosage reduction for paliperidone should be considered when paliperidone is co-administered with valproate after clinical assessment.

                        <paragraph>In a study in which juvenile rats were treated with oral paliperidone from days 24 to 73 of age, a reversible impairment of performance in a test of learning and memory was seen, in females only, with a no-effect dose of 0.63 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels (AUC) of paliperidone similar to those in adolescents at MRHD of 12 mg/day. No other consistent effects on neurobehavioral or reproductive development were seen up to the highest dose tested (2.5 mg/kg/day), which produced plasma levels of paliperidone 2 to 3 times those in adolescents.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Juvenile dogs were treated for 40 weeks with oral risperidone, which is extensively metabolized to paliperidone in animals and humans, at doses of 0.31, 1.25, or 5 mg/kg/day. Decreased bone length and density were seen with a no-effect dose of 0.31 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma levels (AUC) of risperidone plus paliperidone which were similar to those in children and adolescents receiving the MRHD of risperidone. In addition, a delay in sexual maturation was seen at all doses in both males and females. The above effects showed little or no reversibility in females after a 12-week drug-free recovery period.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>There is no specific antidote to paliperidone, therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be instituted and close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. Consideration should be given to the extended-release nature of the product when assessing treatment needs and recovery. Multiple drug involvement should also be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In case of acute overdose, establish and maintain an airway and ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The possibility of obtundation, seizures, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately, including continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QT-prolonging effects when administered in patients with an acute overdose of paliperidone. Similarly, the alpha-blocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of paliperidone, resulting in problematic hypotension.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures, such as intravenous fluids and/or sympathomimetic agents (epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation may worsen hypotension in the setting of paliperidone-induced alpha blockade). In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action of paliperidone in schizophrenia is unclear. However, the drug's therapeutic effect in schizophrenia could be mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D
 
  <sub>2</sub>) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT
 
  <sub>2A</sub>) receptor antagonism.

  <sub>max</sub>) approximately 24 hours after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of paliperidone following paliperidone administration are dose-proportional within the available dose range. The terminal elimination half-life of paliperidone is approximately 23 hours.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Steady-state concentrations of paliperidone are attained within 4 to 5 days of dosing with paliperidone in most subjects. The mean steady-state peak:trough ratio for a paliperidone dose of 9 mg was 1.7 with a range of 1.2 to 3.1.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following administration of paliperidone, the (+) and (-) enantiomers of paliperidone interconvert, reaching an AUC (+) to (-) ratio of approximately 1.6 at steady-state.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The absolute oral bioavailability of paliperidone following paliperidone extended-release tablet administration is 28%.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Administration of a 12 mg paliperidone extended-release tablet to healthy ambulatory subjects with a standard high-fat/high-caloric meal gave mean C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and AUC values of paliperidone that were increased by 60% and 54%, respectively, compared with administration under fasting conditions. Clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of paliperidone were carried out in subjects without regard to the timing of meals. While paliperidone extended-release tablets can be taken without regard to food, the presence of food at the time of paliperidone extended-release tablet administration may increase exposure to paliperidone

  </content>. The disposition of a single dose paliperidone 3 mg extended-release tablet was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Elimination of paliperidone decreased with decreasing estimated creatinine clearance. Total clearance of paliperidone was reduced in subjects with impaired renal function by 32% on average in mild (CrCl = 50 mL/min to &lt; 80 mL/min), 64% in moderate (CrCl = 30 mL/min to &lt; 50 mL/min), and 71% in severe (CrCl = 10 mL/min to &lt; 30 mL/min) renal impairment, corresponding to an average increase in exposure (AUC
 
  <sub>inf</sub>) of 1.5 fold, 2.6 fold, and 4.8 fold, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The mean terminal elimination half-life of paliperidone was 24 hours, 40 hours, and 51 hours in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with 23 hours in subjects with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min).

There were statistically significant increases in pituitary gland adenomas, endocrine pancreas adenomas, and mammary gland adenocarcinomas. The no-effect dose for these tumors was less than or equal to the MRHD of risperidone based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>body surface area (see risperidone package insert). An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be mediated by prolonged dopamine D

                        <paragraph>In a study of fertility, the percentage of treated female rats that became pregnant was not affected at oral doses of paliperidone of up to 2.5 mg/kg/day which is 2 times the MRHD based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>body surface area. However, pre- and post-implantation loss was increased, and the number of live embryos was slightly decreased, at 2.5 mg/kg, a dose that also caused slight maternal toxicity. These parameters were not affected at a dose of 0.63 mg/kg, which is half of the MRHD based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2 </sup>body surface area.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The fertility of male rats was not affected at oral doses of paliperidone of up to 2 times the MRHD of 12 mg/day based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>body surface area, although sperm count and sperm viability studies were not conducted with paliperidone. In a subchronic study in Beagle dogs with risperidone, which is extensively converted to paliperidone in dogs and humans, all doses tested (0.31 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg) resulted in decreases in serum testosterone and in sperm motility and concentration (0.6 to 10 times the MRHD of 16 mg/day for risperidone, based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>body surface area). Serum testosterone and sperm parameters partially recovered, but remained decreased after the last observation (two months after treatment was discontinued).

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Adults</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The acute efficacy of paliperidone (3 mg to 15 mg once daily) was established in three placebo-controlled and active-controlled (olanzapine), 6-week, fixed-dose trials in non-elderly adult subjects (mean age of 37) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Studies were carried out in North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Asia. The doses studied among these three trials included 3 mg/day, 6 mg/day, 9 mg/day, 12 mg/day, and 15 mg/day. Dosing was in the morning without regard to meals.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy was evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a validated multi-item inventory composed of five factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. Efficacy was also evaluated using the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale. The PSP is a validated clinician-rated scale that measures personal and social functioning in the domains of socially useful activities (e.g., work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In all 3 studies (n = 1665), paliperidone was superior to placebo on the PANSS at all doses. Mean effects at all doses were fairly similar, although the higher doses in all studies were numerically superior. Paliperidone was also superior to placebo on the PSP in these trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of gender, age (there were few patients over 65), or geographic region. There were insufficient data to explore differential effects based on race.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a longer-term trial, adult outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who had clinically responded (defined as PANSS score ≤ 70 or ≤ 4 on pre-defined PANSS subscales, as well as having been on a stable fixed dose of paliperidone for the last two weeks of an 8-week run-in phase) were entered into a 6-week open-label stabilization phase where they received paliperidone (doses ranging from 3 mg to 15 mg once daily). After the stabilization phase, patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to either continue on paliperidone at their achieved stable dose, or to placebo, until they experienced a relapse of schizophrenia symptoms. Relapse was pre-defined as significant increase in PANSS (or pre-defined PANSS subscales), hospitalization, clinically significant suicidal or homicidal ideation, or deliberate injury to self or others. An interim analysis of the data showed a significantly longer time to relapse in patients treated with paliperidone compared to placebo, and the trial was stopped early because maintenance of efficacy was demonstrated.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of paliperidone in adolescent subjects with schizophrenia was established in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 6-week study using a fixed-dose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 1.5 to 12 mg/day. The study was carried out in the US, India, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine, and involved subjects 12 to 17 years of age meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, with diagnosis confirmation using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: a placebo group or paliperidone Low, Medium, or High dose groups. Doses were administered based on body weight to minimize the risk of exposing lower-weight adolescents to high doses of paliperidone. Subjects weighing between 29 kg and less than 51 kg at the baseline visit were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1.5 mg (Low dose), 3 mg (Medium dose), or 6 mg (High dose) of paliperidone daily, and subjects weighing at least 51 kg at the baseline visit were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1.5 mg (Low dose), 6 mg (Medium dose), or 12 mg (High dose) of paliperidone daily. Dosing was in the morning without regard to meals.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy was evaluated using PANSS. Overall, this study demonstrated the efficacy of paliperidone in adolescents with schizophrenia in the dose range of 3 to 12 mg/day. Doses within this broad range were shown to be effective, however, there was no clear enhancement to efficacy at the higher doses, i.e., 6 mg for subjects weighing less than 51 kg and 12 mg for subjects weighing 51 kg or greater. Although paliperidone was adequately tolerated within the dose range of 3 to 12 mg/day, adverse events were dose related.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Adults</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The acute efficacy of paliperidone (3 mg to 12 mg once daily) in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder was established in two placebo-controlled, 6‑week trials in non-elderly adult subjects. Enrolled subjects 1) met DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder, as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders, 2) had a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score of at least 60, and 3) had prominent mood symptoms as confirmed by a score of at least 16 on the Young Mania Rating Scale and/or Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. The population included subjects with schizoaffective bipolar and depressive types. In one of these trials, efficacy was assessed in 211 subjects who received flexible doses of paliperidone (3 to 12 mg once daily). In the other study, efficacy was assessed in 203 subjects who were assigned to one of two dose levels of paliperidone: 6 mg with the option to reduce to 3 mg (n = 105) or 12 mg with the option to reduce to 9 mg (n = 98) once daily. Both studies included subjects who received paliperidone either as monotherapy [no mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants (55%)] or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants (45%). The most commonly used mood stabilizers were valproate and lithium. The most commonly used antidepressants were SSRIs and SNRIs. Paliperidone was dosed in the morning without regard to meals. Studies were carried out in the United States, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Asia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy was evaluated using the PANSS, a validated multi-item inventory composed of five factors to evaluate positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized thoughts, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression. As secondary outcomes, mood symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-21) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The paliperidone group in the flexible-dose study (dosed between 3 and 12 mg/day, mean modal dose of 8.6 mg/day) and the higher dose group of paliperidone in the 2 dose-level study (12 mg/day with option to reduce to 9 mg/day) were each superior to placebo in the PANSS. Numerical improvements in mood symptoms were also observed, as measured by the HAM-D-21 and YMRS. In the lower dose group of the 2 dose-level study (6 mg/day with option to reduce to 3 mg/day), paliperidone was not significantly different from placebo as measured by the PANSS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Taking the results of both studies together, paliperidone improved the symptoms of schizoaffective disorder at endpoint relative to placebo when administered either as monotherapy or as an adjunct to mood stabilizers and/or antidepressants. An examination of population subgroups did not reveal any evidence of differential responsiveness on the basis of gender, age, or geographic region. There were insufficient data to explore differential effects based on race.</paragraph>
