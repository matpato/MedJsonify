Further dose escalations should be based on tolerability and need for efficacy. The recommended maximum total daily dose is 3 mg/day in patients receiving regular dialysis. Supplemental doses after dialysis are not required. The use of ropinirole in patients with severe renal impairment without regular dialysis has not been studied.

                     </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients treated with ropinirole have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole, some perceived that they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials, somnolence was commonly reported in patients receiving ropinirole and was more frequent in Parkinson's disease (up to 40% ropinirole, 6% placebo) than in RLS (12% ropinirole, 6% placebo)
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Before initiating treatment with ropinirole, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole such as concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders (other than RLS), and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin)
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</content>. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole should ordinarily be discontinued
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]</content>. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association with treatment with ropinirole in both patients with Parkinson’s disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinson’s disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving ropinirole than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson’s disease without levodopa [L-dopa]: ropinirole 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinson’s disease: ropinirole 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with ropinirole for RLS in 12 week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole, and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because the trials conducted with ropinirole excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinson’s disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1 mg dose of ropinirole. In 2 trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with ropinirole compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients with Parkinson’s disease may have impaired ability to respond normally to a fall in blood pressure after standing from lying down or seated position. Patients on ropinirole should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</content>.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinson’s disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with ropinirole. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 12 week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with ropinirole compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 2 Phase 2 trials in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving ropinirole experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these trials, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving ropinirole and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo, experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Phase 1 trials of ropinirole with healthy volunteers who received single doses on more than one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinson’s disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</content>.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving ropinirole and was more frequent in patients with Parkinson’s disease or with RLS receiving ropinirole than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinson’s disease without L-dopa: ropinirole 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinson’s disease: ropinirole 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: ropinirole 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of ropinirole was 4% in patients with early Parkinson’s disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease, and 1% in patients with RLS

                        <paragraph>In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinson’s disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole and L-dopa in advanced Parkinson’s disease trials, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa.</paragraph>

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Postmarketing reports indicate that patients with Parkinson’s disease or RLS may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease or RLS can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, symptoms of mania (e.g., insomnia, psychomotor agitation), disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole [

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole, that increase central dopaminergic tone. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole for Parkinson’s disease or RLS. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Augmentation is a phenomenon in which dopaminergic medication causes a worsening of symptom severity above and beyond the level at the time the medication was started. The symptoms of augmentation may include the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Augmentation has been described during therapy for RLS. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial of ropinirole. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of ropinirole should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. When discontinuing ropinirole in patients with RLS, gradual reduction of the daily dose is recommended whenever possible

  <sup>2</sup>basis. Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3 month study in pigmented rats, in a 2 year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1 year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding).

                           <br/>  During the premarketing development of ropinirole, patients received ropinirole either without L-dopa (early Parkinson's disease trials) or as concomitant therapy with L-dopa (advanced Parkinson's disease trials). Because these 2 populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will in general present adverse reaction data for these 2 populations separately.

                           <br/>  In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were nausea, somnolence, dizziness, syncope, asthenic condition (i.e., asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise), viral infection, leg edema, vomiting, and dyspepsia.

The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation were nausea and dizziness.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with early Parkinson's disease (without L-dopa) treated with ropinirole participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either ropinirole or placebo was used as early therapy (i.e., without L-dopa).</paragraph>

                           <br/>  In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole (incidence at least 5 % greater than placebo) were dyskinesia, somnolence, nausea, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, increased sweating, and headache.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 24% of patients who received ropinirole in the double-blind, placebo-controlled advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 18% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with ropinirole (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation was dizziness.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 4 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (with L-dopa) treated with ropinirole who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either ropinirole or placebo was used as an adjunct to L-dopa.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with RLS, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were nausea, vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, and asthenic condition (i.e., asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise).

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 5% of patients treated with ropinirole who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in the treatment of RLS discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 4% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with ropinirole (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation was nausea.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 5 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with RLS treated with ropinirole participating in the 12 week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>metabolism studies showed that cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. There is thus the potential for inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme to alter the clearance of ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole may be required. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, increases the AUC and C

                           <br/>  There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of ropinirole in pregnant women. In animal studies, ropinirole had adverse effects on development when administered to pregnant rats at doses similar to (neurobehavioral impairment) or greater than (teratogenicity and embryolethality at &gt;36 times) the MRHD for Parkinson’s disease. Ropinirole doses associated with teratogenicity and embryolethality in pregnant rats were associated with maternal toxicity. In pregnant rabbits, ropinirole potentiated the teratogenic effects of L-dopa when these drugs were administered in combination [
 
  <content styleCode="italics">see Data</content>].

                        <paragraph>
                           <br/>  In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated populations is unknown.

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Animal Data: Oral administration of ropinirole (0, 20, 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality, increased incidence of fetal malformations (digit, cardiovascular, and neural tube defects) and variations, and decreased fetal weight at the 2 highest doses. These doses were also associated with maternal toxicity. The highest no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development (90 mg/kg/day) is approximately 36 times the MRHD for Parkinson’s disease (24 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>) basis.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <br/>  No effect on embryofetal development was observed in rabbits when ropinirole was administered alone during organogenesis at oral doses of 0, 1, 5, or 20 mg/kg/day (up to 16 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). In pregnant rabbits, there was a greater incidence and severity of fetal malformations (primarily digit defects) when ropinirole (10 mg/kg/day) was administered orally during gestation in combination with L-dopa (250 mg/kg/day) than when L-dopa was administered alone. This drug combination was also associated with maternal toxicity.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of ropinirole (0, 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg/day) to rats during late gestation and continuing throughout lactation resulted in neurobehavioral impairment (decreased startle response) and decreased body weight in offspring at the highest dose. The no-effect dose of 1 mg/kg/day is less than the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis.

                        <paragraph>Clinical experience with dopamine agonists, including ropinirole, suggests an association with impaired ability to regulate blood pressure resulting in orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. In some patients in clinical trials, blood pressure changes were associated with the emergence of orthostatic symptoms, bradycardia, and, in one case in a healthy volunteer, transient sinus arrest with syncope

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism of orthostatic hypotension induced by ropinirole is presumed to be due to a D2-mediated blunting of the noradrenergic response to standing and subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.

                           <br/>  Ropinirole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak concentration in approximately 1 to 2 hours. In clinical trials, more than 88% of a radiolabeled dose was recovered in urine and the absolute bioavailability was 45% to 55%, indicating approximately 50% first-pass effect.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Relative bioavailability from a tablet compared with an oral solution is 85%. Food does not affect the extent of absorption of ropinirole, although its Tmax is increased by 2.5 hours and its Cmax is decreased by approximately 25% when the drug is taken with a high-fat meal.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  Ropinirole is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are N-despropylation and hydroxylation to form the inactive N-despropyl metabolite and hydroxy metabolites. The N-despropyl metabolite is converted to carbamyl glucuronide, carboxylic acid, and N-despropyl hydroxy metabolites. The hydroxy metabolite of ropinirole is rapidly glucuronidated.

                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>studies indicate that the major cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of ropinirole is CYP1A2, an enzyme known to be induced by smoking and omeprazole and inhibited by, for example, fluvoxamine, mexiletine, and the older fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin.

Less than 10% of the administered dose is excreted as unchanged drug in urine. N-despropyl ropinirole is the predominant metabolite found in urine (40%), followed by the carboxylic acid metabolite (10%), and the glucuronide of the hydroxy metabolite (10%).

                           <br/>  Two-year carcinogenicity studies of ropinirole were conducted in mice at oral doses of 0, 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/day and in rats at oral doses of 0, 1.5, 15, and 50 mg/kg/day.

                        <paragraph>In rats, there was an increase in testicular Leydig cell adenomas at all doses tested. The lowest dose tested (1.5 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD for Parkinson’s disease (24 mg/day) on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis. The endocrine mechanisms believed to be involved in the production of these tumors in rats are not considered relevant to humans.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In mice, there was an increase in benign uterine endometrial polyps at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The highest dose not associated with this finding (15 mg/kg/day) is 3 times the MRHD on a mg/m

                           <br/>  When administered to female rats prior to and during mating and throughout pregnancy, ropinirole caused disruption of implantation at oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day (8 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis) or greater. This effect in rats is thought to be due to the prolactin-lowering effect of ropinirole. In rat studies using a low oral dose (5 mg/kg) during the prolactin-dependent phase of early pregnancy (gestation days 0 to 8), ropinirole did not affect female fertility at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day (40 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). No effect on male fertility was observed in rats at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day (50 times the MRHD on a mg/m

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of ropinirole in the treatment of Parkinsons disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of 11 randomized, controlled trials. Four trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinsons disease and no concomitant L-dopa and 7 trials were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinsons disease with concomitant L-dopa.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Three placebo-controlled trials provide evidence of effectiveness of ropinirole in the management of patients with Parkinsons disease who were and were not receiving concomitant L-dopa. Two of these 3 trials enrolled patients with early Parkinsons disease (without L-dopa) and 1 enrolled patients receiving L-dopa.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these trials a variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g., Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scores, patient diaries recording time "on" and "off", tolerability of L-dopa dose reductions).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In both trials of patients with early Parkinsons disease (without L-dopa), the motor component (Part III) of the UPDRS was the primary outcome assessment. The UPDRS is a multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor performance (Part III), and complications of therapy (Part IV). Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 items designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinsons disease (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) scored for different body regions and has a maximum (worst) score of 108. In the trial of patients with advanced Parkinsons disease (with L-dopa), both reduction in percent awake time spent off and the ability to reduce the daily use of L-dopa were assessed as a combined endpoint and individually.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Trials in Patients with Early Parkinsons Disease (without L-dopa)</content>
                           <br/>  Trial 1 was a 12 week multicenter trial in which 63 patients with idiopathic Parkinsons disease receiving concomitant anti-Parkinson medication (but not L-dopa) were enrolled and 41 were randomized to ropinirole and 22 to placebo. Patients had a mean disease duration of approximately 2 years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented with bradykinesia and at least tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. In addition, they must have been classified as Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stage I-IV. This scale, ranging from I = unilateral involvement with minimal impairment to V = confined to wheelchair or bed, is a standard instrument used for staging patients with Parkinsons disease. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the proportion of patients experiencing a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 30% in the UPDRS motor score.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were titrated for up to 10 weeks, starting at 0.5 mg twice daily, with weekly increments of 0.5 mg twice daily to a maximum of 5 mg twice daily. Once patients reached their maximally tolerated dose (or 5 mg twice daily), they were maintained on that dose through 12 weeks. The mean dose achieved by patients at trial endpoint was 7.4 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Mean baseline UPDRS motor score was 18.6 for patients treated with ropinirole and 19.9 for patients treated with placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 6).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Trial 2 in patients with early Parkinsons disease (without L-dopa) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6 month trial. In this trial, 241 patients were enrolled and 116 were randomized to ropinirole and 125 to placebo. Patients were essentially similar to those in the trial described above; concomitant use of selegiline was allowed, but patients were not permitted to use anticholinergics or amantadine during the trial. Patients had a mean disease duration of 2 years and limited (not more than a 6 week period) or no prior exposure to L-dopa. The starting dosage of ropinirole in this trial was 0.25 mg 3 times daily. The dosage was titrated at weekly intervals by increments of 0.25 mg 3 times daily to a dosage of 1 mg 3 times daily. Further titrations at weekly intervals were at increments of 0.5 mg 3 times daily up to a dosage of 3 mg 3 times daily, and then weekly at increments of 1 mg 3times daily. Patients were to be titrated to a dosage of at least 1.5 mg 3 times daily and then to their maximally tolerated dosage, up to a maximum of 8 mg 3 times daily. The mean dose attained in patients at trial endpoint was 15.7 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary measure of effectiveness was the mean percent reduction (improvement) from baseline in the UPDRS motor score. At the end of the 6 month trial, patients treated with ropinirole showed improvement in motor score compared with placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 7).</paragraph>

                           <br/>  Trial 3 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6 month trial that randomized 149 patients (Hoehn &amp; Yahr II-IV) who were not adequately controlled on L-dopa. Ninety-five patients were randomized to ropinirole and 54 were randomized to placebo. Patients in this trial had a mean disease duration of approximately 9 years, had been exposed to L-dopa for approximately 7 years, and had experienced on-off periods with L-dopa therapy. Patients previously receiving stable doses of selegiline, amantadine, and/or anticholinergic agents could continue on these agents during the trial. Patients were started at a dosage of 0.25 mg 3 times daily of ropinirole and titrated upward by weekly intervals 
  <br/>  until an optimal therapeutic response was achieved. The maximum dosage of trial medication was 8 mg 3 times daily. All patients had to be titrated to at least a dosage of 2.5 mg 3 times daily. Patients could then be maintained on this dosage level or higher for the remainder of the trial. Once a dosage of 2.5 mg 3 times daily was achieved, patients underwent a mandatory reduction in their L-dopa dosage, to be followed by additional mandatory reductions with continued escalation of the dosage of ropinirole. Reductions in the dosage of L-dopa were also allowed if patients experienced adverse reactions that the investigator considered related to dopaminergic therapy. The mean dose attained at trial endpoint was 16.3 mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who were able both to achieve a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 20% in their L-dopa dosage and a decrease of at least 20% in the proportion of the time awake in the off condition (a period of time during the day when patients are particularly immobile), as determined by subject diary. In addition, the mean change in off time from baseline and the percent change from baseline in daily L-dopa dosage were examined.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At the end of 6 months, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 8).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Based on the protocol-mandated reductions in L-dopa dosage with escalating doses of ropinirole, patients treated with ropinirole had a 19.4% mean reduction in L-dopa dosage while patients treated with placebo had a 3% reduction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Mean daily L-dopa dosage at baseline was 759 mg for patients treated with ropinirole and 843 mg for patients treated with placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean number of daily off hours at baseline was 6.4 hours for patients treated with ropinirole and 7.3 hours for patients treated with placebo. At the end of the 6 month trial, there was a mean reduction of 1.5 hours of off time in patients treated with ropinirole and a mean reduction of 0.9 hours of off time in patients treated with placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 0.6 hours of off time.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of ropinirole in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Patients were required to have a history of a minimum of 15 RLS episodes/month during the previous month and a total score of ≥15 on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS scale) at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, anemia) were excluded. All trials employed flexible dosing, with patients initiating therapy at 0.25 mg of ropinirole once daily. Patients were titrated based on clinical response and tolerability over 7 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg once daily. All doses were taken between 1 and 3 hours before bedtime.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment, including the IRLS scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. Three of the controlled trials utilized the change from baseline in the IRLS scale at the Week 12 endpoint as the primary efficacy outcome.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Three hundred eighty patients were randomized to receive ropinirole (n = 187) or placebo (n = 193) in a U.S. trial (RLS-1); 284 were randomized to receive either ropinirole (n = 146) or placebo (n = 138) in a multinational trial (excluding U.S.) (RLS-2); and 267 patients were randomized to ropinirole (n = 131) or placebo (n = 136) in a multinational trial (including U.S.) (RLS-3). Across the 3 trials, the mean duration of RLS was 16 to 22 years (range: 0 to 65 years), mean age was approximately 54 years (range: 18 to 79 years), and approximately 61% were women. The mean dose at Week 12 was approximately 2 mg/day for the 3 trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At baseline, mean total IRLS score was 22 for ropinirole and 21.6 for placebo in RLS-1, 24.4 for ropinirole and 25.2 for placebo in RLS-2, and 23.6 for ropinirole and 24.8 for placebo in RLS-3. In all 3 trials, a statistically significant difference between the treatment group receiving ropinirole and the treatment group receiving placebo was observed at Week 12 for both the mean change from baseline in the IRLS scale total score and the percentage of patients rated as responders (much improved or very much improved) on the CGI-I (see Table 9).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term maintenance of efficacy in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in a 36 week trial. Following a 24 week, single-blind treatment phase (flexible dosages of ropinirole of 0.25 to 4 mg once daily), patients who were responders (defined as a decrease of &gt;6 points on the IRLS scale total score relative to baseline) were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or continuation of ropinirole for an additional 12 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase of at least 6 points on the IRLS scale total score to a total score of at least 15, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. For patients who were responders at Week 24, the mean dose of ropinirole was 2 mg (range: 0.25 to 4 mg). Patients continued on ropinirole demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate compared with patients randomized to placebo (32.6% versus 57.8%, P = 0.0156).</paragraph>

                     <br/>
Instruct patients to take ropinirole tablets only as prescribed. If a dose is missed, advise patients not to double their next dose. Ropinirole tablets can be taken with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ropinirole is the active ingredient in ropinirole tablets (the immediate-release formulation). Ask your patients if they are taking another medication containing ropinirole.</paragraph>

                     <br/>
Advise patients about the potential for developing a hypersensitivity/allergic reaction including manifestations such as urticaria, angioedema, rash, and pruritus when taking any ropinirole product. Inform patients who experience these or similar reactions to immediately contact their healthcare professional [see Contraindications (4)].

                     <br/>
Alert patients to the potential sedating effects caused by ropinirole tablets, including somnolence and the possibility of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. Because somnolence is a frequent adverse reaction with potentially serious consequences, patients should not drive a car, operate machinery, or engage in other potentially dangerous activities until they have gained sufficient experience with ropinirole tablets to gauge whether or not it adversely affects their mental and/or motor performance. Advise patients that if increased somnolence or episodes of falling asleep during activities of daily living (e.g., conversations, eating, driving a motor vehicle) are experienced at any time during treatment, they should not drive or participate in potentially dangerous activities until they have contacted their physician.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Advise patients of possible additive effects when patients are taking other sedating medications, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants) in combination with ropinirole tablets or when taking a concomitant medication (e.g., ciprofloxacin) that increases plasma levels of ropinirole

Advise patients that they may experience syncope and may develop hypotension with or without symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, syncope, and sometimes sweating while taking ropinirole tablets, especially if they are elderly. Hypotension and/or orthostatic symptoms may occur more frequently during initial therapy or with an increase in dose at any time (cases have been seen after weeks of treatment). Postural/orthostatic symptoms may be related to sitting up or standing. Accordingly, caution patients against standing rapidly after sitting or lying down, especially if they have been doing so for prolonged periods and especially at the initiation of treatment with ropinirole tablets

                  <paragraph>Inform patients that they may experience hallucinations (unreal visions, sounds, or sensations), and that other psychotic-like behavior can occur while taking ropinirole tablets. In patients with Parkinson’s disease, the elderly are at greater risk than younger patients. This risk is greater in patients who are taking ropinirole tablets with L-dopa or taking higher doses of ropinirole tablets and may also be further increased in patients taking any other drugs that increase dopaminergic tone. Tell patients to report hallucinations or psychotic-like behavior to their healthcare provider promptly should they develop [

Advise patients that they may experience impulse control and/or compulsive behaviors while taking ropinirole tablets. Advise patients to inform their physician or healthcare provider if they develop new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole tablets. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole tablets [

Advise patients that withdrawal symptoms may occur during or after discontinuation or dose reduction of ropinirole tablets. Advise patients who have been prescribed a lower dose or who have been withdrawn from the drug to notify their healthcare provider if they have withdrawal symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, sweating, or pain. Notify patients that in case of severe withdrawal symptoms, a trial re-administration of a dopamine agonist at the lowest effective dose may be considered [

You may suddenly fall asleep without being drowsy or without warning. This may result in having accidents. Your chances of falling asleep while doing normal activities while taking ropinirole tablets are greater if you take other medicines that cause drowsiness. Tell your healthcare provider right away if this happens. Before starting ropinirole tablets, be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you take any medicines that make you drowsy.
