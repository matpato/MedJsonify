                     <title>5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical studies, finasteride tablets reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride tablets, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride tablets may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride tablets therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride tablets for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride tablets.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Finasteride tablets may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride tablets. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA ≤3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). [<content styleCode="italics">See <linkHtml href="#Section_1.3">Indications and Usage (1.3)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#Section_6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>.</content>] Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established.    </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Finasteride tablets are contraindicated in pregnant females and not indicated for use in females. Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action, finasteride tablets may cause abnormal development of external genitalia in a male fetus if administered to a pregnant female <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, there was a dose-dependent increase in hypospadias that occurred in 3.6 to 100% of male offspring of pregnant rats administered oral finasteride during the period of major organogenesis at doses approximately 0.1 to 86 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 5 mg/day (based on AUC at animal doses of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg/day). Decreased prostatic and seminal vesicular weights, delayed preputial separation and transient nipple development were also observed in male offspring at oral maternal doses approximately 0.03 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day), along with decreased anogenital distance in male offspring at oral maternal doses approximately 0.003 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.003 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Finasteride tablet is a Type II 5α-reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the male fetus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abnormal male genital development is an expected consequence when conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is inhibited by 5α-reductase inhibitors. These outcomes are similar to those reported in male infants with genetic 5α-reductase deficiency. Females could be exposed to finasteride through contact with crushed or broken finasteride tablets or semen from a male partner taking finasteride tablets. With regard to finasteride exposure through the skin, finasteride tablets are coated and will prevent skin contact with finasteride during normal handling if the tablets have not been crushed or broken. Females who are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets because of possible exposure of a male fetus. With regard to potential finasteride exposure through semen, three studies have been conducted that measured finasteride concentrations in semen in men receiving finasteride tablets 5 mg/day. In these studies the highest amount of finasteride in semen was estimated to be 50-to 100-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 μg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men <content styleCode="italics">[see Data and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</content>

                        <paragraph>In 2 studies of healthy subjects (n=69) receiving finasteride tablets 5 mg/day for 6 to 24 weeks, finasteride concentrations in semen ranged from undetectable (&lt;0.1 ng/mL) to 10.54 ng/mL. In an earlier study using a less sensitive assay, finasteride concentrations in semen of 16 subjects receiving finasteride tablets 5 mg/day ranged from undetectable (&lt;1.0 ng/mL) to 21 ng/mL. Using the highest semen level measured and assuming 100% absorption would be up to 105 ng per day, which is 50-to 100-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 μg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</content>

                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats received finasteride during the period of major organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17). At maternal doses of oral finasteride approximately 0.1 to 86 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 5 mg/day (based on AUC at animal doses of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg/day) there was a dose-dependent increase in hypospadias that occurred in 3.6 to 100% of male offspring. Exposure multiples were estimated using data from nonpregnant rats. Days 16 to 17 of gestation is a critical period in male fetal rats for differentiation of the external genitalia. At oral maternal doses approximately 0.03 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day), male offspring had decreased prostatic and seminal vesicular weights, delayed preputial separation and transient nipple development. Decreased anogenital distance occurred in male offspring of pregnant rats that received approximately 0.003 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.003 mg/kg/day). No abnormalities were observed in female offspring at any maternal dose of finasteride.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No developmental abnormalities were observed in the offspring of untreated females mated with finasteride treated male rats that received approximately 61 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 80 mg/kg/day). Slightly decreased fertility was observed in male offspring after administration of about 3 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 3 mg/kg/day) to female rats during late gestation and lactation. No effects on fertility were seen in female offspring under these conditions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No evidence of male external genital malformations or other abnormalities were observed in rabbit fetuses exposed to finasteride during the period of major organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 18) at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg /day, (finasteride exposure levels were not measured in rabbits). However, this study may not have included the critical period for finasteride effects on development of male external genitalia in the rabbit.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The fetal effects of maternal finasteride exposure during the period of embryonic and fetal development were evaluated in the rhesus monkey (gestation days 20 to 100), in a species and development period more predictive of specific effects in humans than the studies in rats and rabbits. Intravenous administration of finasteride to pregnant monkeys at doses as high as 800 ng/day (estimated maximal blood concentration of 1.86 ng/mL or about 143 times the highest estimated exposure of pregnant females to finasteride from semen of men taking 5 mg/day) resulted in no abnormalities in male fetuses. In confirmation of the relevance of the rhesus model for human fetal development, oral administration of a dose of finasteride (2 mg/kg/day or approximately 18,000 times the highest estimated blood levels of finasteride from semen of men taking 5 mg/day) to pregnant monkeys resulted in external genital abnormalities in male fetuses. No other abnormalities were observed in male fetuses and no finasteride-related abnormalities were observed in female fetuses at any dose. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The development and enlargement of the prostate gland is dependent on the potent androgen, 5α -dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Type II 5α-reductase metabolizes testosterone to DHT in the prostate gland, liver and skin. DHT induces androgenic effects by binding to androgen receptors in the cell nuclei of these organs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase with which it slowly forms a stable enzyme complex.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Turnover from this complex is extremely slow (t<sub>½</sub> ~ 30 days). This has been demonstrated both <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>and <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor. In man, the 5α-reduced steroid metabolites in blood and urine are decreased after administration of finasteride.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In man, a single 5-mg oral dose of finasteride tablets produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, with the maximum effect observed 8 hours after the first dose. The suppression of DHT is maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval and with continued treatment. Daily dosing of finasteride tablets at 5 mg/day for up to 4 years has been shown to reduce the serum DHT concentration by approximately 70%. The median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10 to 20% but remained within the physiologic range. In a separate study in healthy men treated with finasteride 1 mg per day (n=82) or placebo (n=69), mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol were increased by approximately 15% as compared to baseline, but these remained within the physiologic range. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients receiving finasteride tablets 5 mg/day, increases of about 10% were observed in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but levels remained within the normal range. In healthy volunteers, treatment with finasteride tablets did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with BPH, finasteride tablets have no effect on circulating levels of cortisol, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No clinically meaningful effect was observed on the plasma lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides) or bone mineral density. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adult males with genetically inherited Type II 5α -reductase deficiency also have decreased levels of DHT. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to Type II 5α -reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals. These individuals have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with BPH treated with finasteride (1 to 100 mg/day) for 7 to 10 days prior to prostatectomy, an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery, compared to placebo; testosterone tissue concentration was increased up to 10 times over pretreatment levels, relative to placebo. Intraprostatic content of PSA was also decreased. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy male volunteers treated with finasteride tablets for 14 days, discontinuation of therapy resulted in a return of DHT levels to pretreatment levels in approximately 2 weeks. In patients treated for three months, prostate volume, which declined by approximately 20%, returned to close to baseline value after approximately three months of discontinuation of therapy.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a study of 15 healthy young subjects, the mean bioavailability of finasteride 5-mg tablets was 63% (range 34 to 108%), based on the ratio of area under the curve (AUC) relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose. Maximum finasteride plasma concentration averaged 37 ng/mL (range, 27 to 49 ng/mL) and was reached 1 to 2 hours postdose. Bioavailability of finasteride was not affected by food.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Distribution</content> </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Mean steady-state volume of distribution was 76 liters (range, 44 to 96 liters). Approximately 90% of circulating finasteride is bound to plasma proteins. There is a slow accumulation phase for finasteride after multiple dosing. After dosing with 5 mg/day of finasteride for 17 days, plasma concentrations of finasteride were 47 and 54% higher than after the first dose in men 45 to 60 years old (n=12) and ≥70 years old (n=12), respectively. Mean trough concentrations after 17 days of dosing were 6.2 ng/mL (range, 2.4 to 9.8 ng/mL) and 8.1 ng/mL (range, 1.8 to 19.7 ng/mL), respectively, in the two age groups. Although steady state was not reached in this study, mean trough plasma concentration in another study in patients with BPH (mean age, 65 years) receiving 5 mg/day was 9.4 ng/mL (range, 7.1 to 13.3 ng/mL; n=22) after over a year of dosing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Finasteride has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier but does not appear to distribute preferentially to the CSF.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 2 studies of healthy subjects (n=69) receiving finasteride tablets 5 mg/day for 6 to 24 weeks, finasteride concentrations in semen ranged from undetectable (&lt;0.1 ng/mL) to 10.54 ng/mL. In an earlier study using a less sensitive assay, finasteride concentrations in the semen of 16 subjects receiving finasteride tablets 5 mg/day ranged from undetectable (&lt;1.0 ng/mL) to 21 ng/mL. Thus, based on a 5-mL ejaculate volume, the amount of finasteride in semen was estimated to be 50- to 100-fold less than the dose of finasteride (5 mcg) that had no effect on circulating DHT levels in men <content styleCode="italics">[see also <linkHtml href="#Section_8.1">Use in Specific Populations (8.1)</linkHtml>  ]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Finasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme subfamily. Two metabolites, the t-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites, have been identified that possess no more than 20% of the 5α-reductase inhibitory activity of finasteride.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Excretion</content> </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy young subjects (n=15), mean plasma clearance of finasteride was 165 mL/min (range, 70 to 279 mL/min) and mean elimination half-life in plasma was 6 hours (range, 3 to 16 hours). Following an oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C-finasteride in man (n=6), a mean of 39% (range, 32 to 46%) of the dose was excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites; 57% (range, 51 to 64%) was excreted in the feces.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean terminal half-life of finasteride in subjects ≥70 years of age was approximately 8 hours (range, 6 to 15 hours; n=12), compared with 6 hours (range, 4 to 12 hours; n=12) in subjects 45 to 60 years of age. As a result, mean AUC<sub>(0-24 hr)</sub> after 17 days of dosing was 15% higher in subjects ≥70 years of age than in subjects 45 to 60 years of age (p=0.02).</paragraph>

In mice at 23 times the human exposure, estimated (25 mg/kg/day) and in rats at 39 times the human exposure (40 mg/kg/day) an increase in the incidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia was observed. A positive correlation between the proliferative changes in the Leydig cells and an increase in serum LH levels (2- to 3-fold above control) has been demonstrated in both rodent species treated with high doses of finasteride. No drug-related Leydig cell changes were seen in either rats or dogs treated with finasteride for 1 year at 30 and 350 times (20 mg/kg/day and 45 mg/kg/day, respectively) or in mice treated for 19 months at 2.3 times the human exposure, estimated (2.5 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>

In an <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>chromosome aberration assay, using Chinese hamster ovary cells, there was a slight increase in chromosome aberrations.

In an <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>chromosome aberration assay in mice, no treatment-related increase in chromosome aberration was observed with finasteride at the maximum tolerated dose of 250 mg/kg/day (228 times the human exposure) as determined in the carcinogenicity studies.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In sexually mature male rabbits treated with finasteride at 543 times the human exposure (80 mg/kg/day) for up to 12 weeks, no effect on fertility, sperm count, or ejaculate volume was seen. In sexually mature male rats treated with 61 times the human exposure (80 mg/kg/day), there were no significant effects on fertility after 6 or 12 weeks of treatment; however, when treatment was continued for up to 24 or 30 weeks, there was an apparent decrease in fertility, fecundity and an associated significant decrease in the weights of the seminal vesicles and prostate. All these effects were reversible within 6 weeks of discontinuation of treatment. No drug-related effect on testes or on mating performance has been seen in rats or rabbits. This decrease in fertility in finasteride-treated rats is secondary to its effect on accessory sex organs (prostate and seminal vesicles) resulting in failure to form a seminal plug. The seminal plug is essential for normal fertility in rats and is not relevant in man.     </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Finasteride tablets 5 mg/day was initially evaluated in patients with symptoms of BPH and enlarged prostates by digital rectal examination in two 1-year, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies and their 5-year open extensions.<br/>
                           <br/>Finasteride tablets was further evaluated in the finasteride tablets A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-year, multicenter study. 3,040 patients between the ages of 45 and 78, with moderate to severe symptoms of BPH and an enlarged prostate upon digital rectal examination, were randomized into the study (1,524 to finasteride, 1,516 to placebo) and 3,016 patients were evaluable for efficacy. 1,883 patients completed the 4-year study (1,000 in the finasteride group, 883 in the placebo group).</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Symptoms were quantified using a score similar to the American Urological Association Symptom Score, which evaluated both obstructive symptoms (impairment of size and force of stream, sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, delayed or interrupted urination) and irritative symptoms (nocturia, daytime frequency, need to strain or push the flow of urine) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for six symptoms and a 0 to 4 scale for one symptom, for a total possible score of 34.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients in A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study had moderate to severe symptoms at baseline (mean of approximately 15 points on a 0 to 34 point scale). Patients randomized to finasteride tablets who remained on therapy for 4 years had a mean (± 1 SD) decrease in symptom score of 3.3 (± 5.8) points compared with 1.3 (± 5.6) points in the placebo group. (See Figure 1.) A statistically significant improvement in symptom score was evident at 1 year in patients treated with finasteride tablets vs placebo (-2.3 vs -1.6), and this improvement continued through Year 4.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study. Although an early improvement in urinary symptoms was seen in some patients, a therapeutic trial of at least 6 months was generally necessary to assess whether a beneficial response in symptom relief had been achieved. The improvement in BPH symptoms was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional 5 years of open extension studies.<br/>

                           <br/>In A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study, efficacy was also assessed by evaluating treatment failures. Treatment failure was prospectively defined as BPH-related urological events or clinical deterioration, lack of improvement and/or the need for alternative therapy. BPH-related urological events were defined as urological surgical intervention and acute urinary retention requiring catheterization. Complete event information was available for 92% of the patients. The following table (Table 5) summarizes the results.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the patients in A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study who remained on therapy for the duration of the study and had evaluable urinary flow data, finasteride tablets increased maximum urinary flow rate by 1.9 mL/sec compared with 0.2 mL/sec in the placebo group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There was a clear difference between treatment groups in maximum urinary flow rate in favor of finasteride tablets by month 4 (1.0 vs 0.3 mL/sec) which was maintained throughout the study. In the earlier 1-year studies, increase in maximum urinary flow rate was comparable to A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study and was maintained through the first year and throughout an additional 5 years of open extension studies.</paragraph>

                           <br/>In A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study, prostate volume was assessed yearly by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a subset of patients. In patients treated with finasteride tablets who remained on therapy, prostate volume was reduced compared with both baseline and placebo throughout the 4-year study. Finasteride tablets decreased prostate volume by 17.9% (from 55.9 cc at baseline to 45.8 cc at 4 years) compared with an increase of 14.1% (from 51.3 cc to 58.5 cc) in the placebo group (p&lt;0.001). (See Figure 4.)</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Results seen in earlier studies were comparable to those seen in A Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study. Mean prostate volume at baseline ranged between 40 to 50 cc. The reduction in prostate volume was seen during the first year and maintained throughout an additional five years of open extension studies.<br/>

                        <paragraph>The Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 4- to 6-year study (average 5 years) in 3,047 men with symptomatic BPH, who were randomized to receive finasteride tablets 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride tablets 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All participants underwent weekly titration of doxazosin (or its placebo) from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg/day. Only those who tolerated the 4 or 8 mg dose level were kept on doxazosin (or its placebo) in the study. The participant's final tolerated dose (either 4 mg or 8 mg) was administered beginning at end-Week 4. The final doxazosin dose was administered once per day, at bedtime.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean patient age at randomization was 62.6 years (±7.3 years). Patients were Caucasian (82%), African American (9%), Hispanic (7%), Asian (1%) or Native American (&lt;1%). The mean duration of BPH symptoms was 4.7 years (±4.6 years). Patients had moderate to severe BPH symptoms at baseline with a mean AUA symptom score of approximately 17 out of 35 points. Mean maximum urinary flow rate was 10.5 mL/sec (±2.6 mL/sec). The mean prostate volume as measured by transrectal ultrasound was 36.3 mL (±20.1 mL).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Prostate volume was ≤20 mL in 16% of patients, ≥50 mL in 18% of patients and between 21 and 49 mL in 66% of patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was a composite measure of the first occurrence of any of the following five outcomes: a ≥4 point confirmed increase from baseline in symptom score, acute urinary retention, BPH-related renal insufficiency (creatinine rise), recurrent urinary tract infections or urosepsis, or incontinence. Compared to placebo, treatment with finasteride tablets, doxazosin, or combination therapy resulted in a reduction in the risk of experiencing one of these five outcome events by 34% (p=0.002), 39% (p&lt;0.001), and 67% (p&lt;0.001), respectively. Combination therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint compared to treatment with finasteride tablets alone (49%; p≤0.001) or doxazosin alone (46%; p≤0.001). (See Table 6.)</paragraph>

The risk of symptom score progression was reduced by 30% (p=0.016), 46% (p&lt;0.001), and 64% (p&lt;0.001) in patients treated with finasteride tablets, doxazosin, or the combination, respectively, compared to patients treated with placebo (see Figure 5).

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland. The prostate is located below the bladder. As the prostate enlarges, it may slowly restrict the flow of urine. This can lead to symptoms such as:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• a weak or interrupted urinary stream</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• a feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• a feeling of delay or hesitation when you start to urinate</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• a need to urinate often, especially at night</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• a feeling that you must urinate right away.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In some men, BPH can lead to serious problems, including urinary tract infections, a sudden inability to pass urine (acute urinary retention), as well as the need for surgery.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">What finasteride tablets does:</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Finasteride tablets lowers levels of a hormone called DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which is a cause of prostate growth. Lowering DHT leads to shrinkage of the enlarged prostate gland in most men. This can lead to gradual improvement in urine flow and symptoms over the next several months. Finasteride tablets will help reduce the risk of the need for surgery related to an enlarged prostate. However, since each case of BPH is different, you should know that:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• Even though the prostate shrinks, you may NOT notice an improvement in urine flow</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>or symptoms.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• You may need to take finasteride tablets for six (6) months or more to see whether it improves your symptoms.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>• Therapy with finasteride tablets may reduce your risk for the need for surgery for an enlarged prostate.</paragraph>
