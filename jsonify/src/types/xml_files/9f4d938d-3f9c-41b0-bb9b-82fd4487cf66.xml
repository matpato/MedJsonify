                     <title>5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>].</content>

                        <paragraph>Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10-14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke.

                        <paragraph>Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid the use of Diclofenac Potassium in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If Diclofenac Potassium is used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.</paragraph>

Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.3 Hepatotoxicity</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of AST (SGOT) were observed in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a large open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2-6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of the 3,700 patients and included marked elevations (greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3-8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of NSAID therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female sex, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more then 90 days.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with Diclofenac Potassium, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), Diclofenac Potassium should be discontinued immediately.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue Diclofenac Potassium immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver-related event in patients treated with Diclofenac Potassium, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing Diclofenac Potassium with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen, antibiotics, antiepileptics).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as Diclofenac Potassium. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia <content styleCode="xmChange">is </content>often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinueÂ Diclofenac Potassium and evaluate the patient immediately.</paragraph>

In patients treated with Diclofenac Potassium 25 mg (N=345) or a higher dose, three or four times a day, for 4 to 5 days, the most common adverse reactions (i.e., reported in â¥ 1% of Diclofenac Potassiumtreated patients) were as follows: gastrointestinal experiences including abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, somnolence, pruritus, and increased sweating. (see Table 1).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of Diclofenac Potassiumwas evaluated in 125 pediatric patients, 12 years to 17 years of age. Forty-nine (49) patients with mild to moderate acute pain from a surgical procedure or an acute painful condition were treated with Diclofenac Potassium 25 mg up to four times a day, for 4 days. Seventy-six (76) pediatric patients who underwent insertion of either orthodontic separators or arch wires were treated with a single-dose of either Diclofenac Potassium 25 mg or Diclofenac Potassium 50 mg after completion of the procedure. The most common adverse reactions in the multiple-dose studies were nausea (14.3%), headache (10.2%), constipation (8.2%), abdominal pain (4.1%), vomiting<br/>(4.1%), dizziness (4.1%), back pain (4.1%), and musculoskeletal pain (4.1%).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of malformations was observed in mice, rats, and rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 1, 1, and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of Diclofenac Potassium, despite the presence of maternal and fetal toxicity at these doses. In published studies, administration of clinically relevant doses of diclofenac to pregnant rats produced adverse effects on brain, kidney, and testicular development <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. Prostaglandins also have been shown to have an important role in fetal kidney development. In published animal studies, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors have been reported to impair kidney development when administered at clinically relevant doses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Published studies and postmarketing reports describe maternal NSAID use at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy associated with fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios, and in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. In many cases, but not all, the decrease in amniotic fluid was transient and reversible with cessation of the drug. There have been a limited number of case reports of maternal NSAID use and neonatal renal dysfunction without oligohydramnios, some of which were irreversible. Some cases of neonatal renal dysfunction required treatment with invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion or dialysis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Methodological limitations of these postmarketing studies and reports include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of drug exposure; and concomitant use of other medications. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal NSAID use. Because the published safety data on neonatal outcomes involved mostly preterm infants, the generalizability of certain reported risks to the full-term infant exposed to NSAIDs through maternal use is uncertain.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Reproductive and developmental studies in animals demonstrated that diclofenac sodium administration during organogenesis did not produce malformations despite the induction of maternal toxicity and fetal toxicity in mice at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of Diclofenac Potassium, 100 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA) comparison), and in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 1 and 2 times, respectively, the MRHD based on BSA comparison).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study in which pregnant rats were orally administered 2 or 4 mg/kg diclofenac (0.2 and 0.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) from Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21, significant maternal toxicity (peritonitis, mortality) was noted. These maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice and rats.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In published studies, diclofenac administration to pregnant rats prolonged gestation and produced liver toxicity and neuronal loss in offspring (1 mg/kg, IP; 0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison), impaired nephrogenesis in the kidney (3.6 mg/kg, IP; 0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison), and caused adverse effects on the developing testes (6.1 mg/kg, PO; 0.6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison).</paragraph>

Use of Diclofenac Potassium in this age group is based on extrapolation of efficacy from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and supported by pharmacokinetic and safety data from two open-label studies in 49 patients 12 years to 17 years of age with mild to moderate acute pain and one active-controlled study in 76 pediatric patients 12 years to 16 years of age with orthodontic discomfort. Based on the available data, the plasma diclofenac concentration in adolescent patients was comparable to that observed in healthy adults. The safety profile of Diclofenac Potassium in adolescent patients was similar to adults.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of Diclofenac Potassium in patients less than 12 years of age have not been established.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosages have been typically limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have been generally reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred.

Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of ingestion or in patients with a large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action of Diclofenac Potassium, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis <content styleCode="italics">in vitro.</content> Diclofenac concentrations reached during therapy have produced <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because diclofenac is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Diclofenac is more than 99% bound to human serum proteins, primarily to albumin. Serum protein binding is constant over the concentration range (0.15-105 mcg/mL) achieved with recommended doses.<br/>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Five diclofenac metabolites have been identified in human plasma and urine. The metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, 4',5-dihydroxy- and 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy diclofenac. The major diclofenac metabolite, 4'-hydroxy-diclofenac, has very weak pharmacologic activity. The formation of 4'-hydroxy diclofenac is primarily mediated by CPY2C9. Both diclofenac and its oxidative metabolites undergo glucuronidation or sulfation followed by biliary excretion. Acylglucuronidation mediated by UGT2B7 and oxidation mediated by CPY2C8 may also play a role in diclofenac metabolism. CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of minor metabolites, 5-hydroxy and 3'-hydroxy- diclofenac. In patients with renal dysfunction, peak concentrations of metabolites 4'-hydroxy-and 5-hydroxy-diclofenac were approximately 50% and 4% of the parent compound after single oral dosing compared to 27% and 1% in normal healthy subjects.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Diclofenac is eliminated through metabolism and subsequent urinary and biliary excretion of the glucuronide and the sulfate conjugates of the metabolites. Little or no free unchanged diclofenac is excreted in the urine. Approximately 65% of the dose is excreted in the urine, and approximately 35% in the bile as conjugates of unchanged diclofenac plus metabolites. Because renal elimination is not a significant pathway of elimination for unchanged diclofenac, dosing adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction is not necessary. The terminal half-life of unchanged diclofenac is approximately 1 hour.</paragraph>

A 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in mice employing diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.014 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in males and 1 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.04 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison) in females did not reveal any oncogenic potential.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The efficacy ofÂ Diclofenac Potassium in adults was demonstrated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel arm, multiple-dose clinical trials comparingÂ Diclofenac Potassium 25 mg and placebo in patients with pain following bunionectomy with osteotomy. Once patients met the criteria for randomization (pain intensity â¥4 on a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale) they received their initial dose of study medication followed by a remedication dose when requested by the patient, and were then dosed every six hours over four days. Pain intensity was recorded at 3 and 6 hours postdose during the fixed dosing period. In Study 1, mean baseline pain intensity scores were 6.9 in theÂ Diclofenac Potassium group (range: 4-10) and 7.3 in the placebo group (range: 4-10). In both studies, patients treated withÂ Diclofenac Potassium had a lower mean pain intensity score over the 48-hour inpatient period following the first remedication dose (see Figure 1). The median time to onset of pain relief was less than one hour forÂ Diclofenac Potassium 25 mg across the clinical trials. The results were similar in Study 2.</paragraph>
