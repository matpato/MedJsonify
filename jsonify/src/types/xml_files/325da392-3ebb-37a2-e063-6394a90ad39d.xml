                        <paragraph>DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP-TITRATION. Prior to initiation of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules is 10 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Patients who tolerate a dose of 10 mg once daily may have their dose increased to 20, 40, and 80 mg over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. Thus, during these periods, they should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>The dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP-TITRATION. Treatment with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules be started at 20 mg once daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 40 mg once daily, then again to the target dose of 80 mg once daily. A lower starting dose may be used (10 mg once daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral beta-blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules is 20 mg once daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about one hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 40 mg once daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure one hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 80 mg once daily if tolerated and needed. Although not specifically studied, it is anticipated the full antihypertensive effect of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules would be seen within 7 to 14 days as had been demonstrated with immediate-release carvedilol. Total daily dose should not exceed 80 mg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>In clinical trials of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules in subjects with hypertension (338 subjects) and in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following a myocardial infarction or heart failure (187 subjects), the profile of adverse events observed with carvedilol phosphate was generally similar to that observed with the administration of immediate-release carvedilol. Therefore, the information included within this section is based on data from controlled clinical trials with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules as well as immediate-release carvedilol tablets.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with angina following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other beta-blockers, when discontinuation of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules is planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should be discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks whenever possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue therapy with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension or heart failure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In clinical trials with immediate-release carvedilol, bradycardia was reported in about 2% of hypertensive subjects, 9% of subjects with heart failure, and 6.5% of subjects with myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction. Bradycardia was reported in 0.5% of subjects receiving carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules in a trial of subjects with heart failure and subjects with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction. There were no reports of bradycardia in the clinical trial of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules in hypertension. However, if pulse rate drops below 55 beats/minute, the dosage of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should be reduced.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of primarily mild-to-moderate heart failure with immediate-release carvedilol, hypotension and postural hypotension occurred in 9.7% and syncope in 3.4% of subjects receiving carvedilol compared with 3.6% and 2.5% of placebo subjects, respectively. The risk for these events was highest during the first 30 days of dosing, corresponding to the up-titration period and was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 0.7% of carvedilol subjects, compared with 0.4% of placebo subjects. In a long-term, placebo-controlled trial in severe heart failure (COPERNICUS), hypotension and postural hypotension occurred in 15.1% and syncope in 2.9% of subjects with heart failure receiving carvedilol compared with 8.7% and 2.3% of placebo subjects, respectively. These events were a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 1.1% of carvedilol subjects, compared with 0.8% of placebo subjects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>In a trial comparing subjects with heart failure switched to carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules or maintained on immediate-release carvedilol tablets, there was a 2-fold increase in the combined incidence of hypotension, syncope, or dizziness in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) switched from the highest dose of immediate-release carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) to carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules 80 mg once daily

Syncope was reported in 3.9% and 1.9% of subjects, respectively. These events were a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 2.5% of subjects receiving carvedilol, compared with 0.2% of placebo subjects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Starting with a low dose, administration with food, and gradual up-titration should decrease the likelihood of syncope or excessive hypotension

                        <paragraph>Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased, and the dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes

  </content>. Occasionally it is necessary to lower the dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules. In a placebo-controlled trial of subjects with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with immediate-release carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in subjects treated with carvedilol than with placebo. Worsening heart failure observed during long-term therapy is more likely to be related to the patients’ underlying disease than to treatment with carvedilol.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients with bronchospastic disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive agents. It is prudent, if carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous beta-agonists is minimized.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of subjects with heart failure, subjects with bronchospastic disease were enrolled if they did not require oral or inhaled medication to treat their bronchospastic disease. In such patients, it is recommended that carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules be used with caution. The dosing recommendations should be followed closely and the dose should be lowered if any evidence of bronchospasm is observed during up-titration.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Betablockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Rarely, use of carvedilol in patients with heart failure has resulted in deterioration of renal function. Patients at risk appear to be those with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg), ischemic heart disease and diffuse vascular disease, and/or underlying renal insufficiency. Renal function has returned to baseline when carvedilol was stopped. In patients with these risk factors it is recommended that renal function be monitored during up-titration of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules and the drug discontinued or dosage reduced if worsening of renal function occurs.</paragraph>

This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to the surgical technique, such as utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. There does not appear to be a benefit of stopping alpha-1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in subjects with heart failure (mild, moderate, and severe), in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction, and in hypertensive subjects. The observed adverse event profile was consistent with the pharmacology of the drug and the health status of the subjects in the clinical trials. Adverse events reported for each of these populations reflecting the use of either carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules or immediate-release carvedilol tablets are provided below. Excluded are adverse events considered too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population. Rates of adverse events were generally similar across demographic subsets (men and women, elderly and non-elderly, blacks and non-blacks). Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules has been evaluated for safety in a 4-week (2 weeks of immediate­ release carvedilol tablets and 2 weeks of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules) clinical trial (n = 187) which included 157 subjects with stable mild, moderate, or severe chronic heart failure and 30 subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following acute myocardial infarction. The profile of adverse events observed with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules in this small, short-term trial was generally similar to that observed with immediate-release carvedilol tablets. Differences in safety would not be expected based on the similarity in plasma levels for carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules and immediate-release carvedilol.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The following information describes the safety experience in heart failure with immediate-release carvedilol.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in heart failure in more than 4,500 subjects worldwide of whom more than 2,100 participated in placebo-controlled clinical trials. Approximately 60% of the total treated population in placebo-controlled clinical trials received carvedilol for at least 6 months and 30% received carvedilol for at least 12 months. In the COMET trial, 1,511 subjects with mild-to-moderate heart failure were treated with carvedilol for up to 5.9 years (mean 4.8 years). Both in U.S. clinical trials in mild-to-moderate heart failure that compared carvedilol in daily doses up to 100 mg (n = 765) with placebo (n = 437), and in a multinational clinical trial in severe heart failure (COPERNICUS) that compared carvedilol in daily doses up to 50 mg (n = 1,156) with placebo (n = 1,133), discontinuation rates for adverse experiences were similar in carvedilol and placebo subjects. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the only cause of discontinuation greater than 1% and occurring more often on carvedilol was dizziness (1.3% on carvedilol, 0.6% on placebo in the COPERNICUS trial).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Table 2 shows adverse events reported in subjects with mild-to-moderate heart failure enrolled in U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials, and with severe heart failure enrolled in the COPERNICUS trial. Shown are adverse events that occurred more frequently in drug-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects with an incidence of greater than 3% in subjects treated with carvedilol regardless of causality. Median trial medication exposure was 6.3 months for both carvedilol and placebo subjects in the trials of mild-to-moderate heart failure and 10.4 months in the trial of subjects with severe heart failure. The adverse event profile of carvedilol observed in the long-term COMET trial was generally similar to that observed in the U.S. Heart Failure Trials.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in survivors of an acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction in the CAPRICORN trial which involved 969 subjects who received carvedilol and 980 who received placebo. Approximately 75% of the subjects received carvedilol for at least 6 months and 53% received carvedilol for at least 12 months. Subjects were treated for an average of 12.9 months and 12.8 months with carvedilol and placebo, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse events reported with carvedilol in the CAPRICORN trial were consistent with the profile of the drug in the U.S. heart failure trials and the COPERNICUS trial. The only additional adverse events reported in CAPRICORN in &gt;3% of the subjects and more commonly on carvedilol were dyspnea, anemia, and lung edema. The following adverse events were reported with a frequency of &gt;1% but ≤3% and more frequently with carvedilol: flu syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disorder, hypotonia, depression, gastrointestinal pain, arthritis, and gout. The overall rates of discontinuations due to adverse events were similar in both groups of subjects. In this database, the only cause of discontinuation &gt;1% and occurring more often on carvedilol was hypotension (1.5% on carvedilol, 0.2% on placebo).</paragraph>

The overall rates of discontinuations due to adverse events were similar between carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules and placebo.

                              <paragraph>The following information describes the safety experience in hypertension with immediate-release carvedilol.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in hypertension in more than 2,193 subjects in U.S. clinical trials and in 2,976 subjects in international clinical trials. Approximately 36% of the total treated population received carvedilol for at least 6 months. In general, carvedilol was well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg daily. Most adverse events reported during carvedilol therapy were of mild to moderate severity. In U.S. controlled clinical trials directly comparing carvedilol monotherapy in doses up to 50 mg (n = 1,142) with placebo (n = 462), 4.9% of carvedilol subjects discontinued for adverse events versus 5.2% of placebo subjects. Although there was no overall difference in discontinuation rates, discontinuations were more common in the carvedilol group for postural hypotension (1% versus 0). The overall incidence of adverse events in U.S. placebo-controlled trials was found to increase with increasing dose of carvedilol. For individual adverse events this could only be distinguished for dizziness, which increased in frequency from 2% to 5% as total daily dose increased from 6.25 mg to 50 mg as single or divided doses.</paragraph>

Rates of transaminase elevations (2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal) observed during controlled clinical trials have generally been similar between subjects treated with carvedilol and those treated with placebo. However, transaminase elevations, confirmed by rechallenge, have been observed with carvedilol. In a long-term, placebo-controlled trial in severe heart failure, subjects treated with carvedilol had lower values for hepatic transaminases than subjects treated with placebo, possibly because carvedilol-induced improvements in cardiac function led to less hepatic congestion and/or improved hepatic blood flow.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Interactions of carvedilol with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 isoenzyme (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of carvedilol

   <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]
 
  </content>. Retrospective analysis of side effects in clinical trials showed that poor 2D6 metabolizers had a higher rate of dizziness during up-titration, presumably resulting from vasodilating effects of the higher concentrations of the alpha-blocking R(+) enantiomer.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Modest increases in mean trough cyclosporine concentrations were observed following initiation of carvedilol treatment in 21 renal transplant subjects suffering from chronic vascular rejection. In about 30% of subjects, the dose of cyclosporine had to be reduced in order to maintain cyclosporine concentrations within the therapeutic range, while in the remainder no adjustment was needed. On the average for the group, the dose of cyclosporine was reduced about 20% in these subjects. Due to wide interindividual variability in the dose adjustment required, it is recommended that cyclosporine concentrations be monitored closely after initiation of carvedilol therapy and that the dose of cyclosporine be adjusted as appropriate.</paragraph>

The concomitant administration of amiodarone or other CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules may enhance the beta-blocking activity, resulting in further slowing of the heart rate or cardiac conduction. Patients should be observed for signs of bradycardia or heart block, particularly when one agent is added to pre-existing treatment with the other.

                        <paragraph>Available data regarding use of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there are drug-associated risks of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy. The use of beta-blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression in the neonate (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at clinically relevant doses (see Data). Oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and an increased frequency of delayed fetal skeletal development at maternally toxic doses that were 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In addition, oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased post-implantation loss at doses 25 times the MRHD (see

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

  <sup>2</sup>) accompanied by an increased incidence of fetuses with delayed skeletal development. In rats, the no-effect level for embryo-fetal toxicity was 60 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD as mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>); in rabbits, it was 15 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD as mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>). In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats administered carvedilol from late gestation through lactation, increased embryo-lethality was observed at a maternally toxic dose of 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 32 times the MRHD as mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>), and pup mortality and delays in physical growth/development were observed at 60 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD as mg/m

                  <paragraph>Overdosage may cause severe hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Respiratory problems, bronchospasms, vomiting, lapses of consciousness, and generalized seizures may also occur.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The patient should be placed in a supine position and, where necessary, kept under observation and treated under intensive-care conditions. The following agents may be administered:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="italics">For excessive bradycardia:</content>Atropine, 2 mg IV.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="italics">To support cardiovascular function:</content>Glucagon, 5 to 10 mg IV rapidly over 30 seconds, followed by a continuous infusion of 5 mg/hour; sympathomimetics (dobutamine, isoprenaline, adrenaline) at doses according to body weight and effect.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If peripheral vasodilation dominates, it may be necessary to administer adrenaline or noradrenaline with continuous monitoring of circulatory conditions. For therapy-resistant bradycardia, pacemaker therapy should be performed. For bronchospasm, beta-sympathomimetics (as aerosol or IV) or aminophylline IV should be given. In the event of seizures, slow IV injection of diazepam or clonazepam is recommended.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>NOTE: In the event of severe intoxication where there are symptoms of shock, treatment with antidotes must be continued for a sufficiently long period of time consistent with the 7- to 10-hour half-life of carvedilol.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no experience of overdosage with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules. Cases of overdosage with carvedilol alone or in combination with other drugs have been reported. Quantities ingested in some cases exceeded 1,000 milligrams. Symptoms experienced included low blood pressure and heart rate. Standard supportive treatment was provided and individuals recovered.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The basis for the beneficial effects of carvedilol in patients with heart failure and in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following an acute myocardial infarction is not known. The concentration-response relationship for beta

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity has been demonstrated in animal and human studies showing that carvedilol (1) reduces cardiac output in normal subjects, (2) reduces exercise- and/or isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (3) reduces reflex orthostatic tachycardia. Significant beta-adrenoreceptor blocking effect is usually seen within 1 hour of drug administration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Alpha
 
  <sub>1</sub>-adrenoreceptor blocking activity has been demonstrated in human and animal studies, showing that carvedilol (1) attenuates the pressor effects of phenylephrine, (2) causes vasodilation, and (3) reduces peripheral vascular resistance. These effects contribute to the reduction of blood pressure and usually are seen within 30 minutes of drug administration.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Due to the alpha
 
  <sub>1</sub>-receptor blocking activity of carvedilol, blood pressure is lowered more in the standing than in the supine position, and symptoms of postural hypotension (1.8%), including rare instances of syncope, can occur. Following oral administration, when postural hypotension has occurred, it has been transient and is uncommon when immediate-release carvedilol is administered with food at the recommended starting dose and titration increments are closely followed

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the beta
 
  <sub>1</sub>-blocking effect of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules, as measured by heart rate response to submaximal bicycle ergometry, was shown to be equivalent to that observed with immediate-release carvedilol at steady state in adult subjects with essential hypertension.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In hypertensive subjects with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of carvedilol decreased renal vascular resistance with no change in glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow. Changes in excretion of sodium, potassium, uric acid, and phosphorus in hypertensive patients with normal renal function were similar after carvedilol and placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carvedilol has little effect on plasma catecholamines, plasma aldosterone, or electrolyte levels, but it does significantly reduce plasma renin activity when given for at least 4 weeks. It also increases levels of atrial natriuretic peptide.</paragraph>

The absorption of carvedilol from carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules is slower and more prolonged compared with the immediate-release carvedilol tablet with peak concentrations achieved approximately 5 hours after administration. Plasma concentrations of carvedilol increase in a dose-proportional manner over the dosage range of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules 10 to 80 mg. Within-subject and between-subject variability for AUC and C

  <sub>max</sub>(43%) were observed when carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules were administered in the fasted state compared with administration after a standard meal. Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should be taken with food.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a trial with adult subjects, sprinkling the contents of the carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsule on applesauce did not appear to have a significant effect on overall exposure (AUC) compared with administration of the intact capsule following a standard meal, but did result in a decrease in C

                           <content styleCode="underline">Distribution:</content>Carvedilol is more than 98% bound to plasma proteins, primarily with albumin. The plasma-protein binding is independent of concentration over the therapeutic range. Carvedilol is a basic, lipophilic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 115 L, indicating substantial distribution into extravascular tissues.

                           <content styleCode="underline">Metabolism and Excretion:</content>Carvedilol is extensively metabolized. Following oral administration of radiolabelled carvedilol to healthy volunteers, carvedilol accounted for only about 7% of the total radioactivity in plasma as measured by AUC. Less than 2% of the dose was excreted unchanged in the urine. Carvedilol is metabolized primarily by aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation. The oxidative metabolites are further metabolized by conjugation via glucuronidation and sulfation. The metabolites of carvedilol are excreted primarily via the bile into the feces. Demethylation and hydroxylation at the phenol ring produce 3 active metabolites with beta-receptor blocking activity. Based on preclinical studies, the 4'-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is approximately 13 times more potent than carvedilol for beta-blockade.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Compared with carvedilol, the 3 active metabolites exhibit weak vasodilating activity. Plasma concentrations of the active metabolites are about one-tenth of those observed for carvedilol and have pharmacokinetics similar to the parent. Carvedilol undergoes stereoselective first-pass metabolism with plasma levels of R(+)-carvedilol approximately 2 to 3 times higher than S(–)-carvedilol following oral administration of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules in healthy subjects. Apparent clearance is 90 L/h and 213 L/h for R(+)- and S(–)-carvedilol, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of both R(+) and S(–)-carvedilol in human liver microsomes were CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, 2C19, 1A2, and 2E1. CYP2D6 is thought to be the major enzyme in the 4'- and 5'-hydroxylation of carvedilol, with a potential contribution from 3A4. CYP2C9 is thought to be of primary importance in the O-methylation pathway of S(–)-carvedilol.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carvedilol is subject to the effects of genetic polymorphism with poor metabolizers of debrisoquin (a marker for cytochrome P450 2D6) exhibiting 2- to 3-fold higher plasma concentrations of R(+)-carvedilol compared with extensive metabolizers. In contrast, plasma levels of S(–)-carvedilol are increased only about 20% to 25% in poor metabolizers, indicating this enantiomer is metabolized to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 2D6 than R(+)-carvedilol. The pharmacokinetics of carvedilol do not appear to be different in poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin (patients deficient in cytochrome P450 2C19).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In 2-year studies conducted in rats given carvedilol at doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD as mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>) or in mice given up to 200 mg/kg/day (16 times the MRHD as mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>), carvedilol had no carcinogenic effect.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carvedilol was negative when tested in a battery of genotoxicity assays, including the Ames and the CHO/HGPRT assays for mutagenicity and the in vitro hamster micronucleus and in vivo human lymphocyte cell tests for clastogenicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a combined fertility/developmental/post-natal toxicity study, rats were given carvedilol (12, 60, 300 mg/kg/day) orally by gavage for 2 weeks before mating and through mating, gestation, and weaning for females and for 62 days prior to and through mating for males. At a dosage of 300 mg/kg/day (≥ 50 times the MRHD as mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>) carvedilol was toxic to adult rats (sedation, reduced weight gain) and was associated with a reduced number of successful matings, prolonged mating time, fewer corpora lutea and implants per dam, fewer live pups per litter, and delays in physical growth/development. The no-effect level for overt toxicity and impairment of fertility was 60 mg/kg/day (10 times the MRHD as mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>).

                        <paragraph>A total of 6,975 subjects with mild-to-severe heart failure were evaluated in placebo-controlled and active-controlled trials of immediate-release carvedilol.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carvedilol was studied in 5 multicenter, placebo-controlled trials, and in 1 active-controlled trial (COMET trial) involving subjects with mild-to-moderate heart failure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Four U.S. multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolled 1,094 subjects (696 randomized to carvedilol) with NYHA class II-III heart failure and ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.35. The vast majority were on digitalis, diuretics, and an ACE inhibitor at trial entry. Subjects were assigned to the trials based upon exercise ability. An Australia-New Zealand double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 415 subjects (half randomized to immediate-release carvedilol) with less severe heart failure. All protocols excluded subjects expected to undergo cardiac transplantation during the 7.5 to 15 months of double-blind follow-up. All randomized subjects had tolerated a 2-week course on immediate-release carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>In each trial, there was a primary end point, either progression of heart failure (1 U.S. trial) or exercise tolerance (2 U.S. trials meeting enrollment goals and the Australia-New Zealand trial). There were many secondary end points specified in these trials, including NYHA classification, patient and physician global assessments, and cardiovascular hospitalization. Other analyses not prospectively planned included the sum of deaths and total cardiovascular hospitalizations. In situations where the primary end points of a trial do not show a significant benefit of treatment, assignment of significance values to the other results is complex, and such values need to be interpreted cautiously.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>The results of the U.S. and Australia-New Zealand trials were as follows:</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this double-blind trial, 3,029 subjects with NYHA class II-IV heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%) were randomized to receive either carvedilol (target dose: 25 mg twice daily) or immediate-release metoprolol tartrate (target dose: 50 mg twice daily). The mean age of the subjects was approximately 62 years, 80% were males, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline was 26%. Approximately 96% of the subjects had NYHA class II or III heart failure. Concomitant treatment included diuretics (99%), ACE inhibitors (91%), digitalis (59%), aldosterone antagonists (11%), and “statin” lipid-lowering agents (21%). The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 years. The mean dose of carvedilol was 42 mg per day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The trial had 2 primary end points: all-cause mortality and the composite of death plus hospitalization for any reason. The results of COMET are presented in Table 5 below. All-cause mortality carried most of the statistical weight and was the primary determinant of the trial size. All-cause mortality was 34% in the subjects treated with carvedilol and was 40% in the immediate-release metoprolol group ( 
  <content styleCode="italics">P</content>= 0.0017; hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.93). The effect on mortality was primarily due to a reduction in cardiovascular death. The difference between the 2 groups with respect to the composite end point was not significant ( 
  <content styleCode="italics">P</content>= 0.122). The estimated mean survival was 8.0 years with carvedilol and 6.6 years with immediate-release metoprolol.

                        <paragraph>In a double-blind trial, 2,289 subjects with heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% (mean 20%), despite digitalis (66%), diuretics (99%), and ACE inhibitors (89%), were randomized to placebo or carvedilol. Carvedilol was titrated from a starting dose of 3.125 mg twice daily to the maximum tolerated dose or up to 25 mg twice daily over a minimum of 6 weeks. Most subjects achieved the target dose of 25 mg. The trial was conducted in Eastern and Western Europe, the United States, Israel, and Canada. Similar numbers of subjects per group (about 100) withdrew during the titration period.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>The primary end point of the trial was all-cause mortality, but cause-specific mortality and the risk of death or hospitalization (total, cardiovascular [CV], or heart failure [HF]) were also examined. The developing trial data were followed by a data monitoring committee, and mortality analyses were adjusted for these multiple looks. The trial was stopped after a median follow-up of 10 months because of an observed 35% reduction in mortality (from 19.7% per patient-year on placebo to 12.8% on carvedilol: hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52 to 0.81,

                     <title>14.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>CAPRICORN was a double-blind trial comparing carvedilol and placebo in 1,959 subjects with a recent myocardial infarction (within 21 days) and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40%, with (47%) or without symptoms of heart failure. Subjects given carvedilol received 6.25 mg twice daily, titrated as tolerated to 25 mg twice daily. Subjects had to have a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, a sitting heart rate greater than 60 beats per minute, and no contraindication to beta-blocker use. Treatment of the index infarction included aspirin (85%), IV or oral beta-blockers (37%), nitrates (73%), heparin (64%), thrombolytics (40%), and acute angioplasty (12%). Background treatment included ACE inhibitors or angiotensin ­receptor blockers (97%), anticoagulants (20%), lipid-lowering agents (23%), and diuretics (34%). Baseline population characteristics included an average age of 63 years, 74% male, 95% Caucasian, mean blood pressure 121/74 mm Hg, 22% with diabetes, and 54% with a history of hypertension. Mean dosage achieved of carvedilol was 20 mg twice daily; mean duration of follow-up was 15 months.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>All-cause mortality was 15% in the placebo group and 12% in the carvedilol group, indicating a 23% risk reduction in subjects treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 2% to 40%, 
  <content styleCode="italics">P</content>= 0.03), as shown in Figure 3. The effects on mortality in various subgroups are shown in Figure 4. Nearly all deaths were cardiovascular (which were reduced by 25% by carvedilol), and most of these deaths were sudden or related to pump failure (both types of death were reduced by carvedilol). Another trial end point, total mortality and all-cause hospitalization, did not show a significant improvement.
 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>There was also a significant 40% reduction in fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction observed in the group treated with carvedilol (95% CI: 11% to 60%, 
  <content styleCode="italics">P</content>= 0.01). A similar reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction was also observed in a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials of carvedilol in heart failure.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial evaluated the blood pressure-lowering effects of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg once daily in 338 subjects with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥90 and ≤109 mm Hg). Of 337 evaluable subjects, a total of 273 subjects (81%) completed the trial. Of the 64 (19%) subjects withdrawn from the trial, 10 (3%) were due to adverse events, 10 (3%) were due to lack of efficacy; the remaining 44 (13%) withdrew for other reasons. The mean age of the subjects was approximately 53 years, 66% were male, and the mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP at baseline were 150 mm Hg and 99 mm Hg, respectively. Dose titration occurred at 2-week intervals.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Statistically significant reductions in blood pressure as measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were observed with each dose of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules compared with placebo. Placebo-subtracted mean changes from baseline in mean SBP/DBP were –6.1/–4.0 mm Hg, –9.4/–7.6 mm Hg, and –11.8/–9.2 mm Hg for carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively. Placebo-subtracted mean changes from baseline in mean trough (average of hours 20 to 24) SBP/DBP were –3.3/–2.8 mm Hg, –4.9/–5.2 mm Hg, and –8.4/–7.4 mm Hg for carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively. The placebo-corrected trough-to-peak (3 to 7 hr) ratio was approximately 0.6 for carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules 80 mg. In this trial, assessments of 24-hour ABPM monitoring demonstrated statistically significant blood pressure reductions with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules throughout the dosing period (Figure 5).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Immediate-release carvedilol was studied in 2 placebo-controlled trials that utilized twice-daily dosing at total daily doses of 12.5 to 50 mg. In these and other trials, the starting dose did not exceed 12.5 mg. At 50 mg/day, carvedilol tablets reduced sitting trough (12-hour) blood pressure by about 9/5.5 mm Hg; at 25 mg/day the effect was about 7.5/3.5 mm Hg. Comparisons of trough-to-peak blood pressure showed a trough-to-peak ratio for blood pressure response of about 65%. Heart rate fell by about 7.5 beats/minute at 50 mg/day. In general, as is true for other beta-blockers, responses were smaller in black than non-black subjects. There were no age- or gender-related differences in response. The dose-related blood pressure response was accompanied by a dose-related increase in adverse effects

                        <paragraph>In a double-blind trial (GEMINI), carvedilol, added to an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, was evaluated in a population with mild-to-moderate hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.2%. Carvedilol tablets were titrated to a mean dose of 17.5 mg twice daily and maintained for 5 months. Carvedilol tablets had no adverse effect on glycemic control, based on HbA1c measurements (mean change from baseline of 0.02%, 95% CI: –0.06 to 0.10,

                     <content styleCode="bold">What is high blood pressure (hypertension)?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Blood pressure is the force of blood in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too much. High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood through the body and causes damage to blood vessels. Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower. Medicines that lower blood pressure may lower your chance of having a stroke or heart attack.</paragraph>
