                        <paragraph>Some endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have caused elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure. Asymptomatic and transient transaminase elevations have been observed with VANRAFIA <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>. Obtain liver enzyme testing before initiating VANRAFIA and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated. In patients with elevated aminotransferases at baseline (&gt;3 × upper limit of normal [ULN]), consider periodic liver test monitoring. Do not initiate VANRAFIA in patients with severe hepatic impairment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Advise patients to report symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, fever, or itching). If clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur, or if elevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin &gt;2 x ULN, or by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity, discontinue VANRAFIA. Consider re-initiation of VANRAFIA when hepatic enzyme levels normalize in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity or jaundice.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on data from animal reproductive toxicity studies, VANRAFIA may cause fetal harm, including birth defects and fetal death, when administered to a pregnant patient and is contraindicated during pregnancy <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)]</content>. There are no available data on VANRAFIA use in pregnancy to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Available data from published literature and post-marketing surveillance over decades of use with products in the same pharmacologic class (ERA) have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects. However, these data are limited and do not establish the presence or absence of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects. Methodological limitations of these post marketing reports and published literature include lack of a control group; limited information regarding dose, duration, and timing of exposure; and missing data. These limitations preclude establishing a reliable estimate of the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes with maternal endothelin receptor antagonist use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of atrasentan to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis at doses that were below the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on area under the curve (AUC) caused teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. Advise pregnant patients of the potential risk to the fetus <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (4.1)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In embryo-fetal development studies in pregnant rats and rabbits, teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal toxicity were observed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pregnant rats, oral administration of atrasentan throughout organogenesis at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg/day resulted in developmental abnormalities primarily including the ear, lower jaw, or skull in all treated groups with detectable plasma exposures to atrasentan. The no adverse effect level of atrasentan plasma exposure was not determined. In pregnant rabbits, oral administration of atrasentan throughout organogenesis at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/day resulted in visceral malformations including deformities in the cardiovascular system in all atrasentan-treated groups. The lowest detectable plasma exposures to atrasentan were approximately 0.2 times the AUC at the MRHD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the pre- and postnatal development study in rats, atrasentan was orally administered to pregnant rats at doses of 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day during the period from gestation Day 15 through lactation Day 20. No adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development were observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day which resulted in maternal exposure approximately 55 times the AUC at the MRHD. Higher exposure to atrasentan (dose of 100 mg/kg/day) increased pup mortality during the pre-weaning period, and increased heart weight which correlated histologically with myocardial hypertrophy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Atrasentan is an ET<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist (Ki = 0.034 nM) with &gt;1800-fold selectivity for the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor compared to the endothelin type B receptor (Ki = 63.3 nM).

                        <paragraph>In a fertility study, male rats were treated with atrasentan at doses of 5, 20, and 60 mg/kg/day and mated with untreated female rats. No adverse effects on male fertility were observed at 5 mg/kg/day, approximately 53 times the AUC at the MRHD. At higher doses, decreased numbers of implantation sites, reduced viable fetuses, and increased pre-implantation loss were observed in the untreated female rats mated with the treated male rats. These effects were reversible at 20 mg/kg/day, approximately 422 times the AUC at MRHD. In rats and dogs, testicular degeneration, dilatation of seminiferous tubules, interstitial edema of the testes, and prostate inflammation were observed at all doses tested, and a no adverse effect dose level could not be determined.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a female rat fertility study, no reproductive toxicity was observed following oral administration during premating, mating, and early gestation at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effect of VANRAFIA on proteinuria was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, global study (ALIGN, NCT04573478) in adults with biopsy-proven primary IgAN, an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and urine protein ≥ 1 g/day on a stable dose of maximally tolerated renin angiotensin system inhibitor. The study included two cohorts: a main cohort of 340 patients and an exploratory cohort of 64 patients who were also on a stable dose of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) at baseline. Patients with chronic kidney disease due to another condition in addition to IgAN or those who had been recently treated with systemic immunosuppressants were excluded. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either VANRAFIA 0.75 mg or placebo once daily. RAS inhibitor therapy was continued throughout the study. Rescue immunosuppressive treatment could be initiated per investigator discretion during the trial.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy analysis included the first 270 patients in the main cohort who reached the Week 36 visit. At baseline, the mean age was 45 years (range: 19 to 77 years); 59% were male, 36% White, 57% Asian, 2% Black or African American and 5% other or not specified. At baseline, 60% had a history of hypertension, 1.5% had a history of type 2 diabetes, and 45% had hematuria based on urine dipstick. The mean baseline eGFR was 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The geometric mean baseline UPCR was 1.5 g/g sampled from a 24-hour urine and 15% of patients had proteinuria &gt; 3.5 g/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the percent reduction in UPCR at Week 36 relative to baseline (see Table 2).</paragraph>
