                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID1963">There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin- associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt;5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID2014">Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a multiple-dose crossover study, 23 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were administered either metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 2,000 mg once a day (after dinner) or metformin HCl tablets 1,000 mg twice a day (after breakfast and after dinner). After 4 weeks of treatment, steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), time to peak plasma concentration (T 
  <sub>max</sub>), and maximum concentration (C 
  <sub>max</sub>) were evaluated. The appearance of metformin in plasma from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is slower and more prolonged compared to metformin HCl tablets. Results are presented in Table 3.
 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>In four single-dose studies and one multiple-dose study, the bioavailability of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 2,000 mg given once daily, in the evening, under fed conditions [as measured by AUC] was similar to the same total daily dose administered as metformin HCl tablets 1,000 mg given twice daily. The geometric mean ratios (metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets / metformin HCL tablets) of AUC 
  <sub>0-24hr</sub>, AUC 
  <sub>0-72hr</sub>, and AUC 
  <sub>0-inf</sub>for these five studies ranged from 0.96 to 1.08.
 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a single-dose, four-period replicate crossover design study, comparing two 500 mg metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets to one 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet administered in the evening with food to 29 healthy male subjects, two 500 mg metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets were found to be equivalent to one 1,000 mg metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study carried out with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, there was a dose-associated increase in metformin exposure over 24 hours following oral administration of 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, and 2,500 mg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In three studies with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets using different treatment regimens (2,000 mg after dinner; 1,000 mg after breakfast and after dinner; and 2,500 mg after dinner), the pharmacokinetics of metformin as measured by AUC appeared linear following multiple-dose administration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Effect of food</content>: The extent of metformin absorption (as measured by AUC) from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets increased by approximately 60% when given with food. When metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets were administered with food, C 
  <sub>max</sub>was increased by approximately 30% and T 
  <sub>max</sub>was more prolonged compared with the fasting state (6.1 versus 4.0 hours).

                        <paragraph>Renal clearance (see Table 4) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.</paragraph>
