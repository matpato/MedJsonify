                     <text>
                        <paragraph>There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil citrate tablets, should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status. The evaluation of erectile dysfunction should include a determination of potential underlying causes and the identification of appropriate treatment following a complete medical assessment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sildenafil has systemic vasodilatory properties that resulted in transient decreases in supine blood pressure in healthy volunteers (mean maximum decrease of 8.4/5.5 mmHg), [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_9009E10E-1B27-4578-86DC-4B41A9C9F920">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>
                           </content>]. While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing sildenafil citrate tablets, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects, especially in combination with sexual activity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use with caution in patients with the following underlying conditions which can be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators including sildenafil citrate tablets â those with left ventricular outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis, idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) and those with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including sildenafil citrate tablets, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely post-marketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5-11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged â¥ 50. An observational case-crossover study evaluated the risk of NAION when PDE5 inhibitor use, as a class, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION, with a risk estimate of 2.15 (95% CI 1.06, 4.34). A similar study reported a consistent result, with a risk estimate of 2.27 (95% CI 0.99, 5.20). Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of âcrowdedâ optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION in these studies. Neither the rare post-marketing reports, nor the association of PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION in the observational studies, substantiate a causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_7d8d6196-98ae-4d30-bdd8-af977c5ed1cb">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</linkHtml>
                           </content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil citrate tablets, should be used with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with âcrowdedâ optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population, however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil citrate tablets, for this uncommon condition.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no controlled clinical data on the safety or efficacy of sildenafil citrate tablets in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (a minority of these patients have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases); if prescribed, this should be done with caution.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>There have been post-marketing reports of bleeding events in patients who have taken sildenafil citrate. A causal relationship between sildenafil citrate and these events has not been established. In humans, sildenafil citrate tablets have no effect on bleeding time when taken alone or with aspirin. However, <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies with human platelets indicate that sildenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor). In addition, the combination of heparin and sildenafil citrate had an additive effect on bleeding time in the anesthetized rabbit, but this interaction has not been studied in humans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of sildenafil citrate tablets is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Sildenafil citrate was administered to over 3700 patients (aged 19-87 years) during pre-marketing clinical trials worldwide. Over 550 patients were treated for longer than one year.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In placebo-controlled clinical studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions for sildenafil citrate (2.5%) was not significantly different from placebo (2.3%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In fixed-dose studies, the incidence of some adverse reactions increased with dose. The type of adverse reactions in flexible-dose studies, which reflect the recommended dosage regimen, was similar to that for fixed-dose studies. At doses above the recommended dose range, adverse reactions were similar to those detailed in Table 1 below but generally were reported more frequently.</paragraph>

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil citrate without sexual activity.

                        <paragraph>Co-administration of ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, greatly increased the systemic exposure of sildenafil (11-fold increase in AUC).

Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole could be expected to have greater effects than seen with saquinavir.

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sildenafil enhances the effect of NO by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum. When sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil at recommended doses has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> have shown that sildenafil is selective for PDE5. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases (10-fold for PDE6, &gt;80-fold for PDE1, &gt;700-fold for PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9, PDE10, and PDE11). Sildenafil is approximately 4,000-fold more selective for PDE5 compared to PDE3. PDE3 is involved in control of cardiac contractility. Sildenafil is only about 10-fold as potent for PDE5 compared to PDE6, an enzyme found in the retina which is involved in the phototransduction pathway of the retina. This lower selectivity is thought to be the basis for abnormalities related to color vision [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_9009E10E-1B27-4578-86DC-4B41A9C9F920">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>In addition to human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, PDE5 is also found in other tissues including platelets, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle, brain, heart, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, bladder, testis, and seminal vesicle. The inhibition of PDE5 in some of these tissues by sildenafil may be the basis for the enhanced platelet antiaggregatory activity of NO observed <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>, an inhibition of platelet thrombus formation <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> and peripheral arterial-venous dilatation <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content>.</paragraph>

Most studies assessed the efficacy of sildenafil citrate approximately 60 minutes post dose.

                        <paragraph>Blood pressure was measured immediately pre-dose and at 15, 30, 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours after sildenafil citrate or matching placebo. Outliers were defined as subjects with a standing systolic blood pressure of &lt;85 mmHg or a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of &gt;30 mmHg at one or more timepoints. There were no subjects treated with sildenafil citrate 25 mg who had a standing SBP &lt;85 mmHg. There were three subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP &gt;30 mmHg following sildenafil citrate 25 mg, one subject with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP &gt;30 mmHg following placebo and two subjects with a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP &gt;30 mmHg following both sildenafil citrate and placebo. No severe adverse events potentially related to blood pressure effects were reported in this group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the four subjects who received sildenafil citrate 100 mg in the first part of this study, a severe adverse event related to blood pressure effect was reported in one patient (postural hypotension that began 35 minutes after dosing with sildenafil citrate with symptoms lasting for 8 hours), and mild adverse events potentially related to blood pressure effects were reported in two others (dizziness, headache and fatigue at 1 hour after dosing; and dizziness, lightheadedness and nausea at 4 hours after dosing). There were no reports of syncope among these patients. For these four subjects, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline in supine and standing systolic blood pressures were 14.8 mmHg and 21.5 mmHg, respectively. Two of these subjects had a standing SBP &lt;85 mmHg. Both of these subjects were protocol violators, one due to a low baseline standing SBP, and the other due to baseline orthostatic hypotension.</paragraph>

In dose period 1, subjects were administered open-label doxazosin and a single dose of sildenafil citrate 50 mg simultaneously, after at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin. If a subject did not successfully complete this first dosing period, he was discontinued from the study. Subjects who had successfully completed the previous doxazosin interaction study (using sildenafil citrate 50 mg), including no significant hemodynamic adverse events, were allowed to skip dose period 1. Treatment with doxazosin continued for at least 7 days after dose period 1. Thereafter, sildenafil citrate 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (14 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (6 subjects) in standard crossover fashion.

The primary endpoint was time to limiting angina in the evaluable cohort. The mean times (adjusted for baseline) to onset of limiting angina were 423.6 and 403.7 seconds for sildenafil (N=70) and placebo, respectively. These results demonstrated that the effect of sildenafil citrate on the primary endpoint was statistically non-inferior to placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Sildenafil citrate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with a mean absolute bioavailability of 41% (range 25-63%). The pharmacokinetics of sildenafil are dose-proportional over the recommended dose range. It is eliminated predominantly by hepatic metabolism (mainly CYP3A4) and is converted to an active metabolite with properties similar to the parent, sildenafil. Both sildenafil and the metabolite have terminal half lives of about 4 hours.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Mean sildenafil plasma concentrations measured after the administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg to healthy male volunteers is depicted below:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Sildenafil citrate is rapidly absorbed. Maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When sildenafil citrate is taken with a high fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced, with a mean delay in T<sub>max</sub> of 60 minutes and a mean reduction in C<sub>max</sub> of 29%. The mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) for sildenafil is 105 L, indicating distribution into the tissues. Sildenafil and its major circulating N-desmethyl metabolite are both approximately 96% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding is independent of total drug concentrations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Based upon measurements of sildenafil in semen of healthy volunteers 90 minutes after dosing, less than 0.001% of the administered dose may appear in the semen of patients.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sildenafil is cleared predominantly by the CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route) hepatic microsomal isoenzymes. The major circulating metabolite results from N-desmethylation of sildenafil, and is itself further metabolized. This metabolite has a PDE selectivity profile similar to sildenafil and an <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> potency for PDE5 approximately 50% of the parent drug. Plasma concentrations of this metabolite are approximately 40% of those seen for sildenafil, so that the metabolite accounts for about 20% of sildenafilâs pharmacologic effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After either oral or intravenous administration, sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose). Similar values for pharmacokinetic parameters were seen in normal volunteers and in the patient population, using a population pharmacokinetic approach.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over) had a reduced clearance of sildenafil, resulting in approximately 84% and 107% higher plasma AUC values of sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite, respectively, compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years). Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in the AUC of free (unbound) sildenafil and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were 45% and 57%, respectively [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_2750d3f9-a31c-4bd2-b74a-8892f1043a47">Dosage and Administration (2.5)</linkHtml>, and <linkHtml href="#ID_06D2F748-40BC-487A-A188-F7A9B1393FF7">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>Sildenafil metabolism is principally mediated by CYP3A4 (major route) and CYP2C9 (minor route). Therefore, inhibitors of these isoenzymes may reduce sildenafil clearance and inducers of these isoenzymes may increase sildenafil clearance. The concomitant use of erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole) as well as the nonspecific CYP inhibitor, cimetidine, is associated with increased plasma levels of sildenafil [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_464f20ad-91e5-450a-bb09-61e6c22b6d79">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>Cimetidine (800 mg), a nonspecific CYP inhibitor, caused a 56% increase in plasma sildenafil concentrations when co-administered with sildenafil citrate (50 mg) to healthy volunteers.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When a single 100 mg dose of sildenafil citrate was administered with erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid for 5 days), there was a 160% increase in sildenafil C<sub>max</sub> and a 182% increase in sildenafil AUC. In addition, in a study performed in healthy male volunteers, co-administration of the HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir, also a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at steady state (1200 mg tid) with sildenafil citrate (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 140% increase in sildenafil C<sub>max</sub> and a 210% increase in sildenafil AUC. Sildenafil citrate had no effect on saquinavir pharmacokinetics. A stronger CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ketoconazole or itraconazole could be expected to have greater effect than that seen with saquinavir. Population pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials also indicated a reduction in sildenafil clearance when it was co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine) [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_464f20ad-91e5-450a-bb09-61e6c22b6d79">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_28dd5b12-b407-4026-a421-b85607fd69f2">Drug Interactions (7.4)</linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>In another study in healthy male volunteers, co-administration with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is a highly potent P450 inhibitor, at steady state (500 mg bid) with sildenafil citrate (100 mg single dose) resulted in a 300% (4-fold) increase in sildenafil C<sub>max</sub> and a 1000% (11-fold) increase in sildenafil plasma AUC. At 24 hours the plasma levels of sildenafil were still approximately 200 ng/mL, compared to approximately 5 ng/mL when sildenafil was dosed alone. This is consistent with ritonavirâs marked effects on a broad range of P450 substrates. Sildenafil citrate had no effect on ritonavir pharmacokinetics [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_464f20ad-91e5-450a-bb09-61e6c22b6d79">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_28dd5b12-b407-4026-a421-b85607fd69f2">Drug Interactions (7.4)</linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>In a study of healthy male volunteers, co-administration of sildenafil at steady state (80 mg t.i.d.) with endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan (a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and possibly of CYP2C19) at steady state (125 mg b.i.d.) resulted in a 63% decrease of sildenafil AUC and a 55% decrease in sildenafil C<sub>max</sub>. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, is expected to cause greater decreases in plasma levels of sildenafil.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Single doses of antacid (magnesium hydroxide/aluminum hydroxide) did not affect the bioavailability of sildenafil citrate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In healthy male volunteers, there was no evidence of a clinically significant effect of azithromycin (500 mg daily for 3 days) on the systemic exposure of sildenafil or its major circulating metabolite.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pharmacokinetic data from patients in clinical trials showed no effect on sildenafil pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 inhibitors (such as tolbutamide, warfarin), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), thiazide and related diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. The AUC of the active metabolite, N-desmethyl sildenafil, was increased 62% by loop and potassium-sparing diuretics and 102% by nonspecific beta-blockers. These effects on the metabolite are not expected to be of clinical consequence.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>In clinical studies, sildenafil citrate was assessed for its effect on the ability of men with erectile dysfunction (ED) to engage in sexual activity and in many cases specifically on the ability to achieve and maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity. Sildenafil citrate was evaluated primarily at doses of 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg in 21 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of up to 6 months in duration, using a variety of study designs (fixed dose, titration, parallel, crossover). Sildenafil was administered to more than 3,000 patients aged 19 to 87 years, with ED of various etiologies (organic, psychogenic, mixed) with a mean duration of 5 years. Sildenafil demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in all 21 studies. The studies that established benefit demonstrated improvements in success rates for sexual intercourse compared with placebo.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The effectiveness of sildenafil citrate was evaluated in most studies using several assessment instruments. The primary measure in the principal studies was a sexual function questionnaire (the International Index of Erectile Function - IIEF) administered during a 4-week treatment-free run-in period, at baseline, at follow-up visits, and at the end of double-blind, placebo-controlled, at-home treatment. Two of the questions from the IIEF served as primary study endpoints; categorical responses were elicited to questions about (1) the ability to achieve erections sufficient for sexual intercourse and (2) the maintenance of erections after penetration. The patient addressed both questions at the final visit for the last 4 weeks of the study. The possible categorical responses to these questions were (0) no attempted intercourse, (1) never or almost never, (2) a few times, (3) sometimes, (4) most times, and (5) almost always or always. Also collected as part of the IIEF was information about other aspects of sexual function, including information on erectile function, orgasm, desire, satisfaction with intercourse, and overall sexual satisfaction. Sexual function data were also recorded by patients in a daily diary. In addition, patients were asked a global efficacy question and an optional partner questionnaire was administered.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The effect on one of the major end points, maintenance of erections after penetration, is shown in Figure 6, for the pooled results of 5 fixed-dose, dose-response studies of greater than one month duration, showing response according to baseline function. Results with all doses have been pooled, but scores showed greater improvement at the 50 and 100 mg doses than at 25 mg. The pattern of responses was similar for the other principal question, the ability to achieve an erection sufficient for intercourse. The titration studies, in which most patients received 100 mg, showed similar results. Figure 6 shows that regardless of the baseline levels of function, subsequent function in patients treated with sildenafil citrate was better than that seen in patients treated with placebo. At the same time, on-treatment function was better in treated patients who were less impaired at baseline.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The frequency of patients reporting improvement of erections in response to a global question in four of the randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled fixed dose studies (1797 patients) of 12 to 24 weeks duration is shown in Figure 7. These patients had erectile dysfunction at baseline that was characterized by median categorical scores of 2 (a few times) on principal IIEF questions. Erectile dysfunction was attributed to organic (58%; generally not characterized, but including diabetes and excluding spinal cord injury), psychogenic (17%), or mixed (24%) etiologies. Sixty-three percent, 74%, and 82% of the patients on 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of sildenafil citrate, respectively, reported an improvement in their erections, compared to 24% on placebo. In the titration studies (n=644) (with most patients eventually receiving 100 mg), results were similar.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The patients in studies had varying degrees of ED. One-third to one-half of the subjects in these studies reported successful intercourse at least once during a 4-week, treatment-free run-in period.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In many of the studies, of both fixed dose and titration designs, daily diaries were kept by patients. In these studies, involving about 1600 patients, analyses of patient diaries showed no effect of sildenafil citrate on rates of attempted intercourse (about 2 per week), but there was clear treatment-related improvement in sexual function: per patient weekly success rates averaged 1.3 on 50-100 mg of sildenafil citrate vs 0.4 on placebo; similarly, group mean success rates (total successes divided by total attempts) were about 66% on sildenafil citrate vs about 20% on placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>During 3 to 6 months of double-blind treatment or longer-term (1 year), open-label studies, few patients withdrew from active treatment for any reason, including lack of effectiveness. At the end of the long-term study, 88% of patients reported that sildenafil citrate improved their erections.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Men with untreated ED had relatively low baseline scores for all aspects of sexual function measured (again using a 5-point scale) in the IIEF. Sildenafil citrate improved these aspects of sexual function: frequency, firmness and maintenance of erections; frequency of orgasm; frequency and level of desire; frequency, satisfaction and enjoyment of intercourse; and overall relationship satisfaction.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>One randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study included only patients with erectile dysfunction attributed to complications of diabetes mellitus (n=268). As in the other titration studies, patients were started on 50 mg and allowed to adjust the dose up to 100 mg or down to 25 mg of sildenafil citrate; all patients, however, were receiving 50 mg or 100 mg at the end of the study. There were highly statistically significant improvements on the two principal IIEF questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) on sildenafil citrate compared to placebo. On a global improvement question, 57% of sildenafil citrate patients reported improved erections versus 10% on placebo. Diary data indicated that on sildenafil citrate, 48% of intercourse attempts were successful versus 12% on placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>One randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, flexible-dose (up to 100 mg) study of patients with erectile dysfunction resulting from spinal cord injury (n=178) was conducted. The changes from baseline in scoring on the two end point questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) were highly statistically significantly in favor of sildenafil citrate. On a global improvement question, 83% of patients reported improved erections on sildenafil citrate versus 12% on placebo. Diary data indicated that on sildenafil citrate, 59% of attempts at sexual intercourse were successful compared to 13% on placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Across all trials, sildenafil citrate improved the erections of 43% of radical prostatectomy patients compared to 15% on placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Subgroup analyses of responses to a global improvement question in patients with psychogenic etiology in two fixed-dose studies (total n=179) and two titration studies (total n=149) showed 84% of sildenafil citrate patients reported improvement in erections compared with 26% of placebo. The changes from baseline in scoring on the two end point questions (frequency of successful penetration during sexual activity and maintenance of erections after penetration) were highly statistically significantly in favor of sildenafil citrate. Diary data in two of the studies (n=178) showed rates of successful intercourse per attempt of 70% for sildenafil citrate and 29% for placebo.</paragraph>

Concomitant administration of sildenafil citrate tablets and an alpha-blocker may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. Therefore, when sildenafil citrate tablets are co-administered with alpha-blockers, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil citrate tablets treatment and sildenafil citrate tablets should be initiated at the lowest dose [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_c68505e6-af71-4c3c-96f2-054cb07a3a03">Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</linkHtml>

                  <paragraph>Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil citrate tablets, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a cause of decreased vision including possible permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely post-marketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Physicians should discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION in individuals who have already experienced NAION in one eye. Physicians should also discuss with patients the increased risk of NAION among the general population in patients with a âcrowdedâ optic disc, although evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitor, including sildenafil citrate tablets, for this uncommon condition [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_9b6d9d6f-65e5-4db4-bb48-e98f68439172">Warnings and Precautions (5.3)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_7d8d6196-98ae-4d30-bdd8-af977c5ed1cb">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</linkHtml>
