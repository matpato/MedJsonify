                     <content styleCode="bold">SAVELLA is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), similar to some drugs used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders. Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of such drugs in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on SAVELLA should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. SAVELLA is not approved for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder. SAVELLA is not approved for use in pediatric patients <content styleCode="italics">[see Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#_1_INDICATIONS_AND">1</linkHtml>), Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#_5_1_Suicide_Risk">5.1</linkHtml>), Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#_8_4_Pediatric_Use">8.4</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with SAVELLA is unclear. The clinician should nevertheless be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#_5_2_Serotonin_Syndrome">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>SAVELLA is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor (SNRI), similar to some drugs used for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients, both adult and pediatric, with depression or other psychiatric disorders may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking these medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants, including drugs that inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin, may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the placebo-controlled clinical trials of adults with fibromyalgia, among the patients who had a history of depression at treatment initiation, the incidence of suicidal ideation was 0.5% in patients treated with placebo, 0% in patients treated with SAVELLA 100 mg/day, and 1.3% in patients treated with SAVELLA 200 mg/day. No suicides occurred in the short-term or longer-term (up to 1 year) fibromyalgia trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of drugs used to treat depression (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with these drugs compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in suicidality risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults age 65 and older.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 drugs used to treat depression in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug versus placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in <content styleCode="bold">Table 1</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients who may experience worsening depressive symptoms, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe or abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment due to worsening depressive symptoms or emergent suicidality, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can produce withdrawal symptoms <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#_2_1_Recommended_Dosing">2.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#_2_4_Discontinuing_Savella">2.4</linkHtml>), Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#_5_7_Discontinuation_of">5.7</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Families and caregivers of patients being treated with drugs inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for SAVELLA should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A double-blind, placebo-controlled ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) study was conducted to evaluate the effects of milnacipran (up to 200 mg/day) on blood pressure in 321 fibromyalgia patients. Among fibromyalgia patients who were normotensive at baseline, an analysis of the blood pressure findings demonstrated a substantially higher proportion of SAVELLA-treated patients had a hypertensive blood pressure measurement at the Week 4, 50 mg BID steady state visit (17.7% [n=21/119]) and the Week 7, 100 mg BID steady state visit (14.3% [n=15/105]) as compared to placebo-treated patients (3.7% [n=2/54] and 0% [0/49] at the Week 4 and Week 7 visits, respectively). Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg and change from baseline in mean SBP ≥10 mmHg or mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg and change from baseline in mean DBP ≥5 mmHg for the 12-hour period post AM study drug measurement at that visit. Furthermore, 1.9% (4/210) of SAVELLA-treated and 0.9% (1/111) of placebo patients discontinued treatment for increases in blood pressure. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of blood pressure measurements in the hypertensive range in SAVELLA-treated patients is supported by substantial increases in mean SBP and DBP measurements observed in the ABPM study. <content styleCode="bold">Table 2</content> shows that, following treatment with SAVELLA 50 mg BID for three weeks in patients who were normotensive at baseline, the mean increase from baseline was 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). After further treatment with SAVELLA 100 mg BID for two weeks, the mean increase from baseline in SBP and DBP was 6 mmHg. Similar elevations occurred in SAVELLA-treated patients who were hypertensive at baseline.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A double-blind, placebo-controlled ABPM study was conducted to evaluate the effects of milnacipran (up to 200 mg/day) on blood pressure in 321 fibromyalgia patients <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#_5_3__Elevated">5.3</linkHtml>)]</content>. Information on heart rate was also collected. Following treatment with SAVELLA 50mg BID for three weeks in patients who were normotensive at baseline, the mean increase in mean 24-hour heart rate from baseline was 13 beats per minute. After further treatment with SAVELLA 100 mg BID for two weeks, the mean increase from baseline in heart rate was 13 beats per minute.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Similar trends were observed in the clinical trials where SAVELLA treatment was associated with mean increases in heart rate of approximately 7 to 8 beats per minute <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#_6_1_Clinical_Trials">6.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Increases in heart rate ≥ 20 beats per minute occurred more frequently in SAVELLA-treated patients when compared to placebo (8% in the SAVELLA 50 mg BID and 100 mg BID treatment arms versus 0.3% in the placebo arm). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>SAVELLA has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a cardiac rhythm disorder.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>SAVELLA has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. In clinical trials evaluating SAVELLA in patients with fibromyalgia, seizures/convulsions have not been reported. However, seizures have been reported infrequently in patients treated with SAVELLA for disorders other than fibromyalgia. SAVELLA should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of a seizure disorder.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Withdrawal symptoms have been observed in clinical trials following discontinuation of milnacipran, as with other SNRIs and SSRIs. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During marketing of milnacipran, and other SNRIs and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events indicative of withdrawal and physical dependence occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when discontinuation is abrupt. The adverse events include the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor patients for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with SAVELLA. SAVELLA should be tapered after extended use. Do not abruptly discontinue. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#_2_4_Discontinuing_Savella">2.4</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including SAVELLA. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs, SSRIs, or SAVELLA. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted may be at greater risk <content styleCode="italics">[see Geriatric Use (<linkHtml href="#_8_5_Geriatric_Use">8.5</linkHtml>)]</content>. Consider discontinuation of SAVELLA in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because of their noradrenergic effect, SNRIs including SAVELLA, can affect urethral resistance and micturition. In the controlled fibromyalgia trials, dysuria occurred more frequently in patients treated with SAVELLA (1%) than in placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Caution is advised in use of SAVELLA in patients with a history of dysuria, notably in male patients with prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis, and other lower urinary tract obstructive disorders. Male patients are more prone to genitourinary adverse effects, such as dysuria or urinary retention, and may experience testicular pain or ejaculation disorders.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>There is no specific antidote to SAVELLA, but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment (such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. In case of acute overdose, treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdose with any drug.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ensure adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation and monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. Because there is no specific antidote for SAVELLA, consider symptomatic care and treatment with gastric lavage and activated charcoal as soon as possible for patients who experience a SAVELLA overdose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Due to the large volume of distribution of this drug, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In managing overdose, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose.

                        <paragraph>The exact mechanism of the central pain inhibitory action of milnacipran and its ability to improve the symptoms of fibromyalgia in humans are unknown. Preclinical studies have shown that milnacipran is a potent inhibitor of neuronal norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake; milnacipran inhibits norepinephrine uptake with approximately 3-fold higher potency in vitro than serotonin without directly affecting the uptake of dopamine or other neurotransmitters. Milnacipran has no significant affinity for serotonergic (5-HT1-7), α- and β-adrenergic, muscarinic (M1-5), histamine (H1-4), dopamine (D1-5), opiate, benzodiazepine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in vitro. Pharmacologic activity at these receptors is hypothesized to be associated with the various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects seen with other psychotropic drugs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Milnacipran has no significant affinity for Ca++, K+, Na+ and Cl– channels and does not inhibit the activity of human monoamine oxidases (MAO-A and MAO-B) or acetylcholinesterase.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Milnacipran is well absorbed after oral administration with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 85% to 90%. The exposure to milnacipran increased proportionally within the therapeutic dose range. It is excreted predominantly unchanged in urine (55%) and has a terminal elimination half-life of about 6 to 8 hours. Steady-state levels are reached within 36 to 48 hours and can be predicted from single-dose data. The active enantiomer, <content styleCode="italics">d</content>-milnacipran, has a longer elimination half-life (8-10 hours) than the <content styleCode="italics">l</content>-enantiomer (4-6 hours). There is no interconversion between the enantiomers.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Vitro Studies:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In general, milnacipran, at concentrations that were at least 25 times those attained in clinical trials, did not inhibit human CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 or induce human CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 enzyme systems, indicating a low potential of interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies have shown that the biotransformation rate of milnacipran by human hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes was low. A low biotransformation was also observed following incubation of milnacipran with cDNA-expressed human CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 isozymes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Vivo Studies:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The drug interaction studies described in this section were conducted in healthy adult subjects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carbamazepine- There were no clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of milnacipran following co-administration of SAVELLA (100 mg/day) and carbamazepine (200 mg twice a day). No changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or its epoxide metabolite due to co-administration with SAVELLA.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clomipramine- Switching from clomipramine (75 mg once a day) to milnacipran (100 mg/day) without a washout period did not lead to clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of milnacipran. Because an increase in adverse events (eg, euphoria and postural hypotension) was observed after switching from clomipramine to milnacipran, monitoring of patients during treatment switch is recommended.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Digoxin- There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between SAVELLA (200 mg/day) and digoxin (0.2 mg/day Lanoxicaps) following multiple-dose administration to healthy subjects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fluoxetine- Switching from fluoxetine (20 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19, to milnacipran (100 mg/day) without a washout period did not affect the pharmacokinetics of milnacipran.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lithium- Multiple doses of SAVELLA (100 mg/day) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of lithium.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lorazepam- There was no pharmacokinetic interaction between a single dose of SAVELLA (50 mg) and lorazepam (1.5 mg).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pregabalin- There were no clinically significant changes in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of milnacipran or pregabalin following twice a day co-administration of 50 mg milnacipran and 150 mg pregabalin.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Warfarin- Steady-state milnacipran (200 mg/day) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of R-warfarin and S-warfarin or the pharmacodynamics (as assessed by measurement of prothrombin INR) of a single dose of 25 mg warfarin. The pharmacokinetics of SAVELLA were not altered by warfarin.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The efficacy of SAVELLA for the management of fibromyalgia was established in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies in adult patients (18-74 years of age). Enrolled patients met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for fibromyalgia (a history of widespread pain for 3 months and pain present at 11 or more of the 18 specific tender point sites). Approximately 35% of patients had a history of depression. Study 1 was six months in duration and Study 2 was three months in duration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A larger proportion of patients treated with SAVELLA than with placebo experienced a simultaneous reduction in pain from baseline of at least 30% (VAS) and also rated themselves as much improved or very much improved based on the patient global assessment (PGIC). In addition, a larger proportion of patients treated with SAVELLA met the criteria for treatment response, as measured by the composite endpoint that concurrently evaluated improvement in pain (VAS), physical function (SF-36 PCS), and patient global assessment (PGIC), in fibromyalgia as compared to placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 1: This 6-month study compared total daily doses of SAVELLA 100 mg and 200 mg to placebo. Patients were enrolled with a minimum mean baseline pain score of ≥ 50 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 100 (“worst possible pain”). The mean baseline pain score in this trial was 69. The efficacy results for Study 1 are summarized in <content styleCode="bold">Figure 1</content>.</paragraph>
