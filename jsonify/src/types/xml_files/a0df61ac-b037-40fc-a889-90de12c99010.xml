                        <paragraph>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including lansoprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than nondrug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving lansoprazole delayed-release capsules discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in four to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop lansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see <content styleCode="bold">Drug Interactions <linkHtml href="#_RefS7"> (7)</linkHtml>, Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#S12.2">12.2</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Available data from published observational studies overall do not indicate an association of adverse pregnancy outcomes with lansoprazole treatment (see Data). Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lansoprazole to rats during organogenesis through lactation at 6.4 times the maximum recommended human dose produced reductions in the offspring in femur weight, femur length, crown-rump length and growth plate thickness (males only) on postnatal Day 21 (see Data). These effects were associated with reduction in body weight gain. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.Â  Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> If lansoprazole delayed-release capsules are administered with clarithromycin, the pregnancy information for clarithromycin also applies to the combination regimen. Refer to the prescribing information for clarithromycin for more information on use in pregnancy. Â  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and lansoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospectiveÂ study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 62 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 30 mg of lansoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any PPIs. There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a Relative Risk (RR)=1.04, [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.25 to 4.21]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to lansoprazole in 794 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations Odds Ratio (OR)=1.12, [95% CI 0.86 to 1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR=1.29, [95% CI 0.84 to 1.97]).Â  Â  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No adverse effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in studies performed in pregnant rats at oral lansoprazole doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (40 times the recommended human dose [30 mg/day] based on body surface area) administered during organogenesis and pregnant rabbits at oral lansoprazole doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) administered during organogenesis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with lansoprazole at oral doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg/day (0.7 to 6.4 times the maximum recommended human lansoprazole dose of 30 mg based on AUC [area under the plasma concentration-time curve]) administered during organogenesis through lactation. Maternal effects observed at 100 mg/kg/day (6.4 times the maximum recommended human lansoprazole dose of 30 mg based on AUC) included increased gestation period, decreased body weight gain during gestation, and decreased food consumption. The number of stillbirths was increased at this dose, which may have been secondary to maternal toxicity. Body weight of pups was reduced at 100 mg/kg/day starting on postnatal Day 11. Femur weight, femur length, and crown-rump length were reduced at 100 mg/kg/day on postnatal Day 21. Femur weight was still decreased in the 100 mg/kg/day group at age 17 to 18 weeks. Growth plate thickness was decreased in the 100 mg/kg/day males on postnatal Day 21, and was increased in the 30 and 100 mg/kg/day males at age 17 to 18 weeks. The effects on bone parameters were associated with reduction in body weight gain.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules have been established in pediatric patients one year to 17 years of age for short-term treatment of symptomatic GERD and erosive esophagitis. In clinical studies of symptomatic GERD and erosive esophagitis, lansoprazole was not administered beyond 12 weeks in patients one year to 11 years of age. It is not known if lansoprazole delayed-release capsules are safe and effective if used longer than the recommended duration. Do not exceed the recommended dose and duration of use in pediatric patients (see Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lansoprazole was not effective in pediatric patients with symptomatic GERD one month to less than one year of age in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Therefore, safety and effectiveness have not been established in patients less than one year of age. Nonclinical studies in juvenile rats have demonstrated an adverse effect of heart valve thickening and bone changes at lansoprazole doses higher than the maximum recommended equivalent human dose.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> The pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were studied in pediatric patients with GERD aged less than 28 days and one to 11 months. Compared to healthy adults receiving 30 mg, neonates had higher exposure (mean weight-based normalized AUC values 2.04 and 1.88 fold higher at doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day, respectively). Infants aged â¤10 weeks had clearance and exposure values that were similar to neonates. Infants aged greater than 10 weeks who received 1 mg/kg/day had mean AUC values that were similar to adults who received a 30 mg dose. Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Lansoprazole was not found to be effective in a U.S. and Polish four week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 162 patients between one month and less than 12 months of age with symptomatic GERD based on a medical history of crying/fussing/irritability associated with feedings who had not responded to conservative GERD management (i.e., nonpharmacologic intervention) for seven to 14 days. Patients received lansoprazole as a suspension daily (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in infants â¤10 weeks of age or 1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day in infants greater than 10 weeks or placebo) for up to four weeks of double-blind treatment. Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was assessed by greater than 50% reduction from baseline in either the percent of feedings with a crying/fussing/irritability episode or the duration (minutes) of a crying/fussing/irritability episode within one hour after feeding. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There was no difference in the percentage of responders between the lansoprazole pediatric suspension group and placebo group (54% in both groups). Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> There were no adverse events reported in pediatric clinical studies (one month to less than 12 months of age) that were not previously observed in adults. Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Based on the results of the Phase 3 efficacy study, lansoprazole was not shown to be effective. Therefore, these results do not support the use of lansoprazole in treating symptomatic GERD in infants. Â  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> In an uncontrolled, open-label, U.S. multicenter study, 66 pediatric patients (one year to 11 years of age) with GERD were assigned, based on body weight, to receive an initial dose of either lansoprazole delayed-release capsules 15 mg daily if â¤ 30 kg or lansoprazole delayed-release capsules 30 mg daily if greater than 30 kg administered for eight to 12 weeks. The lansoprazole delayed-release capsules dose was increased (up to 30 mg twice daily) in 24 of 66 pediatric patients after two or more weeks of treatment if they remained symptomatic. At baseline, 85% of patients had mild to moderate overall GERD symptoms (assessed by investigator interview), 58% had non-erosive GERD and 42% had erosive esophagitis (assessed by endoscopy). Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> After eight to 12 weeks of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules treatment, the intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated an approximate 50% reduction in frequency and severity of GERD symptoms. Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Twenty one of 27 erosive esophagitis patients were healed at eight weeks and 100% of patients were healed at 12 weeks by endoscopy (Table 4). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In two oral toxicity studies, thickening of the mitral heart valve occurred in juvenile rats treated with lansoprazole. Heart valve thickening was observed primarily with oral dosing initiated on postnatal Day 7 (age equivalent to neonatal humans) and postnatal Day 14 (human age equivalent of approximately one year) at doses of 250 mg/kg/day and higher (at postnatal Day 7 and postnatal Day 14, respectively 6.2 times and 4.2 times the daily pediatric dose of 15 mg in pediatric patients age one to 11 years weighing 30 kg or less, based on AUC). The treatment durations associated with heart valve thickening ranged from 5 days to 8 weeks. The findings reversed or trended towards reversibility after a 4-week drug-free recovery period. The incidence of heart valve thickening after initiation of dosing on postnatal Day 21 (human age equivalent of approximately two years) was limited to a single rat (1/24) in groups given 500 mg/kg/day for 4 or 8 weeks (approximately 5.2 times the daily pediatric dose of 15 mg in pediatric patients age one to 11 years weighing 30 kg or less, based on AUC). Based on exposure margins, the risk of heart valve injury does not appear to be relevant to patients one year of age and older. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In an eight-week oral toxicity study in juvenile rats with dosing initiated on postnatal Day 7, doses equal to or greater than 100 mg/kg/day (2.5 times the daily pediatric dose of 15 mg in children age one to 11 years weighing 30 kg or less, based on AUC) produced delayed growth, with impairment of weight gain observed as early as postnatal Day 10 (age equivalent to neonatal humans). At the end of treatment, the signs of impaired growth at 100 mg/kg/day and higher included reductions in body weight (14 to 44% compared to controls), absolute weight of multiple organs, femur weight, femur length, and crown-rump length. Femoral growth plate thickness was reduced only in males and only at the 500 mg/kg/day dose. The effects related to delayed growth persisted through the end of the four-week recovery period. Longer term data were not collected.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Lansoprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the (H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, lansoprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. Lansoprazole does not exhibit anticholinergic or histamine type-2 antagonist activity. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>After oral administration, lansoprazole was shown to significantly decrease the basal acid output and significantly increase the mean gastric pH and percent of time the gastric pH was greater than three and greater than four. Lansoprazole also significantly reduced meal-stimulated gastric acid output and secretion volume, as well as pentagastrin-stimulated acid output. In patients with hypersecretion of acid, lansoprazole significantly reduced basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Lansoprazole inhibited the normal increases in secretion volume, acidity and acid output induced by insulin. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Lansoprazole did not significantly affect mucosal blood flow in the fundus of the stomach. Due to the normal physiologic effect caused by the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, a decrease of about 17% in blood flow in the antrum, pylorus, and duodenal bulb was seen. Lansoprazole significantly slowed the gastric emptying of digestible solids. Lansoprazole increased serum pepsinogen levels and decreased pepsin activity under basal conditions and in response to meal stimulation or insulin injection. As with other agents that elevate intragastric pH, increases in gastric pH were associated with increases in nitrate-reducing bacteria and elevation of nitrite concentration in gastric juice in patients with gastric ulcer. No significant increase in nitrosamine concentrations was observed. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules contain an enteric-coated granule formulation of lansoprazoleÂ (because lansoprazole is acid-labile), so thatÂ absorption of lansoprazole begins only after the granules leave the stomach. The mean peak plasma levels of lansoprazole occur at approximately 1.7 hours. After a single-dose administration of 15 to 60 mg of oral lansoprazole, the peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) of lansoprazole and the area under the plasma concentration curves (AUCs) of lansoprazole were approximately proportional to the administered dose. Lansoprazole does not accumulate and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered by multiple dosing. The absolute bioavailability is over 80%. In healthy subjects, the mean (Â±SD) plasma half-life was 1.5 (Â±1) hours. Both the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC are diminished by about 50 to 70% if lansoprazole is given 30 minutes after food, compared to the fasting condition. There is no significant food effect if lansoprazole is given before meals. Â  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Metabolism:</content> Lansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver. Two metabolites have been identified in measurable quantities in plasma (the hydroxylated sulfinyl and sulfone derivatives of lansoprazole). These metabolites have very little or no antisecretory activity. Lansoprazole is thought to be transformed into two active species which inhibit acid secretion by blocking the proton pump [(H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>)-ATPase enzyme system] at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. The two active species are not present in the systemic circulation. The plasma elimination half-life of lansoprazole is less than two hours while the acid inhibitory effect lasts more than 24 hours. Therefore, the plasma elimination half-life of lansoprazole does not reflect its duration of suppression of gastric acid secretion. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Excretion:</content> Following single-dose oral administration of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, virtually no unchanged lansoprazole was excreted in the urine. In one study, after a single oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C-lansoprazole, approximately one-third of the administered radiation was excreted in the urine and two-thirds was recovered in the feces. This implies a significant biliary excretion of the lansoprazole metabolites. <content styleCode="bold">Â </content>

                        <paragraph> The pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were studied in pediatric patients with GERD aged one to 11 years and 12 to 17 years in two separate clinical studies. In children aged one to 11 years, lansoprazole was dosed 15 mg daily for subjects weighing â¤ 30 kg and 30 mg daily for subjects weighing greater than 30 kg. Mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values observed on Day 5 of dosing were similar between the two dose groups and were not affected by weight or age within each weight-adjusted dose group used in the study. In adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years, subjects were randomized to receive lansoprazole at 15 or 30 mg daily. Mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values of lansoprazole were not affected by body weight or age; and nearly dose-proportional increases in mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values were observed between the two dose groups in the study. Overall, lansoprazole pharmacokinetics in pediatric patients aged one to 17 years were similar to those observed in healthy adult subjects. Â  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> The clearance of lansoprazole is decreased in the elderly, with elimination half-life increased approximately 50 to 100%. Because the mean half-life in the elderly remains between 1.9 to 2.9 hours, repeated once daily dosing does not result in accumulation of lansoprazole. Peak plasma levels were not increased in the elderly.

                        <paragraph> In patients with severe renal impairment, plasma protein binding decreased by 1 to 1.5% after administration of 60 mg of lansoprazole. Patients with renal impairment had a shortened elimination half-life and decreased total AUC (free and bound). The AUC for free lansoprazole in plasma, however, was not related to the degree of renal impairment; and the C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> (time to reach the maximum concentration) were not different than the C<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>max </sub>from subjects with normal renal function. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were not clinically different in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function.

                        <paragraph> Lansoprazole is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system, specifically through the CYP3A and CYP2C19 isozymes. Studies have shown that lansoprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P<sub>450</sub> system, such as warfarin, antipyrine, indomethacin, ibuprofen, phenytoin, propranolol, prednisone, diazepam, or clarithromycin in healthy subjects. These compounds are metabolized through various cytochrome P<sub>450</sub> isozymes including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Â  </paragraph>

The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 14% (mean AUC ratio was 86%, with 90% CI of 80 to 92%) when lansoprazole delayed-release capsules was coadministered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.

                        <paragraph>In two, 24 month carcinogenicity studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with oral lansoprazole doses of 5 to 150 mg/kg/day, about one to 40 times the exposure on a body surface (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis of a 50 kg person of average height [1.46 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (BSA)] given the recommended human dose of 30 mg/day. Lansoprazole produced dose-related gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia and ECL cell carcinoids in both male and female rats. It also increased the incidence of intestinal metaplasia of the gastric epithelium in both sexes. In male rats, lansoprazole produced a dose-related increase of testicular interstitial cell adenomas. The incidence of these adenomas in rats receiving doses of 15 to 150 mg/kg/day (four to 40 times the recommended human dose based on BSA) exceeded the low background incidence (range = 1.4 to 10%) for this strain of rat. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 24 month carcinogenicity study, CD-1 mice were treated with oral lansoprazole doses of 15 to 600 mg/kg/day, two to 80 times the recommended human dose based on BSA. Lansoprazole produced a dose-related increased incidence of gastric ECL cell hyperplasia. It also produced an increased incidence of liver tumors (hepatocellular adenoma plus carcinoma). The tumor incidences in male mice treated with 300 and 600 mg/kg/day (40 to 80 times the recommended human dose based on BSA) and female mice treated with 150 to 600 mg/kg/day (20 to 80 times the recommended human dose based on BSA) exceeded the ranges of background incidences in historical controls for this strain of mice. Lansoprazole treatment produced adenoma of rete testis in male mice receiving 75 to 600 mg/kg/day (10 to 80 times the recommended human dose based on BSA). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A 26 week p53 (+/-) transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study was not positive. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lansoprazole was positive in the Ames test and the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay. Lansoprazole was not genotoxic in the ex vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test, the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, or the rat bone marrow cell chromosomal aberration test. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lansoprazole at oral doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (40 times the recommended human dose based on BSA) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response (15, 30, and 60 mg of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules once daily) study of 284 patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer, the percentage of patients healed after two and four weeks was significantly higher with all doses of lansoprazole than with placebo. There was no evidence of a greater or earlier response with the two higher doses compared with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules 15 mg. Based on this study and the second study described below, the recommended dose of lansoprazole in duodenal ulcer is 15 mg per day (Table 9). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules 15 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in relieving day and nighttime abdominal pain and in decreasing the amount of antacid taken per day. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a second U.S. multicenter study, also double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-comparison (15 and 30 mg of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules once daily), and including a comparison with ranitidine, in 280 patients with endoscopically documented duodenal ulcer, the percentage of patients healed after four weeks was significantly higher with both doses of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules than with placebo. There was no evidence of a greater or earlier response with the higher dose of lansoprazole. Although the 15 mg dose of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules was superior to ranitidine at four weeks, the lack of significant difference at two weeks and the absence of a difference between 30 mg of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules and ranitidine leaves the comparative effectiveness of the two agents undetermined (Table 10) [see <content styleCode="bold">Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#S1.1">1.1</linkHtml>)</content>].Â </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph> Randomized, double-blind clinical studies performed in the U.S. in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within one year) evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin as triple 14 day therapy or in combination with amoxicillin as dual 14 day therapy for the eradication of H. pylori. Based on the results of these studies, the safety and efficacy of two different eradication regimens were established: </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Triple therapy: Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules 30 mg twice daily / amoxicillin 1 g twice daily / clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Dual therapy: Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules 30 mg three times daily / amoxicillin 1 g three times daily </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All treatments were for 14 days. H. pylori eradication was defined as two negative tests (culture and histology) at four to six weeks following the end of treatment. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Triple therapy was shown to be more effective than all possible dual therapy combinations. Dual therapy was shown to be more effective than both monotherapies. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A randomized, double-blind clinical study performed in the U.S. in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within one year) compared the efficacy of lansoprazole triple therapy for 10 and 14 days. This study established that the 10 day triple therapy was equivalent to the 14 day triple therapy in eradicating H. pylori (<content styleCode="bold">Tables 11 and 12</content>)Â [see <content styleCode="bold">Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#_941bc712-4c84-f470-10eb-b8d6be515e68">1.2</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Lansoprazole has been shown to prevent the recurrence of duodenal ulcers. Two independent, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trials were conducted in patients with endoscopically confirmed healed duodenal ulcers. Patients remained healed significantly longer and the number of recurrences of duodenal ulcers was significantly less in patients treated with lansoprazole than in patients treated with placebo over a 12 month period (Table 13) [see <content styleCode="bold">Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#S1.3">1.3</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In two U.S. and Canadian multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with endoscopically confirmed NSAID-associated gastric ulcer who continued their NSAID use, the percentage of patients healed after eight weeks was statistically significantly higher with 30 mg of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules than with the active control. A total of 711 patients were enrolled in the study, and 701 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 18 to 88 years (median age 59 years), with 67% female patients and 33% male patients. Race was distributed as follows: 87% Caucasian, 8% Black, 5% Other. There was no statistically significant difference between lansoprazole delayed-release capsules 30 mg daily and the active control on symptom relief (i.e., abdominal pain) (Table 15) [see <content styleCode="bold">Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#S1.5">1.5</linkHtml>)</content>].Â </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph> In one large U.S., multicenter, double-blind, placebo-and misoprostol-controlled (misoprostol blinded only to the endoscopist) study in patients who required chronic use of an NSAID and who had a history of an endoscopically documented gastric ulcer, the proportion of patients remaining free from gastric ulcer at four, eight, and 12 weeks was significantly higher with 15 or 30 mg of lansoprazole than placebo. A total of 537 patients were enrolled in the study, and 535 patients were treated. Patients ranged in age from 23 to 89 years (median age 60 years), with 65% female patients and 35% male patients. Race was distributed as follows: 90% Caucasian, 6% Black, 4% Other. The 30 mg dose of lansoprazole demonstrated no additional benefit in risk reduction of the NSAID-associated gastric ulcer than the 15 mg dose (Table 16) [see <content styleCode="bold">Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#S1.6">1.6</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In two U.S., multi-center double-blind, ranitidine-controlled studies of 925 total patients with frequent GERD symptoms, but no esophageal erosions by endoscopy, lansoprazole 15 mg was superior to ranitidine 150 mg (twice daily) in decreasing the frequency and severity of day and night heartburn associated with GERD for the eight week treatment period. No significant additional benefit from lansoprazole 30 mg once daily was observed.

                        <paragraph> â  (pâ¤0.05) vs lansoprazole 15 mg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this study, all lansoprazole groups reported significantly greater relief of heartburn and less day and night abdominal pain along with fewer days of antacid use and fewer antacid tablets taken per day than the placebo group. Although all doses were effective, the earlier healing in the higher two doses suggests 30 mg daily as the recommended dose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lansoprazole was also compared in a U.S. multicenter, double-blind study to a low dose of ranitidine in 242 patients with erosive reflux esophagitis. Lansoprazole at a dose of 30 mg was significantly more effective than ranitidine 150 mg twice daily as shown below (Table 19). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> In addition, patients treated with lansoprazole reported less day and nighttime heartburn and took less antacid tablets for fewer days than patients taking ranitidine 150 mg twice daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although this study demonstrates effectiveness of lansoprazole in healing erosive esophagitis, it does not represent an adequate comparison with ranitidine because the recommended ranitidine dose for esophagitis is 150 mg four times daily, twice the dose used in this study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In the two trials described and in several smaller studies involving patients with moderate to severe erosive esophagitis, lansoprazole produced healing rates similar to those shown above. Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled study, 30 mg of lansoprazole was compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in 151 patients with erosive reflux esophagitis that was poorly responsive to a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with at least one H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist given at the dose indicated for symptom relief or greater, namely, cimetidine 800 mg/day, ranitidine 300 mg/day, famotidine 40 mg/day or nizatidine 300 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Lansoprazole 30 mg was more effective than ranitidine 150 mg twice daily in healing reflux esophagitis, and the percentage of patients with healing were as follows. This study does not constitute a comparison of the effectiveness of histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists with lansoprazole, as all patients had demonstrated unresponsiveness to the histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist mode of treatment. It does indicate, however, that lansoprazole may be useful in patients failing on a histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist (Table 20) [see <content styleCode="bold">Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#S1.7">1.7</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a U.S., randomized, double-blind, study, lansoprazole 15 mg daily (n = 100) was compared with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily (n = 106), at the recommended dosage, in patients with endoscopically-proven healed erosive esophagitis over a 12 month period. Treatment with lansoprazole resulted in patients remaining healed (Grade 0 lesions) of erosive esophagitis for significantly longer periods of time than those treated with ranitidine (p&lt;0.001). In addition, lansoprazole was significantly more effective than ranitidine in providing complete relief of both daytime and nighttime heartburn. Patients treated with lansoprazole remained asymptomatic for a significantly longer period of time than patients treated with ranitidine [see <content styleCode="bold">Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#S1.9">1.9</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In open studies of 57 patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with or without multiple endocrine adenomas, lansoprazole significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion and controlled associated symptoms of diarrhea, anorexia and pain. Doses ranging from 15 mg every other day to 180 mg per day maintained basal acid secretion below 10 mEq/hr in patients without prior gastric surgery and below 5 mEq/hr in patients with prior gastric surgery. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Initial doses were titrated to the individual patient need, and adjustments were necessary with time in some patients [see <content styleCode="bold">Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#S2.1">2.1</linkHtml>)</content>].Â Lansoprazole was well-tolerated at these high-dose levels for prolonged periods (greater than four years in some patients). In most ZES patients, serum gastrin levels were not modified by lansoprazole. However, in some patients, serum gastrin increased to levels greater than those present prior to initiation of lansoprazole therapy [see <content styleCode="bold">Indications and Usage (<linkHtml href="#_57dcc08f-cde9-c13c-685a-ae74e5cdeaba">1.10</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>
