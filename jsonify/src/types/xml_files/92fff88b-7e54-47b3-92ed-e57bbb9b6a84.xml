Post-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6–MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants [see <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#s5.2">5.2</linkHtml>)</content>].</content>

Methotrexate (MTX), other non-biologic DMARDS, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and/or analgesics may be continued during treatment with YUSIMRY. In the treatment of RA, some patients not taking concomitant MTX may derive additional benefit from increasing the dosage of YUSIMRY to 40 mg every week or 80 mg every other week.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>YUSIMRY is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician. A patient may self- inject YUSIMRY or a caregiver may inject YUSIMRY using either the YUSIMRY pen or prefilled syringe if a physician determines that it is appropriate, and with medical follow-up, as necessary, after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>YUSIMRY can be taken out of the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes before injecting to allow the liquid to come to room temperature. Do not remove the cap or cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Carefully inspect the solution in the YUSIMRY pen or prefilled syringe for particulate matter and discoloration prior to subcutaneous administration. If particulates and discolorations are noted, do not use the product. YUSIMRY does not contain preservatives; therefore, discard unused portions of drug remaining from the syringe <content styleCode="italics">[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (<linkHtml href="#s16">16</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Instruct patients using the YUSIMRY pen or prefilled syringe to inject the full amount in the syringe, according to the directions provided in the Instructions for Use [see <content styleCode="italics">
                              <linkHtml href="#sifu">Instructions for Use</linkHtml>
                           </content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen. Rotate injection sites and do not give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at the regular scheduled time.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients treated with adalimumab products, including YUSIMRY, are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death. Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The concomitant use of a TNF blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); therefore, the concomitant use of YUSIMRY and these biologic products is not recommended in the treatment of patients with RA [see <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#s5.7">5.7</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#s5.11">5.11</linkHtml>) and Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#s7.2">7.2</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with YUSIMRY should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. Patients 65 years of age and older, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (such as corticosteroids or methotrexate), may be at greater risk of infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating therapy in patients:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis and new onset tuberculosis infections have been reported in patients receiving adalimumab products, including patients who have previously received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating YUSIMRY and periodically during therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating YUSIMRY, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of ≥ 5 mm a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of YUSIMRY in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Despite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with adalimumab products. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Strongly consider tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis in patients who develop a new infection during YUSIMRY treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.</paragraph>

Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with YUSIMRY.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Discontinue YUSIMRY if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. For a patient who develops a new infection during treatment with YUSIMRY, closely monitor them, perform a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>If patients develop a serious systemic illness and they reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, consider invasive fungal infection in the differential diagnosis. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. Consider appropriate empiric antifungal therapy, taking into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy, while a diagnostic workup is being performed. To aid in the management of such patients, consider consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-blockers, including adalimumab products, more cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated adult patients compared to control-treated adult patients. During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), plaque psoriasis (Ps), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and uveitis (UV), malignancies, other than non-melanoma (basal cell and squamous cell) skin cancer, were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.7 (0.48, 1.03) per 100 patient-years among 7973 adalimumab- treated patients versus a rate of 0.7 (0.41, 1.17) per 100 patient-years among 4848 control-treated patients (median duration of treatment of 4 months for adalimumab-treated patients and 4 months for control-treated patients). In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the most frequently observed malignancies, other than lymphoma and NMSC, were breast, colon, prostate, lung, and melanoma. The malignancies in adalimumab-treated patients in the controlled and uncontrolled portions of the studies were similar in type and number to what would be expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).<sup>1</sup>

                        <paragraph>During the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, the rate (95% confidence interval) of NMSC was 0.8 (0.52, 1.09) per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.2 (0.10, 0.59) per 100 patient-years among control-treated patients. Examine all patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of prior prolonged immunosuppressant therapy or psoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment for the presence of NMSC prior to and during treatment with YUSIMRY.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF-blockers in adults, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among TNF-blocker-treated patients compared to control-treated patients. In the controlled portions of 39 global adalimumab clinical trials in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV, 2 lymphomas occurred among 7973 adalimumab-treated patients versus 1 among 4848 control-treated patients. In 52 global controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials of adalimumab in adult patients with RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS, and UV with a median duration of approximately 0.7 years, including 24,605 patients and over 40,215 patient-years of adalimumab, the observed rate of lymphomas was approximately 0.11 per 100 patient-years. This is approximately 3-fold higher than expected in the general U.S. population according to the SEER database (adjusted for age, gender, and race).<sup>1</sup> Rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of adalimumab cannot be compared to rates of lymphoma in clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at a higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blockers. Post-marketing cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2- fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blockers (initiation of therapy ≤ 18 years of age), of which YUSIMRY
is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers including adalimumab products. These cases have had a very aggressive disease course and have been fatal. The majority of reported TNF blocker cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and the majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all of these patients had received treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (6–MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants. The potential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and YUSIMRY should be carefully considered.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4 Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Use of TNF blockers, including YUSIMRY, may increase the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. Evaluate patients at risk for HBV infection for prior evidence of HBV infection before initiating TNF blocker therapy. Exercise caution in prescribing TNF blockers for patients identified as carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. For patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF blockers, closely monitor such patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, stop YUSIMRY and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of YUSIMRY therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Use of TNF blocking agents, including adalimumab products, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Exercise caution in considering the use of YUSIMRY in patients with pre-existing or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of YUSIMRY should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between intermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders.</paragraph>

(e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been infrequently reported with adalimumab products. The causal relationship of these reports to adalimumab products remains unclear. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g., persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on YUSIMRY. Consider discontinuation of YUSIMRY therapy in patients with confirmed significant hematologic abnormalities.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with RA, no difference was detected in anti- pneumococcal antibody response between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with adalimumab. Similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of anti-influenza antibodies between adalimumab and placebo treatment groups; however, titers in aggregate to influenza antigens were moderately lower in patients receiving adalimumab. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Patients on YUSIMRY may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving adalimumab products.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The most common adverse reaction with adalimumab was injection site reactions. In placebo- controlled trials, 20% of patients treated with adalimumab developed injection site reactions (erythema and/or itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling), compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo. Most injection site reactions were described as mild and generally did not necessitate drug discontinuation.</paragraph>

In a subgroup of 10,113 U.S. and Canadian adalimumab-treated patients, the rate of reported active TB was 0.05 per 100 patient-years and the rate of positive PPD conversion was 0.07 per 100 patient-years. These trials included reports of miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary TB. Most of the TB cases occurred within the first eight months after initiation of therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease. In these global clinical trials, cases of serious opportunistic infections have been reported at an overall rate of 0.05 per 100 patient-years.

                        <paragraph>There have been reports of severe hepatic reactions including acute liver failure in patients receiving TNF-blockers. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (40 mg SC every other week) in patients with RA, PsA, and AS with control period duration ranging from 4 to 104 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 3.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control-treated patients. Since many of these patients in these trials were also taking medications that cause liver enzyme elevations (e.g., NSAIDS, MTX), the relationship between adalimumab and the liver enzyme elevations is not clear. In a controlled Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 4 to 17 years, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 4.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.5% of control- treated patients (ALT more common than AST); liver enzyme test elevations were more frequent among those treated with the combination of adalimumab and MTX than those treated with adalimumab alone. In general, these elevations did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment. No ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in the open-label study of adalimumab in patients with polyarticular JIA who were 2 to &lt;4 years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg, or 80 mg and 40 mg on Days 1 and 15, respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with Crohn's Disease with a control period duration ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.9% of adalimumab-treated patients and 0.9% of control-treated patients. In the Phase 3 trial of adalimumab in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease which evaluated efficacy and safety of two body weight based maintenance dose regimens following body weight based induction therapy up to 52 weeks of treatment, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.6% (5/192) of patients, of whom 4 were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants at baseline; none of these patients discontinued due to abnormalities in ALT tests. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg and 80 mg on Days 1 and 15 respectively, followed by 40 mg every other week) in adult patients with UC with control period duration ranging from 1 to 52 weeks, ALT elevations ≥3 x ULN occurred in 1.5% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.0% of control-treated patients. In controlled Phase 3 trials of adalimumab (initial dose of 80 mg then 40 mg every other week) in patients with Ps with control period duration ranging from 12 to 24 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 1.8% of adalimumab-treated patients and 1.8% of control-treated patients. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 160 mg at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, followed by 40 mg every week starting at Week 4), in subjects with HS with a control period duration ranging from 12 to 16 weeks, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 0.3% of adalimumab-treated subjects and 0.6% of control-treated subjects. In controlled trials of adalimumab (initial doses of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1) in adult patients with uveitis with an exposure of 165.4 PYs and 119.8 PYs in adalimumab-treated and control-treated patients, respectively, ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of adalimumab-treated patients and 2.4% of control-treated patients.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In general, the adverse reactions in the adalimumab-treated patients in the polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) trials (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) [see <content styleCode="italics">Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#s14.2">14.2</linkHtml>)</content>] were similar in frequency and type to those seen in adult patients [see <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#s5">5</linkHtml>), Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#s6">6</linkHtml>)</content>]. Important findings and differences from adults are discussed in the following paragraphs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study JIA-I, adalimumab was studied in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age, with polyarticular JIA. Severe adverse reactions reported in the study included neutropenia, streptococcal pharyngitis, increased aminotransferases, herpes zoster, myositis, metrorrhagia, and appendicitis. Serious infections were observed in 4% of patients within approximately 2 years of initiation of treatment with adalimumab and included cases of herpes simplex, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis, and herpes zoster.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study JIA-I, 45% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab with or without concomitant MTX in the first 16 weeks of treatment. The types of infections reported in adalimumab- treated patients were generally similar to those commonly seen in polyarticular JIA patients who are not treated with TNF blockers. Upon initiation of treatment, the most common adverse reactions occurring in this patient population treated with adalimumab were injection site pain and injection site reaction (19% and 16%, respectively). A less commonly reported adverse event in patients receiving adalimumab was granuloma annulare which did not lead to discontinuation of adalimumab treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the first 48 weeks of treatment in Study JIA-I, non-serious hypersensitivity reactions were seen in approximately 6% of patients and included primarily localized allergic hypersensitivity reactions and allergic rash.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study JIA-I, 10% of patients treated with adalimumab who had negative baseline anti-dsDNA antibodies developed positive titers after 48 weeks of treatment. No patient developed clinical signs of autoimmunity during the clinical trial.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 15% of patients treated with adalimumab developed mild-to-moderate elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in Study JIA-I. Elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in several patients. CPK concentrations decreased or returned to normal in all patients. Most patients were able to continue adalimumab without interruption.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study JIA-II, adalimumab was studied in 32 patients who were 2 to &lt;4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing &lt;15 kg with polyarticular JIA. The safety profile for this patient population was similar to the safety profile seen in patients 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study JIA-II, 78% of patients experienced an infection while receiving adalimumab. These included nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, and were mostly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections were observed in 9% of patients receiving adalimumab in the study and included dental caries, rotavirus gastroenteritis, and varicella.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study JIA-II, non-serious allergic reactions were observed in 6% of patients and included intermittent urticaria and rash, which were all mild in severity.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other adalimumab products may be misleading.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are two assays that have been used to measure anti-adalimumab antibodies. With the ELISA, antibodies to adalimumab could be detected only when serum adalimumab concentrations were &lt; 2 mcg/mL. The ECL assay can detect anti-adalimumab antibody titers independent of adalimumab concentrations in the serum samples. The incidence of anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) development in patients treated with adalimumab are presented in <linkHtml href="#t2">Table 2</linkHtml>.</paragraph>

No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse reactions was observed. With monotherapy, patients receiving every other week dosing may develop antibodies more frequently than those receiving weekly dosing. In patients receiving the recommended dosage of 40 mg every other week as monotherapy, the ACR 20 response was lower among antibody-positive patients than among antibody-negative patients.

                        <paragraph>In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of YUSIMRY with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see <content styleCode="italics">Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#s5.7">5.7</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#s5.11">5.11</linkHtml>)</content>]. A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of YUSIMRY and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of YUSIMRY with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of YUSIMRY in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available studies with use of adalimumab during pregnancy do not reliably establish an association between adalimumab and major birth defects. Clinical data are available from the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS)/MotherToBaby Pregnancy Registry in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn's disease (CD) treated with adalimumab. Registry results showed a rate of 10% for major birth defects with first trimester use of adalimumab in pregnant women with RA or CD and a rate of 7.5% for major birth defects in the disease-matched comparison cohort. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects (see <content styleCode="italics">

In an embryo-fetal perinatal development study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, no fetal harm or malformations were observed with intravenous administration of adalimumab during organogenesis and later in gestation, at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 373 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg subcutaneous without methotrexate (see <content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>A prospective cohort pregnancy exposure registry conducted by OTIS/MotherToBaby in the U.S. and Canada between 2004 and 2016 compared the risk of major birth defects in live-born infants of 221 women (69 RA, 152 CD) treated with adalimumab during the first trimester and 106 women (74 RA, 32 CD) not treated with adalimumab.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportion of major birth defects among live-born infants in the adalimumab-treated and untreated cohorts was 10% (8.7% RA, 10.5% CD) and 7.5% (6.8% RA, 9.4% CD), respectively. The lack of pattern of major birth defects is reassuring and differences between exposure groups may have impacted the occurrence of birth defects. This study cannot reliably establish whether there is an association between adalimumab and major birth defects because of methodological limitations of the registry, including small sample size, the voluntary nature of the study, and the non-randomized design.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an independent clinical study conducted in ten pregnant women with IBD treated with adalimumab, adalimumab concentrations were measured in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (n=10) and infant serum (n=8) on the day of birth. The last dose of adalimumab was given between 1 and 56 days prior to delivery. Adalimumab concentrations were 0.16-19.7 mcg/mL in cord blood, 4.28-17.7 mcg/mL in infant serum, and 0-16.1 mcg/mL in maternal serum. In all but one case, the cord blood concentration of adalimumab was higher than the maternal serum concentration, suggesting adalimumab actively crosses the placenta. In addition, one infant had serum concentrations at each of the following: 6 weeks (1.94 mcg/mL), 7 weeks (1.31 mcg/mL), 8 weeks (0.93 mcg/mL), and 11 weeks (0.53 mcg/mL), suggesting adalimumab can be detected in the serum of infants exposed in utero for at least 3 months from birth.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Limited data from case reports in the published literature describe the presence of adalimumab in human milk at infant doses of 0.1% to 1% of the maternal serum concentration. Published data suggest that the systemic exposure to a breastfed infant is expected to be low because adalimumab is a large molecule and is degraded in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the effects of local exposure in the gastrointestinal tract are unknown. There are no reports of adverse effects of adalimumab products on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for YUSIMRY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from YUSIMRY or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>dalimumab products bind specifically to TNF-alpha and block its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab products also lyse surface TNF expressing cells <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> in the presence of complement. Adalimumab products do not bind or inactivate lymphotoxin (TNF-beta). TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elevated concentrations of TNF are found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA, JIA, PsA, and AS and play an important role in both the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased concentrations of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In Ps, treatment with YUSIMRY may reduce the epidermal thickness and infiltration of inflammatory cells.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism(s) by which adalimumab products exert their clinical effects is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adalimumab products also modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1-2 X 10<sup>-10</sup>M).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>After treatment with adalimumab, a decrease in concentrations of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and serum cytokines (IL-6) was observed compared to baseline in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A decrease in CRP concentrations was also observed in patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Serum concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-3) that produce tissue remodeling responsible for cartilage destruction were also decreased after adalimumab administration.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of adalimumab were linear over the dose range of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg following administration of a single intravenous dose (adalimumab products are not approved for intravenous use). Following 20, 40, and 80 mg every other week and every week subcutaneous administration, adalimumab mean serum trough concentrations at steady state increased approximately proportionally with dose in RA patients. The mean terminal half-life was approximately 2 weeks, ranging from 10 to 20 days across studies. Healthy subjects and patients with RA displayed similar adalimumab pharmacokinetics.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adalimumab exposure in patients treated with 80 mg every other week is estimated to be comparable with that in patients treated with 40 mg every week.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of adalimumab were assessed in five randomized, double-blind studies in patients ≥18 years of age with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had at least 6 swollen and 9 tender joints. Adalimumab was administered subcutaneously in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (12.5 to 25 mg, Studies RA-I, RA-III and RA-V) or as monotherapy (Studies RA-II and RA-V) or with other disease- modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Study RA-IV).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study RA-I evaluated 271 patients who had failed therapy with at least one but no more than four DMARDs and had inadequate response to MTX. Doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg of adalimumab or placebo were given every other week for 24 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study RA-II evaluated 544 patients who had failed therapy with at least one DMARD. Doses of placebo, 20 or 40 mg of adalimumab were given as monotherapy every other week or weekly for 26 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study RA-III evaluated 619 patients who had an inadequate response to MTX. Patients received placebo, 40 mg of adalimumab every other week with placebo injections on alternate weeks, or 20 mg of adalimumab weekly for up to 52 weeks. Study RA-III had an additional primary endpoint at
52 weeks of inhibition of disease progression (as detected by X-ray results). Upon completion of the first 52 weeks, 457 patients enrolled in an open-label extension phase in which 40 mg of adalimumab was administered every other week for up to 5 years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study RA-IV assessed safety in 636 patients who were either DMARD-naive or were permitted to remain on their pre-existing rheumatologic therapy provided that therapy was stable for a minimum of 28 days. Patients were randomized to 40 mg of adalimumab or placebo every other week for 24 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study RA-V evaluated 799 patients with moderately to severely active RA of less than 3 years duration who were ≥18 years old and MTX naïve. Patients were randomized to receive either MTX (optimized to 20 mg/week by Week 8), adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab /MTX combination therapy for 104 weeks. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms, and for radiographic progression of joint damage. The median disease duration among patients enrolled in the study was
5 months. The median MTX dose achieved was 20 mg.</paragraph>

Over the 2 years in Study RA-III, 20% of adalimumab patients receiving 40 mg every other week achieved a major clinical response, defined as maintenance of an ACR 70 response over a 6-month period. ACR responses were maintained in similar proportions of patients for up to 5 years with continuous adalimumab treatment in the open-label portion of Study RA-III.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In studies RA-I through IV, adalimumab showed significantly greater improvement than placebo in the disability index of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) from baseline to the end of study, and significantly greater improvement than placebo in the health-outcomes as assessed by The Short Form Health Survey (SF 36). Improvement was seen in both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study RA-III, the mean (95% CI) improvement in HAQ-DI from baseline at Week 52 was 0.60 (0.55, 0.65) for the adalimumab patients and 0.25 (0.17, 0.33) for placebo/MTX (p&lt;0.001) patients. Sixty-three percent of adalimumab-treated patients achieved a 0.5 or greater improvement in HAQ-DI at Week 52 in the double-blind portion of the study. Eighty-two percent of these patients maintained that improvement through Week 104 and a similar proportion of patients maintained this response through Week 260 (5 years) of open-label treatment. Mean improvement in the SF-36 was maintained through the end of measurement at Week 156 (3 years).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study RA-V, the HAQ-DI and the physical component of the SF-36 showed greater improvement (p&lt;0.001) for the adalimumab/MTX combination therapy group versus either the MTX monotherapy or the adalimumab monotherapy group at Week 52, which was maintained through Week 104.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two studies (Studies JIA-I and JIA-II) in patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, withdrawal, double-blind, parallel-group study in 171 patients who were 4 to 17 years of age with polyarticular JIA. In the study, the patients were stratified into two groups: MTX-treated or non-MTX-treated. All patients had to show signs of active moderate or severe disease despite previous treatment with NSAIDs, analgesics, corticosteroids, or DMARDS. Patients who received prior treatment with any biologic DMARDS were excluded from the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The study included four phases: an open-label lead in phase (OL-LI; 16 weeks), a double-blind randomized withdrawal phase (DB; 32 weeks), an open-label extension phase (OLE-BSA; up to
136 weeks), and an open-label fixed dose phase (OLE-FD; 16 weeks). In the first three phases of the study, adalimumab was administered based on body surface area at a dose of 24 mg/m<sup>2</sup> up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg subcutaneously (SC) every other week. In the OLE-FD phase, the patients were treated with 20 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was less than 30 kg and with 40 mg of adalimumab SC every other week if their weight was 30 kg or greater. Patients remained on stable doses of NSAIDs and or prednisone (≤0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day maximum).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients demonstrating a Pediatric ACR 30 response at the end of OL-LI phase were randomized into the double blind (DB) phase of the study and received either adalimumab or placebo every other week for 32 weeks or until disease flare. Disease flare was defined as a worsening of ≥30% from baseline in ≥3 of 6 Pediatric ACR core criteria, ≥2 active joints, and improvement of &gt;30% in no more than 1 of the 6 criteria. After 32 weeks or at the time of disease flare during the DB phase, patients were treated in the open-label extension phase based on the BSA regimen (OLE-BSA), before converting to a fixed dose regimen based on body weight (OLE-FD phase).</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At the end of the 16-week OL-LI phase, 94% of the patients in the MTX stratum and 74% of the patients in the non-MTX stratum were Pediatric ACR 30 responders. In the DB phase significantly fewer patients who received adalimumab experienced disease flare compared to placebo, both without MTX (43% vs. 71%) and with MTX (37% vs. 65%). More patients treated with adalimumab continued to show pediatric ACR 30/50/70 responses at Week 48 compared to patients treated with placebo. Pediatric ACR responses were maintained for up to two years in the OLE phase in patients who received adalimumab throughout the study.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Adalimumab was assessed in an open-label, multicenter study in 32 patients who were 2 to &lt;4 years of age or 4 years of age and older weighing &lt;15 kg with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Most patients (97%) received at least 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment dosed 24 mg/m<sup>2</sup> up to a maximum of 20 mg every other week as a single SC injection up to a maximum of 120 weeks duration. During the study, most patients used concomitant MTX, with fewer reporting use of corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The primary objective of the study was evaluation of safety [see <content styleCode="italics">Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#s6.1">6.1</linkHtml>)</content>]

                     <title>14.3 Psoriatic Arthritis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of adalimumab was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies in 413 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Upon completion of both studies, 383 patients enrolled in an open-label extension study, in which 40 mg adalimumab was administered every other week.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study PsA-I enrolled 313 adult patients with moderately to severely active PsA (&gt;3 swollen and &gt;3 tender joints) who had an inadequate response to NSAID therapy in one of the following forms:
(1) distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement (N=23); (2) polyarticular arthritis (absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of plaque psoriasis) (N=210); (3) arthritis mutilans (N=1); (4) asymmetric PsA (N=77); or (5) AS-like (N=2). Patients on MTX therapy (158 of 313 patients) at enrollment (stable dose of ≤30 mg/week for &gt;1 month) could continue MTX at the same dose. Doses of adalimumab 40 mg or placebo every other week were administered during the 24-week double-blind period of the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Compared to placebo, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvements in the measures of disease activity (see <linkHtml href="#t8">Table 8</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#t9">Table 9</linkHtml>). Among patients with PsA who received adalimumab, the clinical responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks) and were maintained up to 88 weeks in the ongoing open-label study. Similar responses were seen in patients with each of the subtypes of psoriatic arthritis, although few patients were enrolled with the arthritis mutilans and ankylosing spondylitis-like subtypes. Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with psoriatic involvement of at least three percent body surface area (BSA) were evaluated for Psoriatic Area and Severity Index (PASI) responses. At 24 weeks, the proportions of patients achieving a 75% or 90% improvement in the PASI were 59% and 42% respectively, in the adalimumab group (N=69), compared to 1% and 0% respectively, in the placebo group (N=69) (p&lt;0.001). PASI responses were apparent in some patients at the time of the first visit (two weeks). Responses were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX therapy at baseline.</paragraph>

At Weeks 12 and 24, patients treated with adalimumab showed greater improvement from baseline in the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score compared to patients treated with placebo, and no worsening in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score.

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of adalimumab 40 mg every other week was assessed in 315 adult patients in a randomized, 24 week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who had an inadequate response to glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, analgesics, methotrexate or sulfasalazine. Active AS was defined as patients who fulfilled at least two of the following three criteria: (1) a Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) score ≥4 cm, (2) a visual analog score (VAS) for total back pain ≥ 40 mm, and (3) morning stiffness ≥ 1 hour. The blinded period was followed by an open-label period during which patients received adalimumab 40 mg every other week subcutaneously for up to an additional 28 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Improvement in measures of disease activity was first observed at Week 2 and maintained through 24 weeks as shown in <linkHtml href="#fig2">Figure 2</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#t11">Table 11</linkHtml>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Responses of patients with total spinal ankylosis (n=11) were similar to those without total ankylosis.</paragraph>

Similar responses were seen at Week 24 and were sustained in patients receiving open-label adalimumab for up to 52 weeks.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of multiple doses of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, CD, (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥ 220 and ≤ 450) in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and/or immunomodulatory agents were permitted, and 79% of patients continued to receive at least one of these medications.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Induction of clinical remission (defined as CDAI &lt; 150) was evaluated in two studies. In Study CD-I, 299 TNF-blocker naïve patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: the placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0 and 2, the 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, the 80/40 group received 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2, and the 40/20 group received 40 mg at Week 0 and 20 mg at Week 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the second induction study, Study CD-II, 325 patients who had lost response to, or were intolerant to, previous infliximab therapy were randomized to receive either 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, or placebo at Weeks 0 and 2. Clinical results were assessed at Week 4.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Maintenance of clinical remission was evaluated in Study CD-III. In this study, 854 patients with active disease received open-label adalimumab, 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. Patients were then randomized at Week 4 to 40 mg adalimumab every other week, 40 mg adalimumab every week, or placebo. The total study duration was 56 weeks. Patients in clinical response (decrease in CDAI ≥70) at Week 4 were stratified and analyzed separately from those not in clinical response at Week 4.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg adalimumab achieved induction of clinical remission versus placebo at Week 4 regardless of whether the patients were TNF blocker naïve (CD-I), or had lost response to or were intolerant to infliximab (CD-II) (see <linkHtml href="#t12">Table 12</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                     <title>14.6 Pediatric Crohn's Disease</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A randomized, double-blind, 52-week clinical study of 2 dose concentrations of adalimumab (Study PCD-I) was conducted in 192 pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (defined as Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) score &gt; 30). Enrolled patients had over the previous two year period an inadequate response to corticosteroids or an immunomodulator (i.e., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate). Patients who had previously received a TNF blocker were allowed to enroll if they had previously had loss of response or intolerance to that TNF blocker.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients received open-label induction therapy at a dose based on their body weight (≥40 kg and &lt;40 kg). Patients weighing ≥40 kg received 160 mg (at Week 0) and 80 mg (at Week 2). Patients weighing &lt;40 kg received 80 mg (at Week 0) and 40 mg (at Week 2). At Week 4, patients within each body weight category (≥40 kg and &lt;40 kg) were randomized 1:1 to one of two maintenance dose regimens (high dose and low dose). The high dose was 40 mg every other week for patients weighing ≥40 kg and 20 mg every other week for patients weighing &lt;40 kg. The low dose was 20 mg every other week for patients weighing ≥40 kg and 10 mg every other week for patients weighing &lt;40 kg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant stable dosages of corticosteroids (prednisone dosage ≤40 mg/day or equivalent) and immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate) were permitted throughout the study.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At Week 12, patients who experienced a disease flare (increase in PCDAI of ≥ 15 from Week 4 and absolute PCDAI &gt; 30) or who were non-responders (did not achieve a decrease in the PCDAI of ≥ 15 from baseline for 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart) were allowed to dose-escalate (i.e., switch from blinded every other week dosing to blinded every week dosing); patients who dose-escalated were considered treatment failures.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At baseline, 38% of patients were receiving corticosteroids, and 62% of patients were receiving an immunomodulator. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients had previously lost response or were intolerant to a TNF blocker. The median baseline PCDAI score was 40.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the 192 patients total, 188 patients completed the 4 week induction period, 152 patients completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 124 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment. Fifty-one percent (51%) (48/95) of patients in the low maintenance dose group dose-escalated, and 38% (35/93) of patients in the high maintenance dose group dose-escalated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At Week 4, 28% (52/188) of patients were in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI ≤ 10).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The proportions of patients in clinical remission (defined as PCDAI ≤ 10) and clinical response (defined as reduction in PCDAI of at least 15 points from baseline) were assessed at Weeks 26 and 52.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At both Weeks 26 and 52, the proportion of patients in clinical remission and clinical response was numerically higher in the high dose group compared to the low dose group (<linkHtml href="#t14">Table 14</linkHtml>). The recommended maintenance regimen is 20 mg every other week for patients weighing &lt; 40 kg and 40 mg every other week for patients weighing ≥ 40 kg. Every week dosing is not the recommended maintenance dosing regimen [see <content styleCode="italics">Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#s2.3">2.3</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (Mayo score 6 to 12 on a 12 point scale, with an endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 on a scale of 0 to 3) despite concurrent or prior treatment with immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, or 6-MP in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies UC-I and UC-II). Both studies enrolled TNF-blocker naïve patients, but Study UC-II also allowed entry of patients who lost response to or were intolerant to TNF-blockers. Forty percent (40%) of patients enrolled in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were permitted. In Studies UC-I and II, patients were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%) and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%) at baseline. In both studies, 92% of patients received at least one of these medications.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Induction of clinical remission (defined as Mayo score ≤ 2 with no individual subscores &gt; 1) at Week 8 was evaluated in both studies. Clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission (defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) were evaluated in Study UC-II.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study UC-I, 390 TNF-blocker naïve patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups for the primary efficacy analysis. The placebo group received placebo at Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6. The 160/80 group received 160 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 80 mg at Week 2, and the 80/40 group received 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 2. After Week 2, patients in both adalimumab treatment groups received 40 mg every other week.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study UC-II, 518 patients were randomized to receive either adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every other week starting at Week 4 through Week 50, or placebo starting at Week 0 and every other week through Week 50. Corticosteroid taper was permitted starting at Week 8.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In both Studies UC-I and UC-II, a greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to patients treated with placebo achieved induction of clinical remission. In Study UC-II, a greater percentage of the patients treated with 160/80 mg of adalimumab compared to patients treated with placebo achieved sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52) (<linkHtml href="#t15">Table 15</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in 1696 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis (Ps) who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study Ps-I evaluated 1212 subjects with chronic Ps with ≥10% body surface area (BSA) involvement, Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of at least moderate disease severity, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥12 within three treatment periods. In period A, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg at Week 0 followed by a dose of 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1. After 16 weeks of therapy, subjects who achieved at least a PASI 75 response at Week 16, defined as a PASI score improvement of at least 75% relative to baseline, entered period B and received open-label 40 mg adalimumab every other week. After 17 weeks of open label therapy, subjects who maintained at least a PASI 75 response at Week 33 and were originally randomized to active therapy in period A were re-randomized in period C to receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week or placebo for an additional 19 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 19 and the baseline Physician's Global Assessment score ranged from “moderate” (53%) to "severe" (41%) to "very severe" (6%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study Ps-II evaluated 99 subjects randomized to adalimumab and 48 subjects randomized to placebo with chronic plaque psoriasis with ≥10% BSA involvement and PASI ≥12. Subjects received placebo, or an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab at Week 0 followed by 40 mg every other week starting at Week 1 for 16 weeks. Across all treatment groups the mean baseline PASI score was 21 and the baseline PGA score ranged from “moderate” (41%) to "severe" (51%) to "very severe" (8%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies Ps-I and II evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved "clear" or "minimal" disease on the 6-point PGA scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) from baseline at Week 16 (see <linkHtml href="#t16">Table 16</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#t17">Table 17</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Additionally, in Study Ps-I, subjects on adalimumab who maintained a PASI 75 were re-randomized to adalimumab (N = 250) or placebo (N = 240) at Week 33. After 52 weeks of treatment with adalimumab, more subjects on adalimumab maintained efficacy when compared to subjects who were re-randomized to placebo based on maintenance of PGA of "clear" or "minimal" disease (68% <content styleCode="italics">vs.</content> 28%) or a PASI 75 (79% <content styleCode="italics">vs.</content> 43%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 347 stable responders participated in a withdrawal and retreatment evaluation in an open- label extension study. Median time to relapse (decline to PGA "moderate" or worse) was approximately 5 months. During the withdrawal period, no subject experienced transformation to either pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis. A total of 178 subjects who relapsed re-initiated treatment with 80 mg of adalimumab, then 40 mg every other week beginning at Week 1. At Week 16, 69% (123/178) of subjects had a response of PGA "clear" or "minimal".</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A randomized, double-blind study (Study Ps-III) compared the efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo in 217 adult subjects. Subjects in the study had to have chronic plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity on the PGA scale, fingernail involvement of at least moderate severity on a 5- point Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis (PGA-F) scale, a Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) score for the target-fingernail of ≥ 8, and either a BSA involvement of at least 10% or a BSA involvement of at least 5% with a total mNAPSI score for all fingernails of ≥ 20. Subjects received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab followed by 40 mg every other week (starting one week after the initial dose) or placebo for 26 weeks followed by open-label adalimumab treatment for an additional 26 weeks. This study evaluated the proportion of subjects who achieved "clear" or "minimal" assessment with at least a 2-grade improvement on the PGA-F scale and the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the mNAPSI score (mNAPSI 75) at Week 26.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At Week 26, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved the PGA-F endpoint. Furthermore, a higher proportion of subjects in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group achieved mNAPSI 75 at Week 26 (see <linkHtml href="#t18">Table 18</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (Studies HS-I and II) evaluated the safety and efficacy of adalimumab in a total of 633 adult subjects with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) with Hurley Stage II or III disease and with at least 3 abscesses or inflammatory nodules. In both studies, subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and 40 mg every week starting at Week 4 and continued through Week 11. Subjects used topical antiseptic wash daily. Concomitant oral antibiotic use was allowed in Study HS-II.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Both studies evaluated Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at Week 12. HiSCR was defined as at least a 50% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to baseline (see Table 19). Reduction in HS-related skin pain was assessed using a Numeric Rating Scale in patients who entered the study with an initial baseline score of 3 or greater on a 11 point scale. In both studies, a higher proportion of adalimumab- than placebo-treated subjects achieved HiSCR (see <linkHtml href="#t19">Table 19</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was 'time to treatment failure'.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups (<linkHtml href="#t20">Table 20</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
