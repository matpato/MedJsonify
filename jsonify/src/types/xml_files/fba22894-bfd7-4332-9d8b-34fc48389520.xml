Midazolam HCl syrup has been associated with reports of respiratory depression, airway obstruction, desaturation, hypoxia, and apnea, most often when used concomitantly with other central nervous system depressants. Midazolam HCl Syrup should be used only in hospital or ambulatory care settings, including physicians’ and dentists’ offices, that can provide for continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function. Immediate availability of resuscitative drugs and age- and size-appropriate equipment for ventilation and intubation, and personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management should be assured <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_FC7C4F72_40C5_4B31_BA95_7AF27FBA4E25">WARNINGS</linkHtml>]</content>.

                  <paragraph>Midazolam is a benzodiazepine available as midazolam HCl syrup for oral administration. Midazolam, a white to light yellow crystalline compound, is insoluble in water, but can be solubilized in aqueous solutions by formation of the hydrochloride salt <content styleCode="italics">in situ</content> under acidic conditions. Chemically, midazolam HCl is 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4<content styleCode="italics">H</content>-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine hydrochloride. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Midazolam hydrochloride has the molecular formula C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>13</sub>ClFN<sub>3</sub>·HCl, a calculated molecular weight of 362.25 and the following structural formula:</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Each mL of the syrup contains midazolam hydrochloride equivalent to 2 mg midazolam compounded with bitterness modifier, artificial cherry-brandy flavor, citric acid anhydrous, D&amp;C Red #33, edetate disodium, glycerin, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate, sodium saccharin, sorbitol solution, and water; the pH is adjusted to 2.8 to 3.6 with hydrochloric acid.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Under the acidic conditions required to solubilize midazolam in the syrup, midazolam is present as an equilibrium mixture (shown below) of the closed ring form shown above and an open-ring structure formed by the acid-catalyzed ring opening of the 4,5-double bond of the diazepine ring. The amount of open-ring form is dependent upon the pH of the solution. At the specified pH of the syrup, the solution may contain up to about 40% of the open-ring compound. At the physiologic conditions under which the product is absorbed (pH of 5 to 8) into the systemic circulation, any open-ring form present reverts to the physiologically active, lipophilic, closed-ring form (midazolam) and is absorbed as such.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The following chart below plots the percentage of midazolam present as the open-ring form as a function of pH in aqueous solutions. As indicated in the graph, the amount of open-ring compound present in solution is sensitive to changes in pH over the pH range specified for the product: 2.8 to 3.6. Above pH 5, at least 99% of the mixture is present in the closed-ring form.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites, which are similar to those of other benzodiazepines, include sedative, anxiolytic, amnesic and hypnotic activities. Benzodiazepine pharmacologic effects appear to result from reversible interactions with the γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptor in the CNS, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The action of midazolam is readily reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from published reports of studies in pediatric patients clearly demonstrate that oral midazolam provides safe and effective sedation and anxiolysis prior to surgical procedures that require anesthesia as well as before other procedures that require sedation but may not require anesthesia. The most commonly reported effective doses range from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg in children (6 months to &lt;16 years). The single most commonly reported effective dose is 0.5 mg/kg. Time to onset of effect is most frequently reported as 10 to 20 minutes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effects of midazolam on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following premedication with oral midazolam, time to recovery has been assessed in pediatric patients using various measures, such as time to eye opening, time to extubation, time in the recovery room, and time to discharge from the hospital. Most placebo-controlled trials (8 total) have shown little effect of oral midazolam on recovery time from general anesthesia; however, a number of other placebo-controlled studies (5 total) have demonstrated some prolongation in recovery time following premedication with oral midazolam. Prolonged recovery may be related to duration of the surgical procedure and/or use of other medications with central nervous system depressant properties.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Partial or complete impairment of recall following oral midazolam has been demonstrated in several studies. Amnesia for the surgical experience was greater after oral midazolam when used as a premedicant than after placebo and was generally considered a benefit. In one study, 69% of midazolam patients did not remember mask application versus 6% of placebo patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Episodes of oxygen desaturation, respiratory depression, apnea, and airway obstruction have been reported in &lt;1% of pediatric patients following premedication (eg, sedation prior to induction of anesthesia) with midazolam HCl syrup; the potential for such adverse events are markedly increased when oral midazolam is combined with other central nervous system depressing agents and in patients with abnormal airway anatomy, patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, or patients with sepsis or severe pulmonary disease <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_FC7C4F72_40C5_4B31_BA95_7AF27FBA4E25">WARNINGS</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of barbiturates or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation or apnea, and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. In one study of pediatric patients undergoing elective repair of congenital cardiac defects, premedication regimens (oral dose of 0.75 mg/kg midazolam or IM morphine plus scopolamine) increased transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO<sub>2</sub>), decreased SpO<sub>2</sub> (as measured by pulse oximetry), and decreased respiratory rates preferentially in patients with pulmonary hypertension. This suggests that hypercarbia or hypoxia following premedication might pose a risk to children with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension. In a study of an adult population 65 years and older, the preinduction administration of oral midazolam 7.5 mg resulted in a 60% incidence of hypoxemia (paO<sub>2</sub>&lt;90% for over 30 seconds) at some time during the operative procedure versus 15% for the nonpremedicated group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Midazolam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is subject to substantial intestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its major metabolite, α-hydroxymidazolam, and the absolute bioavailability of midazolam HCl syrup were studied in pediatric patients of different ages (6 months to &lt;16 years old) over a 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg dose range. Pharmacokinetic parameters from this study are presented in Table 1. The mean T<sub>max</sub> values across dose groups (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) range from 0.17 to 2.65 hours. Midazolam exhibits linear pharmacokinetics between oral doses of 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 40 mg) across the age groups ranging from 6 months to &lt;16 years. Linearity was also demonstrated across the doses within the age group of 2 years to &lt;12 years having 18 patients at each of the three doses. The absolute bioavailability of the midazolam HCl syrup in pediatric patients is about 36%, which is not affected by pediatric age or weight. The AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> ratio of α-hydroxymidazolam to midazolam for the oral dose in pediatric patients is higher than for an IV dose (0.38 to 0.75 versus 0.21 to 0.39 across the age group of 6 months to &lt;16 years), and the AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> ratio of α-hydroxymidazolam to midazolam for the oral dose is higher in pediatric patients than in adults (0.38 to 0.75 versus 0.40 to 0.56).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Food effect has not been tested using midazolam HCl syrup. When a 15 mg oral tablet of midazolam was administered with food to adults, the absorption and disposition of midazolam was not affected. Feeding is generally contraindicated prior to sedation of pediatric patients for procedures.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The extent of plasma protein binding of midazolam is moderately high and concentration independent. In adults and pediatric patients older than 1 year, midazolam is approximately 97% bound to plasma protein, principally albumin. In healthy volunteers, α-hydroxymidazolam is bound to the extent of 89%. In pediatric patients (6 months to &lt;16 years) receiving 0.15 mg/kg IV midazolam, the mean steady-state volume of distribution ranged from 1.24 to 2.02 L/kg.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut by human cytochrome P450 IIIA4 (CYP3A4) to its pharmacologic active metabolite, α-hydroxymidazolam, followed by glucuronidation of the α-hydroxyl metabolite which is present in unconjugated and conjugated forms in human plasma. The α-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide is then excreted in urine. In a study in which adult volunteers were administered intravenous midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) and α-hydroxymidazolam (0.15 mg/kg), the pharmacodynamic parameter values of the maximum effect (E<sub>max</sub>) and concentration eliciting half-maximal effect (EC<sub>50</sub>) were similar for both compounds. The effects studied were reaction time and errors in tracing tests. The results indicate that α-hydroxymidazolam is equipotent and equally effective as unchanged midazolam on a total plasma concentration basis. After oral or intravenous administration, 63% to 80% of midazolam is recovered in urine as α-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide. No significant amount of parent drug or metabolites is extractable from urine before beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase deconjugation, indicating that the urinary metabolites are excreted mainly as conjugates.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Midazolam is also metabolized to two other minor metabolites: 4-hydroxy metabolite (about 3% of the dose) and 1,4-dihydroxy metabolite (about 1% of the dose) are excreted in small amounts in the urine as conjugates.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mean elimination half-life of midazolam ranged from 2.2 to 6.8 hours following single oral doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg of midazolam HCl syrup. Similar results (ranged from 2.9 to 4.5 hours) for the mean elimination half-life were observed following IV administration of 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam to pediatric patients (6 months to &lt;16 years old). In the same group of patients receiving the 0.15 mg/kg IV dose, the mean total clearance ranged from 9.3 to 11.0 mL/min/kg.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The relationship between plasma concentration and sedation and anxiolysis scores of midazolam HCl syrup (single oral doses of 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) was investigated in three age groups of pediatric patients (6 months to &lt;2 years, 2 to &lt;12 years, and 12 to &lt;16 years old). In this study, the patient’s sedation scores were recorded at baseline and at 10-minute intervals up to 30 minutes after oral dosing until satisfactory sedation (“drowsy” or “asleep but responsive to mild shaking” or “asleep and not responsive to mild shaking”) was achieved. Anxiolysis scores were measured at the time when the patient was separated from his/her parents and at mask induction. The results of the analyses showed that the mean midazolam plasma concentration as well as the mean of midazolam plus α-hydroxymidazolam for those patients with a sedation score of 4 (asleep but responsive to mild shaking) is significantly different than the mean concentrations for those patients with a sedation score of 3 (drowsy), which is significantly different than the mean concentrations for patients with a sedation score of 2 (awake/calm). The statistical analysis indicates that the greater the midazolam, or midazolam plus α-hydroxymidazolam concentration, the greater the maximum sedation score for pediatric patients. No such trend was observed between anxiolysis scores and the mean midazolam concentration or mean of midazolam plus α-hydroxymidazolam concentration, however, anxiolysis is a more variable surrogate measurement of clinical response.</paragraph>

Patients of ASA physical status I, II or III were stratified to 1 of 3 age groups (6 months to &lt;2 years, 2 to &lt;6 years, and 6 to &lt;16 years), and within each age group randomized to 1 of 3 dosing groups (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 20 mg). Greater than 90% of treated patients achieved satisfactory sedation and anxiolysis at least one timepoint within 30 minutes posttreatment. Similarly high proportions of patients exhibited satisfactory ease of separation from parent or guardian and were cooperative at the time of mask induction with nitrous oxide and halothane administration. Onset time of satisfactory sedation or anxiolysis occurred within 10 minutes after treatment for &gt;70% of patients who started with an unsatisfactory baseline rating. Whereas pairwise comparisons (0.25 mg/kg versus 0.5 mg/kg groups, and 0.5 mg/kg versus 1.0 mg/kg groups) on satisfactory sedation did not yield significant p-values (p=0.08 in both cases), comparative analysis of the clinical response between the high and low doses demonstrated that a higher proportion of patients in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group exhibited satisfactory sedation and anxiolysis as compared to the 0.25 mg/kg group (p&lt;0.05).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Midazolam HCl syrup should be used only in hospital or ambulatory care settings, including physicians’ and dentists’ offices, that are equipped to provide continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function. Midazolam HCl syrup must only be administered to patients if they will be monitored by direct visual observation by a health care professional. If midazolam HCl syrup will be administered in combination with other anesthetic drugs or drugs which depress the central nervous system, patients must be monitored by persons specifically trained in the use of these drugs and, in particular, in the management of respiratory effects of these drugs, including respiratory and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For deeply sedated patients, a dedicated individual whose sole responsibility is to observe the patient, other than the practitioner performing the procedure, should monitor the patient throughout the procedure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be continuously monitored for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea with means for detection readily available (eg, pulse oximetry). Hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea can lead to hypoxia and/or cardiac arrest unless effective countermeasures are taken immediately. The immediate availability of specific reversal agents (flumazenil) is highly recommended. Vital signs should continue to be monitored during the recovery period. Because midazolam can depress respiration <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_d83b65e4-2f5d-4502-ac54-6f56a1245eeb">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>]</content>, especially when used concomitantly with opioid agonists and other sedatives <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_950acbb2-5294-41ac-be55-5bba2f6f9df9">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>]</content>, it should be used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia only in the presence of personnel skilled in early detection of hypoventilation, maintaining a patent airway, and supporting ventilation. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Episodes of oxygen desaturation, respiratory depression, apnea, and airway obstruction have been occasionally reported following premedication (sedation prior to induction of anesthesia) with oral midazolam; such events are markedly increased when oral midazolam is combined with other central nervous system depressing agents and in patients with abnormal airway anatomy, patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, or patients with sepsis or severe pulmonary disease.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours.  The clinical significance of these findings in not clear. However, based on the available date, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_37a39fc4-6a39-4548-87ba-7133be5f63c5">PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_37a39fc4-6a39-4548-87ba-7133be5f63c5">Pediatric Use</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_1da0d7a9-6f25-41c6-b938-d1380a2bf9dd">ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects.  These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children and pregnant women needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of midazolam in clinical use are functions of the dose administered, the clinical status of the individual patient, and the use of concomitant medications capable of depressing the CNS. Anticipated effects may range from mild sedation to deep levels of sedation with a potential loss of protective reflexes, particularly when coadministered with anesthetic agents or other CNS depressants. Care must be taken to individualize the dose of midazolam HCl syrup based on the patient’s age, underlying medical/surgical conditions, concomitant medications, and to have the personnel, age- and size-appropriate equipment and facilities available for monitoring and intervention. Practitioners administering midazolam must have the skills necessary to manage reasonably foreseeable adverse effects, particularly skills in airway management.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration.  Benzodiazepines interact at GABA<sub>A</sub> sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors.  When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>One case was reported of inadequate sedation with chloral hydrate and later with oral midazolam due to a possible interaction with methylphenidate administered chronically in a 2-year-old boy with a history of Williams syndrome. The difficulty in achieving adequate sedation may have been the result of decreased absorption of the sedatives due to both the gastrointestinal effects and stimulant effects of methylphenidate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The sedative effect of midazolam HCl syrup is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly opioids (e.g., morphine, meperidine, and fentanyl), propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, secobarbital and droperidol. Consequently, the dose of midazolam HCl syrup should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_950acbb2-5294-41ac-be55-5bba2f6f9df9">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system (ie, some drugs in the drug classes of azole antimycotics, protease inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and macrolide antibiotics). Drugs such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, saquinavir, and verapamil were shown to significantly increase the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC of orally administered midazolam. These drug interactions may result in increased and prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. Although not studied, the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors ritonavir and nelfinavir may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam.

                        <paragraph>Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pregnant rats were treated with midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 1, and 4 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Day 7 through 15). Midazolam did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at doses of up to 1.85 times the human induction dose. All doses produced slight to moderate ataxia. The high dose produced a 5% decrease in maternal body weight gain compared to control.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pregnant rabbits were treated with midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 0.6, and 2 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Day 7 to 18). Midazolam did not cause adverse effects to the fetus at doses of up to 1.85 times the human induction dose. The high dose was associated with findings of ataxia and sedation but no evidence of maternal toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pregnant rats were administered midazolam using intravenous doses of 0.2, 1, and 4 mg/kg/day (0.09, 0.46, and 1.85 times the human induction dose of 0.35 mg/kg based on body surface area comparisons) during late gestation and through lactation (Gestation Day 15 through Lactation Day 21). All doses produced ataxia. The high dose produced a slight decrease in maternal body weight gain compared to control. There were no clear adverse effects noted in the offspring. The study included no functional assessments of the pups, such as learning and memory testing or reproductive capacity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus. In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring. With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear; however, studies in juvenile animals suggest neuroapoptosis correlates with long-term cognitive deficits <content styleCode="italics">[</content>see <content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as Midazolam Hydrochloride Syrup 2 mg/mL, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In primates, exposure to 3 hours of ketamine that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer of isoflurane increased neuronal cell loss. Data from isoflurane-treated rodents and ketamine-treated primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women, neonates, and young children who require procedures with the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data. <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_ee3d9fe8-e2e6-40d8-bf61-76c362db074f">WARNINGS; Pediatric Neurotoxicity</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#ID_cbbbb230-82f0-4217-ad43-ff4ba7f531cd">PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy</linkHtml>, and <linkHtml href="#ID_37a39fc4-6a39-4548-87ba-7133be5f63c5">Pediatric Use</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_1da0d7a9-6f25-41c6-b938-d1380a2bf9dd">ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY</linkHtml>].</content>

One study suggests that hypercarbia or hypoxia following premedication with oral midazolam might pose a risk to children with congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, although there are no known reports of pulmonary hypertensive crisis that had been triggered by premedication. In the study, 22 children were premedicated with oral midazolam (0.75 mg/kg) or IM morphine plus scopolamine prior to elective repair of congenital cardiac defects. Both premedication regimens increased PtcCO<sub>2</sub> and decreased SpO<sub>2</sub> and respiratory rates preferentially in patients with pulmonary hypertension.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The distribution of adverse events occurring in patients evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial are presented in Tables 5 and 6 by body system in order of decreasing frequency: for the premedication period (eg, sedation period prior to induction of anesthesia) alone, see Table 5; for over the entire monitoring period including premedication, anesthesia and recovery, see Table 6.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The distribution of adverse events occurring during the premedication period, before induction of anesthesia, is presented in Table 5. Emesis, which occurred in 31/397 (8%) patients over the entire monitoring period, occurred in 3/397 (0.8%) of patients during the premedication period (from midazolam administration to mask induction). Nausea, which occurred in 14/397 (4%) patients over the entire monitoring period (premedication, anesthesia and recovery), occurred in 2/397 (0.5%) patients during the premedication period.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>This distribution of all adverse events occurring in ≥1% of patients over the entire monitoring period are presented in Table 6. For the entire monitoring period (premedication, anesthesia and recovery), adverse events were reported by 82/397 (21%) patients who received midazolam overall. The most frequently reported adverse events were emesis occurring in 31/397 (8%) patients and nausea occurring in 14/397 (4%) patients. Most of these gastrointestinal events occurred after the administration of other anesthetic agents.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>For the respiratory system overall, adverse events (hypoxia, laryngospasm, rhonchi, coughing, respiratory depression, airway obstruction, upper-airway congestion, shallow respirations), occurred during the entire monitoring period in 31/397 (8%) patients and increased in frequency as dosage was increased: 7/132 (5%) patients in the 0.25 mg/kg dose group, 9/132 (7%) patients in the 0.5 mg/kg dose group, and 15/133 (11%) patients in the 1.0 mg/kg dose group.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Most of the respiratory adverse events occurred during induction, general anesthesia or recovery. One patient (0.25%) experienced a respiratory system adverse event (laryngospasm) during the premedication period. This adverse event occurred precisely at the time of induction. Although many of the respiratory complications occurred in settings of upper airway procedures or concurrently administered opioids, a number of these events occurred outside of these settings as well. In this study, administration of midazolam HCl syrup was generally accompanied by a slight decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, as well as a slight increase in heart rate.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Midazolam HCl syrup is a benzodiazepine and is a Schedule IV controlled substance that can produce drug dependence of the diazepam-type. Therefore, midazolam HCl syrup may be subject to misuse, abuse and addiction. Benzodiazepines can cause physical dependence. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms in patients who abruptly discontinue the drug. Withdrawal symptoms (ie, convulsions, hallucinations, tremors, abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting and sweating), similar in characteristics to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol have occurred following abrupt discontinuation of midazolam following chronic administration. Abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia are prominent symptoms of withdrawal in infants.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The handling of midazolam HCl syrup should be managed to minimize the risk of diversion, including restriction of access and accounting procedures as appropriate to the clinical setting and as required by law.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_8f8fc2da-fecd-4e66-80d0-e6cd104e6331">WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions</linkHtml>]</content>. Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Consider contacting a poison center (1-800-222-1222), poisoncontrol.org, or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations. </paragraph>

                     <title>Monitoring  </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Midazolam HCl syrup should only be used in hospital or ambulatory care settings, including physicians’ and dentists’ offices that can provide for continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function. Immediate availability of resuscitative drugs and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management should be assured <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_FC7C4F72_40C5_4B31_BA95_7AF27FBA4E25">WARNINGS</linkHtml>].</content> For deeply sedated patients, a dedicated individual whose sole responsibility it is to observe the patient, other than the practitioner performing the procedure, should monitor the patient throughout the procedure. Continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function is required.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Midazolam HCl syrup must be given only to patients if they will be monitored by direct visual observation by a health care professional. Midazolam HCl syrup should only be administered by persons specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of respiratory effects of anesthetic drugs, including respiratory and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patient response to sedative agents, and resultant respiratory status, is variable. Regardless of the intended level of sedation or route of administration, sedation is a continuum; a patient may move easily from light to deep sedation, with potential loss of protective reflexes, particularly when coadministered with anesthetic agents, other CNS depressants, and concomitant medications which may potentially cause a more intense and prolonged sedation <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_136B899F_AEBC_42F8_997F_9B723CA3FE4E">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#ID_4C9286F0_00DF_4FFE_A013_BEBCDE83E26D">Drug Interactions</linkHtml>].</content> This is especially true in pediatric patients. The health care practitioner who uses this medication in pediatric patients should be aware of and follow accepted professional guidelines for pediatric sedation appropriate to their situation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sedation guidelines recommend a careful presedation history to determine how a patient’s underlying medical conditions or concomitant medications might affect their response to sedation/analgesia as well as a physical examination including a focused examination of the airway for abnormalities. Further recommendations include appropriate presedation fasting.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Intravenous access is not thought to be necessary for all pediatric patients sedated for a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure because in some cases the difficulty of gaining IV access would defeat the purpose of sedating the child; rather, emphasis should be placed upon having the intravenous equipment available and a practitioner skilled in establishing vascular access in pediatric patients immediately available.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Midazolam HCl syrup must never be used without individualization of dosage, particularly when used with other medications capable of producing CNS depression. Younger (&lt;6 years of age) pediatric patients may require higher dosages (mg/kg) than older pediatric patients, and may require close monitoring.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When midazolam HCl syrup is given in conjunction with opioids or other sedatives, the potential for respiratory depression, airway obstruction, or hypoventilation is increased. For appropriate patient monitoring, <content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#ID_FC7C4F72_40C5_4B31_BA95_7AF27FBA4E25">WARNINGS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_950acbb2-5294-41ac-be55-5bba2f6f9df9">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>: </content>

The health care practitioner who uses this medication in pediatric patients should be aware of and follow accepted professional guidelines for pediatric sedation appropriate to their situation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The recommended dose for pediatric patients is a single dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg, depending on the status of the patient and desired effect, up to a maximum dose of 20 mg. In general, it is recommended that the dose be individualized and modified based on patient age, level of anxiety, concomitant medications, and medical need <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_FC7C4F72_40C5_4B31_BA95_7AF27FBA4E25">WARNINGS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_136B899F_AEBC_42F8_997F_9B723CA3FE4E">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>].</content> The younger (6 months to &lt;6 years of age) and less cooperative patients may require a higher than usual dose up to 1.0 mg/kg. A dose of 0.25 mg/kg may suffice for older (6 to &lt;16 years of age) or cooperative patients, especially if the anticipated intensity and duration of sedation is less critical. For all pediatric patients, a dose of 0.25 mg/kg should be considered when midazolam HCl syrup is administered to patients with cardiac or respiratory compromise, other higher risk surgical patients, and patients who have received concomitant narcotics or other CNS depressants. As with any potential respiratory depressant, these patients must be monitored for signs of cardiorespiratory depression after receiving midazolam HCl syrup. In obese pediatric patients, the dose should be calculated based on ideal body weight. Midazolam HCl syrup has not been studied, nor is it intended for chronic use.</paragraph>

               <title>ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND/OR TOXICOLOGY </title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>Published studies in animals demonstrate that the use of anesthetic agents during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In primates, exposure to 3 hours of exposure to an anesthetic regimen that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer increased neuronal cell loss. Data in rodents and in primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with subtle but prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in neonates and young children who require procedures against the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#ID_ee3d9fe8-e2e6-40d8-bf61-76c362db074f">WARNINGS; Pediatric Neurotoxicity</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="file:///C:\Users\hkamatmhamai\AppData\Local\Temp\1\midazolam-c50000720-01-k01.docx">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>; <linkHtml href="#ID_cbbbb230-82f0-4217-ad43-ff4ba7f531cd">Pregnancy</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_37a39fc4-6a39-4548-87ba-7133be5f63c5">Pediatric Use</linkHtml>].</content>
