                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Metoprolol tartrate is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adult patients, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including metoprolol.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metoprolol tartrate may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.</paragraph>

The effective dosage range of Metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. Measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether   satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose, initiate Metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose of metoprolol and continue for 48 hours. In the case of intolerance, reduce dose to 25 mg and administer for 48 hours. Titrate, based on tolerability, to a maintenance dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of Metoprolol tartrate beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered Metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary ischemia develops, promptly reinstate Metoprolol tartrate, and take measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician’s advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, avoid abruptly discontinuing Metoprolol tartrate in patients treated only for hypertension.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Signs and Symptoms - Overdosage of Metoprolol tartrate may lead to severe bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiogenic shock. Clinical presentation can also include: atrioventricular block, heart failure, bronchospasm, hypoxia, impairment of consciousness/coma, nausea and vomiting.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Treatment – Consider treating the patient with intensive care. Patients with myocardial infarction or heart failure may be prone to significant hemodynamic instability. Beta-blocker overdose may result in significant resistance to resuscitation with adrenergic agents, including beta-agonists. On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, employ the following measures.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Bradycardia: Evaluate the need for atropine, adrenergic-stimulating drugs or pacemaker to treat bradycardia and conduction disorders.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Hypotension: Treat underlying bradycardia. Consider intravenous vasopressor infusion, such as dopamine or norepinephrine.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Heart failure and shock: May be treated when appropriate with suitable volume expansion, injection of glucagon (if necessary, followed by an intravenous infusion of glucagon), intravenous administration of adrenergic drugs such as dobutamine, with α     <sub>1</sub>receptor agonistic drugs added in presence of vasodilation.   </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Metoprolol is a beta     <sub>1</sub>-selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent. This preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta     <sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at plasma concentrations much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The relative beta     <sub>1</sub>-selectivity of metoprolol has been confirmed by the following: (1) In normal subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta     <sub>2</sub>-mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective beta-blockers, which completely reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV     <sub>1</sub>and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta     <sub>1</sub>-receptor blocking doses.   </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Hypertension:</content>The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents has not been elucidated. However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin activity.   </paragraph>

                     <title>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinical pharmacology studies have confirmed the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol in man, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The relationship between plasma metoprolol levels and reduction in exercise heart rate is independent of the pharmaceutical formulation. Beta     <sub>1</sub>-blocking effects in the range of 30-80% of the maximal effect (approximately 8 to 23% reduction in exercise heart rate) correspond to metoprolol plasma concentrations from 30 to 540 nmol/L. The relative beta     <sub>1</sub>-selectivity of metoprolol diminishes and blockade of beta     <sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors increases at plasma concentration above 300 nmol/L.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Significant beta-blocking effect (as measured by reduction of exercise heart rate) occurs within 1 hour after oral administration, and its duration is dose-related. For example, a 50% reduction of the maximum effect after single oral doses of 20, 50, and 100 mg occurred at 3.3, 5.0, and 6.4 hours, respectively, in normal subjects. After repeated oral dosages of 100 mg twice daily, a significant reduction in exercise systolic blood pressure was evident at 12 hours. When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta-blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. Equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is achieved with oral and intravenous doses in the ratio of approximately 2.5:1.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate. However, antihypertensive activity does not appear to be related to plasma levels. Because of variable plasma levels attained with a given dose and lack of a consistent relationship of antihypertensive activity to dose, selection of proper dosage requires individual titration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In several studies of patients with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous followed by oral administration of Metoprolol tartrate caused a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output. Stroke volume, diastolic blood pressure and pulmonary artery end diastolic pressure remained unchanged.</paragraph>

In poor metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of metoprolol tartrate. In 2-year studies in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg/day (19 times, on a mg/m     <sup>2</sup>basis, the daily dose of 400 mg for a 60-kg patient), there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg/day (9 times, on a mg/m     <sup>2</sup>basis, the daily dose of 400 mg for a 60-kg patient), benign lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, nor in the overall incidence of tumors or malignant tumors. This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type of tumor.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All genotoxicity tests performed on metoprolol tartrate (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in somatic cells, a     <content styleCode="italics">Salmonella</content>/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) and metoprolol succinate (a     <content styleCode="italics">Salmonella</content>/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test) were negative.   </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No evidence of impaired fertility due to metoprolol tartrate was observed in a study performed in rats at doses up to 55.5 times, on a mg/m     <sup>2</sup>basis, the daily dose of 450 mg in a 60-kg patient.   </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials, Metoprolol tartrate, administered two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks and increasing exercise tolerance.

A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that Metoprolol tartrate was indistinguishable from propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.3 Myocardial Infarction</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In a large (1395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, Metoprolol tartrate was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of Metoprolol tartrate or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with Metoprolol tartrate or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given Metoprolol tartrate and followed up to 1 year.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the Metoprolol tartrate - and placebo-treatment groups. Among patients treated with Metoprolol tartrate, there were comparable reductions in 3- month mortality for those treated early (≤ 8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with Metoprolol tartrate and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intra-venously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no beta-blocker treatment for this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the benefit of later beta-blocker therapy. Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta-blockers.</paragraph>
