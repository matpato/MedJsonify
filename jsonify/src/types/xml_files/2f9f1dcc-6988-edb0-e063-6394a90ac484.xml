                     <content styleCode="italics">Mechanism of Action</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Timolol maleate is a beta
 
  <sub>1</sub>and beta
 
  <sub>2</sub>(non-selective) adrenergic receptor blocking agent that does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade reduces cardiac output in both healthy subjects and patients with heart disease. In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may inhibit the stimulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the bronchi and bronchioles results in increased airway resistance from unopposed parasympathetic activity. Such an effect in patients with asthma or other bronchospastic conditions is potentially dangerous.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution, when applied topically on the eye, has the action of reducing elevated as well as normal intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of intraocular pressure, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The onset of reduction in intraocular pressure following administration of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution can usually be detected within one-half hour after a single dose. The maximum effect usually occurs in one to two hours, and significant lowering of intraocular pressure can be maintained for periods as long as 24 hours with a single dose. Repeated observations over a period of one year indicate that the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is well maintained.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The precise mechanism of the ocular hypotensive action of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is not clearly established at this time. Tonography and fluorophotometry studies in man suggest that its predominant action may be related to reduced aqueous formation. However, in some studies a slight increase in outflow facility was also observed.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="italics">Pharmacokinetics</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a study of plasma drug concentration in six subjects, the systemic exposure to timolol was determined following twice daily administration of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5%. The mean peak plasma concentration following morning dosing was 0.46 ng/mL and following afternoon dosing was 0.35Â ng/mL.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="italics">Clinical Studies</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In controlled multiclinic studies in patients with untreated intraocular pressures of 22 mmHg or greater, Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.25 or 0.5% administered twice a day produced a greater reduction in intraocular pressure than 1, 2, 3, or 4% pilocarpine solution administered four times a day or 0.5, 1, or 2% epinephrine hydrochloride solution administered twice a day.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In these studies, Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution was generally well tolerated and produced fewer and less severe side effects than either pilocarpine or epinephrine. A slight reduction of resting heart rate in some patients receiving Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution (mean reduction 2.9 beats/minute standard deviation 10.2) was observed.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have experienced protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, some authorities recommend gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of adrenergic agonists.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a two-year study of timolol maleate administered orally to rats, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas in male rats administered 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 42,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). Similar differences were not observed in rats administered oral doses equivalent to approximately 14,000 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a lifetime oral study in mice, there were statistically significant increases in the incidence of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps and mammary adenocarcinomas in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day (approximately 71,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose), but not at 5 or 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 700 or 7,000 times, respectively, the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). In a subsequent study in female mice, in which post-mortem examinations were limited to the uterus and the lungs, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pulmonary tumors was again observed at 500 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The increased occurrence of mammary adenocarcinomas was associated with elevations in serum prolactin which occurred in female mice administered oral timolol at 500 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 5 or 50 mg/kg/day. An increased incidence of mammary adenocarcinomas in rodents has been associated with administration of several other therapeutic agents that elevate serum prolactin, but no correlation between serum prolactin levels and mammary tumors has been established in humans. Furthermore, in adult human female subjects who received oral dosages of up to 60 mg of timolol maleate (the maximum recommended human oral dosage), there were no clinically meaningful changes in serum prolactin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Timolol maleate was devoid of mutagenic potential when tested in vivo (mouse) in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay (doses up to 800 mg/kg) and in vitro in a neoplastic cell transformation assay (up to 100 mcg/mL). In Ames tests, the highest concentrations of timolol employed, 5,000 or 10,000 mcg/plate, were associated with statistically significant elevations of revertants observed with tester strain TA100 (in seven replicate assays), but not in the remaining three strains. In the assays with tester strain TA100, no consistent dose response relationship was observed, and the ratio of test to control revertants did not reach 2. A ratio of 2 is usually considered the criterion for a positive Ames test.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Teratogenicity studies with timolol in mice, rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (7,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose) demonstrated no evidence of fetal malformations. Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day (142,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses of 14,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose, in this case without apparent maternotoxicity.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>There have been reports of inadvertent overdosage with Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution resulting in systemic effects similar to those seen with systemic beta-adrenergic blocking agents such as dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, bradycardia, bronchospasm, and cardiac arrest (see

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Overdosage has been reported with timolol maleate tablets. A 30-year-old female ingested 650 mg of timolol maleate tablets (maximum recommended oral daily dose is 60 mg) and experienced second and third degree heart block. She recovered without treatment but approximately two months later developed irregular heartbeat, hypertension, dizziness, tinnitus, faintness, increased pulse rate, and borderline first degree heart block.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>An in vitro hemodialysis study, using
 
  <sup>14</sup>C timolol added to human plasma or whole blood, showed that timolol was readily dialyzed from these fluids; however, a study of patients with renal failure showed that timolol did not dialyze readily.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Preservative-free Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution in OCUDOSE is a sterile solution that does not contain a preservative. The solution from one individual unit is to be used immediately after opening for administration to one or both eyes. Since sterility cannot be guaranteed after the individual unit is opened, the remaining contents should be discarded immediately after administration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Preservative-free Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution in OCUDOSE is available in concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5%. The usual starting dose is one drop of 0.25% Preservative-free Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution in OCUDOSE in the affected eye(s) administered twice a day. Apply enough gentle pressure on the individual container to obtain a single drop of solution. If the clinical response is not adequate, the dosage may be changed to one drop of 0.5%Â solution in the affected eye(s) administered twice a day.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Since in some patients the pressure-lowering response to Preservative-free Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution in OCUDOSE may require a few weeks to stabilize, evaluation should include a determination of intraocular pressure after approximately 4 weeks of treatment with Preservative-free Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution in OCUDOSE.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If the intraocular pressure is maintained at satisfactory levels, the dosage schedule may be changed to one drop once a day in the affected eye(s). Because of diurnal variations in intraocular pressure, satisfactory response to the once-a-day dose is best determined by measuring the intraocular pressure at different times during the day.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Dosages above one drop of 0.5% Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution twice a day generally have not been shown to produce further reduction in intraocular pressure. If the patientâs intraocular pressure is still not at a satisfactory level on this regimen, concomitant therapy with other agent(s) for lowering intraocular pressure can be instituted taking into consideration that the preparation(s) used concomitantly may contain one or more preservatives. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended (see
