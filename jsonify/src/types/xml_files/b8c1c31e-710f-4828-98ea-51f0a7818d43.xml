Tydemy should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. Tydemy can be taken without regard to meals. If Tydemy is first taken later than the first day of the menstrual cycle, Tydemy should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days.

She should begin taking her orange tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last light orange folate tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress. Anytime a subsequent cycle of Tydemy is started later than the day following administration of the last light orange tablet, the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken an orange Tydemy daily for seven consecutive days. </paragraph>

When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, Tydemy should be started on the day of removal. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last orange tablet. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking Tydemy, instruct the patient to continue taking Tydemy by the regimen described above. Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, she should consult her healthcare provider. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if Tydemy is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue Tydemy if pregnancy is confirmed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of pregnancy increases with each active orange tablet missed. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more light orange tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of orange tablets on the proper day. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start Tydemy no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts Tydemy postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken Tydemy for 7 consecutive days. </paragraph>

Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin<sup>®</sup>), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE.

                        <paragraph ID="ID43">In addition to these "regulatory studies," other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 2): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 2), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC. </paragraph>

To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective: If 10,000 women who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year, between 1 and 5 of these women will develop a VTE.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID49">Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets is contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency). Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin–II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID136">12.3</linkHtml>)].</content>

Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID34">4</linkHtml>)].</content>

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (&lt;6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#ID85">6.2</linkHtml>)].</content> <br/>

Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. <br/>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID65">Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from ten Yasmin<sup>®</sup> contraceptive efficacy clinical trials (N=2,467) show that the percent of women who took Yasmin<sup>®</sup> and experienced unscheduled bleeding decreased over time from 12% at cycle 2 to 6% (cycle 13). A total of 25 subjects out of 3,009 in the Yasmin<sup>®</sup> and drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets trials (&lt;1%) discontinued due to bleeding complaints. These are described as metrorrhagia, vaginal hemorrhage, menorrhagia, abnormal withdrawal bleeding, and menometrorrhagia. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The average duration of scheduled bleeding episodes in the majority of subjects (86% to 88%) was 4 to 7 days. Women who use drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from Yasmin<sup>®</sup> contraceptive efficacy trials, during cycles 2 to 13, 1 to 11% of women per cycle experienced no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>An open-label study evaluated the degree of DRSP transfer into milk within 72 hours following a single oral administration of 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE tablets to 6 healthy lactating women who were 1 week to 3 months post- partum. DRSP was present in breast milk with a mean Cmax of 13.5 ng/mL, while the mean Cmax in serum of lactating women was 30.8 ng/mL. The DRSP concentration in breast milk over the 24-hour period following dosing ranged from 1.4 to 7.0 ng/mL, with a mean ± standard deviation value of 3.7 ± 1.9 ng/mL. Based on single dose data, the maximal daily infant dose of DRSP was calculated to be 0.003 mg/day, which represented a mean of 0.1% of the maternal dose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A study in approximately 60 lactating women demonstrated no significant differences in folate concentrations in milk between women who received 416 mcg/day [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 400 mcg/day folic acid and women who received placebo over a 16-week period. Studies to date indicate there is no adverse effect of folate on nursing infants. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism. The absolute bioavailability of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets, which is a combination tablet of DRSP and EE has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1 to 2 hours after administration of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg. Following daily dosing of Yasmin<sup>®</sup>, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C<sub>max</sub> and AUC <sub>(0 to 24h)</sub> values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of Yasmin<sup>®</sup> (see Table 3). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of Yasmin<sup>®</sup> serum C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>(0 to 24h)</sub> values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 3). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Levomefolate calcium is structurally identical to L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-methyl-THF), a metabolite of vitamin B<sub>9</sub>. Mean baseline concentrations of about 15 nmol/L are reached in populations without folate food fortification under normal nutritional conditions. Orally administered levomefolate calcium is absorbed and is incorporated into the body folate pool. Peak plasma concentrations of about 50 nmol/L above baseline are reached within 0.5 to </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The rate of absorption of DRSP and EE following single administration of a formulation similar to drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets was slower under fed (high fat meal) conditions with the serum C<sub>max</sub> being reduced about 40% for both components. The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effect of food on absorption of levomefolate calcium following administration of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets has not been evaluated. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4 to 5 L/kg. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DRSP does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Biphasic kinetics is reported for folates with a fast- and a slow-turnover pool. The fast-turnover pool, probably reflecting newly absorbed folate, is consistent with the terminal half-life of approximately 4 to 5 hours after single oral administration of 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium. The slow-turnover pool reflecting turnover of folate polyglutamate has a mean residence time of greater than or equal to 100 days. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The two main metabolites of DRSP found in human plasma were identified to be the acid form of DRSP generated by opening of the lactone ring and the 4,5-dihydrodrospirenone-3-sulfate, formed by reduction and subsequent sulfatation. These metabolites were shown not to be pharmacologically active. Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>L-5-methyl-THF is the predominant folate transport form in blood under physiological conditions and during folic acid and levomefolate calcium administration. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38 to 47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17 to 20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>L-5-methyl-THF is eliminated from the body by urinary excretion of intact folates and catabolic products as well as fecal excretion through a biphasic kinetics process. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30 to 65). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50 to 79 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr ≥ 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30 to 49 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium-sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID34">4</linkHtml>) and Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID48">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>

In <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found. These results demonstrate that DRSP did not inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content>. </paragraph>

The results of these studies demonstrated that pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A4 substrates were not influenced by steady state DRSP concentrations achieved after administration of 3 mg DRSP/day. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tydemy is a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, a synthetic estrogen called ethinyl estradiol and a progestin called drospirenone. Tydemy also contains levomefolate calcium, which is a B vitamin. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The progestin drospirenone may increase potassium. Therefore, you should not take Tydemy if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because this could cause serious heart and health problems. Other drugs may also increase potassium. If you are currently on daily, long-term treatment for a chronic condition with any of the medications below, you should consult your healthcare provider about whether Tydemy is right for you, and during the first month that you take Tydemy, you should have a blood test to check your potassium level. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID173">Tydemy may also be taken by women who elect to use an oral contraceptive, to provide folate supplementation. It is recommended that women of reproductive age supplement their diet with 0.4 mg (400 mcg) of folic acid daily to lower their risk of having a pregnancy with a rare type of birth defect (known as a neural tube defect). The amount of folate contained in Tydemy supplements folate in the diet to lower this risk should you become pregnant while taking the drug or shortly after stopping it. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>2. The right way to take the pill is to take one pill every day at the same time in the order directed on the package. Preferably, take the pill after the evening meal or at bedtime, with some liquid, as needed. Tydemy can be taken without regard to meals. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS" below. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>If you do have spotting or light bleeding or feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it does not go away, check with your healthcare provider. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>4. Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you make up these missed pills. On the days you take two pills, to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>5. If you have vomiting (within 3 to 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for "WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS." If you have diarrhea or if you take certain medicines, including some antibiotics and some herbal products such as St. John's wort, your pills may not work as well. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use a back-up method (such as condoms and spermicides) until you check with your healthcare provider. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Like pregnancy, birth control pills increase the risk of serious blood clots (see following graph), especially in women who have other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or age greater than 35. This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more. Women who use birth control pills with drospirenone (like Tydemy) may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot. Some studies reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use birth control pills that contain drospirenone than for women who use birth control pills that do not contain drospirenone. </paragraph>

Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider. </paragraph>

It is important that your healthcare provider checks you to find out if you are pregnant. Stop taking Tydemy if you are pregnant. </paragraph>
