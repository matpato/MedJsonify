                  <paragraph>Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone), which also have salt-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states.  Their synthetic analogs are primarily used for their potent anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prednisolone is a synthetic adrenocortical steroid drug with predominantly glucocorticoid properties. Some of these properties reproduce the physiological actions of endogenous glucocorticosteroids, but others do not necessarily reflect any of the adrenal hormones’ normal functions; they are seen only after administration of large therapeutic doses of the drug.  The pharmacological effects of prednisolone which are due to its glucocorticoid properties include: promotion of gluconeogenesis; increased deposition of glycogen in the liver; inhibition of the  utilization of glucose; anti-insulin activity; increased catabolism of protein; increased lipolysis; stimulation of fat synthesis and storage; increased glomerular filtration rate and resulting increase in urinary excretion of urate (creatinine excretion remains unchanged); and increased calcium excretion.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Depressed production of eosinophils and lymphocytes occurs, but erythropoiesis and production of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are stimulated.  Inflammatory processes (edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilatation, migration of leukocytes and phagocytosis) and the later stages of wound healing (capillary proliferation, deposition of collagen, cicatrization) are inhibited.  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prednisolone can stimulate secretion of various components of gastric juice.  Suppression of the production of corticotropin may lead to suppression of endogenous corticosteroids.  Prednisolone has slight mineralocorticoid activity, whereby entry of sodium into cells and loss of intracellular potassium is stimulated.  This is particularly evident in the kidney, where rapid ion exchange leads to sodium retention and hypertension.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prednisolone is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration.  Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) produces a 14% higher peak plasma level of prednisolone which occurs 20% faster than that seen with tablets.  Prednisolone is 70-90% protein bound in the plasma, and it is eliminated from the plasma with a half-life of 2 to 4 hours.  It is metabolized mainly in the liver and excreted in the urine as sulfate and glucuronide conjugates.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The systemic availability, metabolism and elimination of prednisolone after administration of single weight-based doses (0.8 mg/ kg) of intravenous (IV) prednisolone and oral prednisone were reported in a small study of 19 young (23 to 34 years) and 12 elderly (65 to 89 years) subjects.  Results showed that the systemic availability of total and unbound prednisolone, as well as interconversion between prednisolone and prednisone were independent of age.  The mean unbound fraction of prednisolone was higher, and the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of unbound prednisolone was reduced in elderly patients.  Plasma prednisolone concentrations were higher in elderly subjects, and the higher AUCs of total and unbound prednisolone were most likely reflective of an impaired metabolic clearance, evidenced by reduced fractional urinary clearance of 6β-hydroxyprednisolone.  Despite these findings of higher total and unbound prednisolone concentrations, elderly subjects had higher AUCs of cortisol, suggesting that the elderly population is less sensitive to suppression of endogenous cortisol or their capacity for hepatic inactivation of cortisol is diminished.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Drugs such as barbiturates, phenytoin, ephedrine, and rifampin, which induce hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme activity may enhance metabolism of prednisolone and require that the dosage of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) be increased.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Increased activity of both cyclosporin and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently.  Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids thereby increasing their effect.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60% leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Coadministration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports.  Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of aspirin (or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.  Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia.  The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (i.e., diuretics, amphotericin-B), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia.  Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis.  If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Due to inhibition of antibody response, patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines.  Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines.  If possible, routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of prednisolone in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (&gt;2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (&gt;1 month of age). However, some of these conclusions and other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroid, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The adverse effects of prednisolone in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see
<linkHtml href="#LINK_9a439fd7-fdfa-4b57-a045-4c4609d38d70">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Children who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in children than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of children treated with corticosteroids by any route should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of other treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, children should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies of prednisolone sodium phosphate oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience with prednisolone sodium phosphate has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the incidence of corticosteroid-induced side effects may be increased in geriatric patients and appear to be dose-related. Osteoporosis is the most frequently encountered complication, which occurs at a higher incidence rate in corticosteroid-treated geriatric patients as compared to younger populations and in age-matched controls. Losses of bone mineral density appear to be greatest early on in the course of treatment and may recover over time after steroid withdrawal or use of lower doses (i.e., ≤5 mg/day). Prednisolone doses of 7.5 mg/day or higher have been associated with an increased relative risk of both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, even in the presence of higher bone density compared to patients with involutional osteoporosis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Routine screening of geriatric patients, including regular assessments of bone mineral density and institution of fracture prevention strategies, along with regular review of prednisolone indication should be undertaken to minimize complications and keep the prednisolone dose at the lowest acceptable level. Co-administration of bisphosphonates has been shown to retard the rate of bone loss in corticosteroid-treated males and post-menopausal females, and these agents are recommended in the prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It has been reported that equivalent weight-based doses yield higher total and unbound prednisolone plasma concentrations and reduced renal and non-renal clearance in elderly patients compared to younger populations. However, it is not clear whether dosing reductions would be necessary in elderly patients, since these pharmacokinetic alterations may be offset by age-related differences in responsiveness of target organs and/or less pronounced suppression of adrenal release of cortisol. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see

                  <paragraph>The effects of accidental ingestion of large quantities of prednisolone over a very short period of time have not been reported, but prolonged use of the drug can produce mental symptoms, moon face, abnormal fat deposits, fluid retention, excessive appetite, weight gain, hypertrichosis, acne, striae, ecchymosis, increased sweating, pigmentation, dry scaly skin, thinning scalp hair, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, thrombophlebitis, decreased resistance to infection, negative nitrogen balance with delayed bone and wound healing, headache, weakness, menstrual disorders, accentuated menopausal symptoms, neuropathy, fractures, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, decreased glucose tolerance, hypokalemia, and adrenal insufficiency. Hepatomegaly and abdominal distention have been observed in children.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Treatment of acute overdosage is by immediate gastric lavage or emesis followed by supportive and symptomatic therapy. For chronic overdosage in the face of severe disease requiring continuous steroid therapy the dosage of prednisolone may be reduced only temporarily, or alternate day treatment may be introduced. </paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The initial dosage of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) may vary from 2.5 mL to 30 mL (5 to 60 mg prednisolone base) per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated.  In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required.  The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted.  If after a reasonable period of time, there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) should be discontinued and the patient placed on other appropriate therapy. <content styleCode="bold"> IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.</content>  After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached.  It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition.  If after long term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In pediatric patients, the initial dose of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated.  The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m
<sup>2</sup>bsa/day).  The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m
<sup>2</sup>/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m
<sup>2</sup>/day.
</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic
<content styleCode="italics">prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone </content>in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1-2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses.  It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve.  This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer.  There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.
