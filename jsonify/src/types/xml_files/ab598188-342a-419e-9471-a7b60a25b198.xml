                        <paragraph>Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% is a concentrated solution and must be diluted before intravenous administration via a central venous catheter.  Administration through a peripheral intravenous catheter may cause burns. Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% may not be administered by any other route.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% should be administered as a loading dose infusion over 90 to 120 minutes, followed by the same dose repeated as a maintenance infusion administered over 24 hours. Because of prolonged plasma levels achieved by phenylacetate in pharmacokinetic studies, repeat loading doses of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% should not be administered. Maintenance infusions may be continued until elevated plasma ammonia levels have been normalized or the patient can tolerate oral nutrition and medications. An antiemetic may be administered during Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% infusion to aid control of infusion-associated nausea and vomiting. Administration of analogous oral drugs, such as sodium phenylbutyrate, should be terminated prior to Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% infusion.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% infusion should be started as soon as the diagnosis of hyperammonemia is made. Treatment of hyperammonemia also requires caloric supplementation and restriction of dietary protein. Non-protein calories should be supplied principally as glucose (8–10 mg/kg/min) with an intravenous fat emulsion added. Attempts should be made to maintain a caloric intake of greater than 80 kcal/kg/day. During and after infusion of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%, ongoing monitoring of the following clinical laboratory values is crucial: plasma ammonia, glutamine, quantitative plasma amino acids, blood glucose, electrolytes, venous or arterial blood gases, AST and ALT. On-going monitoring of the following clinical responses is also crucial to assess patient response to treatment: neurological status, Glasgow Coma Scale, tachypnea, CT or MRI scan or fundoscopic evidence of cerebral edema, and/or of gray matter and white matter damage. Hemodialysis should be considered in patients with severe hyperammonemia or who are not responsive to Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% administration [see <content styleCode="italics">

                           </content>]. In the non-neonatal study patient population treated with Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%, dialysis was required in 13% of hyperammonemic episodes. Standard hemodialysis was the most frequently used dialysis method. High levels of ammonia can be reduced quickly when Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% is used with hemodialysis, as the ammonia-scavenging of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% suppresses the production of ammonia from catabolism of endogenous protein and hemodialysis eliminates the ammonia and ammonia conjugates.</paragraph>

Because hyperchloremic acidosis may develop after high-dose arginine hydrochloride administration, chloride and bicarbonate levels should be monitored and appropriate amounts of bicarbonate administered.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In hyperammonemic infants with suspected, but unconfirmed urea cycle disorders, intravenous arginine should be given (6 mL/kg of Arginine HCl Injection 10%, over 90 minutes followed by the same dose given as a maintenance infusion over 24 hours). If deficiencies of ASS or ASL are excluded as diagnostic possibilities, the intravenous dose of Arginine HCl should be reduced to 2 mL/kg/day Arginine HCl Injection 10%.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Any episode of acute symptomatic hyperammonemia should be treated as a life-threatening emergency. Uncontrolled hyperammonemia can rapidly result in brain damage or death, and prompt use of all therapies necessary, including hemodialysis, to reduce ammonia levels is essential.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hyperammonemic coma (regardless of cause) in the newborn infant should be aggressively treated while the specific diagnosis is pursued. Hemodialysis should be promptly initiated in all newborn patients. A blood flow rate of 150 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup> should be targeted (ammonia clearance [mL/min] is similar to the blood flow rate [mL/min] through the dialyzer).  Clearance of ammonia is approximately ten times greater by hemodialysis than by peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration. Exchange transfusion is ineffective in the management of hyperammonemia.  Hemodialysis may be repeated until the plasma ammonia level is stable at normal or near normal levels.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hyperammonemia due to urea cycle disorders should be managed in coordination with medical personnel experienced in metabolic disorders. Ongoing monitoring of plasma ammonia levels, neurological status, laboratory tests, and clinical response in patients receiving Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% is crucial to assess patient response to treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety data were obtained from 316 patients who received Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% as emergency (rescue) or prospective treatment for hyperammonemia as part of an uncontrolled, open-label study. The study population included patients between the ages of 0 to 53 years with a mean (SD) of 6.2 (8.54) years; 51% were male and 49% were female who had the following diagnoses:  OTC (46%), ASS (22%), CPS (12%), ASL (2%), ARG (&lt;1%), THN (&lt;1%), and other (18%). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in patients with OTC, ASS, CPS, and diagnoses categorized as "other." Nervous system disorders were more frequent in patients with OTC and CPS, compared with patients with ASS and patients with "other" diagnoses. Convulsions and mental impairment were reported in patients with OTC and CPS. These observations are consistent with literature reports that patients with enzyme deficiencies occurring earlier in the urea cycle (i.e., OTC and CPS) tend to be more severely affected.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Some antibiotics such as penicillin may compete with phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate for active secretion by renal tubules, which may affect the overall disposition of the infused drug.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Probenecid is known to inhibit the renal transport of many organic compounds, including aminohippuric acid, and may affect renal excretion of phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There have been reports that valproic acid can induce hyperammonemia through inhibition of the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate, a co-factor for carbamyl phosphate synthetase. Therefore, administration of valproic acid to patients with urea cycle disorders may exacerbate their condition and antagonize the efficacy of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%.</paragraph>

All patients in the uncontrolled open-label study were to be treated with the same dose of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%. However, some patients received more than the dose level specified in the protocol.  In 16 of the 64 deaths, the patient received a known overdose of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%. Causes of death in these patients included cardiorespiratory failure/arrest (6 patients), hyperammonemia (3 patients), increased intracranial pressure (2 patients), pneumonitis with septic shock and coagulopathy (1 patient), error in dialysis procedure (1 patient), respiratory failure (1 patient), intractable hypotension and probable sepsis (1 patient), and unknown (1 patient). Additionally, other signs of intoxication may include obtundation (in the absence of hyperammonemia), hyperventilation, a severe compensated metabolic acidosis, perhaps with a respiratory component, large anion gap, hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity, progressive encephalopathy, cardiovascular collapse, and death.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In case of overdose of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate emergency medical monitoring and procedures.

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Urea cycle disorders can result from decreased activity of any of the following enzymes: <content styleCode="italics">N</content>-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS), carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS), argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), or arginase (ARG).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate are metabolically active compounds that can serve as alternatives to urea for the excretion of waste nitrogen. Figure 2 is a schematic illustrating how the components of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%, phenylacetate and benzoate, provide an alternative pathway for nitrogen disposal in patients without a fully functioning urea cycle. Phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine in the liver and kidneys to form phenylacetylglutamine, via acetylation. Phenylacetylglutamine is excreted by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. The nitrogen content of phenylacetylglutamine per mole is identical to that of urea (both contain two moles of nitrogen). Two moles of nitrogen are removed per mole of phenylacetate when it is conjugated with glutamine. Similarly, preceded by acylation, benzoate conjugates with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. One mole of hippuric acid contains one mole of waste nitrogen. Thus, one mole of nitrogen is removed per mole of benzoate when it is conjugated with glycine. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% was characterized in healthy adult volunteers. Both benzoate and phenylacetate exhibited nonlinear kinetics. Following 90 minute intravenous infusion mean AUC<sub>last</sub> for benzoate was 20.3, 114.9, 564.6, 562.8, and 1599.1 mcg/mL following doses of 1, 2, 3.75, 4, and 5.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The total clearance decreased from 5.19 to 3.62 L/h/m<sup>2</sup> at the 3.75 and 5.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> doses, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Similarly, phenylacetate exhibited nonlinear kinetics following the priming dose regimens.  AUC<sub>last</sub> was 175.6, 713.8, 2040.6, 2181.6, and 3829.2 mcg∙h/mL following doses of 1, 2, 3.75, 4, and 5.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.  The total clearance decreased from 1.82 to 0.89 mcg∙h/mL with increasing dose (3.75 and 4 g/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the sequence of 90 minute priming infusion followed by a 24 hour maintenance infusion, phenylacetate was detected in the plasma at the end of infusion (T<sub>max</sub> of 2 hr at 3.75 g/m<sup>2</sup>) whereas, benzoate concentrations declined rapidly (T<sub>max</sub> of 1.5 hr at 3.75 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and were undetectable at 14 and 26 hours following the 3.75 and 4 g/m<sup>2</sup> dose, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A difference in the metabolic rates for phenylacetate and benzoate was noted.  The formation of hippurate from benzoate occurred more rapidly than that of phenylacetylglutamine from phenylacetate, and the rate of elimination for hippurate appeared to be more rapid than that for phenylacetylglutamine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pharmacokinetic observations have also been reported from twelve episodes of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in seven children diagnosed (age 3 to 26 months) with urea cycle disorders who had been administered Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% intravenously. These data showed peak plasma levels of phenylacetate and benzoate at approximately the same times as were observed in healthy adults.  As in healthy adults, the plasma levels of phenylacetate were higher than benzoate and were present for a longer time.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of intravenous phenylacetate have been reported following administration to adult patients with advanced solid tumors. The decline in serum phenylacetate concentrations following a loading infusion of 150 mg/kg was consistent with saturable enzyme kinetics. Ninety-nine percent of administered phenylacetate was excreted as phenylacetylglutamine [2,3].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In animal studies, subcutaneous administration to rat pups of 190–474 mg/kg of phenylacetate caused decreased proliferation and increased loss of neurons, and reduced central nervous system (CNS) myelin. Cerebral synapse maturation was retarded, and the number of functioning nerve terminals in the cerebrum was reduced, which resulted in impaired brain growth.  Pregnant rats were given phenylacetate at 3.5 µmol/g/day subcutaneously from gestation day 7 through normal delivery. Prenatal exposure of rat pups to phenylacetate produced lesions in layer 5 cortical pyramidal cells; dendritic spines were longer and thinner than normal and reduced in number.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>On admission to the hospital, patients with hyperammonemia and a suspected or confirmed urea cycle disorder (UCD) diagnosis were treated with a bolus dose of 0.25 g/kg (or 5.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>) sodium phenylacetate + 0.25 g/kg (or 5.5 g/m<sup>2</sup>) sodium benzoate over a period of 90 minutes to 6 hours, depending on the specific UCD. Infusions also contained arginine; the dose of arginine depended on the specific UCD. After completion of the bolus dose, maintenance infusions of the same dose over 24 hours were continued until the patient was no longer hyperammonemic or oral therapy could be tolerated. The mean (SD) duration of treatment was 4.6 (6.45) days per episode, and ranged from 1 to 72 days.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Survival was substantially improved after Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% treatment compared with historical values (estimated 14% 1-year survival rate with dietary therapy alone) and with dialysis (estimated 43% survival of acute hyperammonemia) . </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Eighty percent of patients (252 of 316) survived their last episode. Of the 64 patients who died, 53 (83%) died during their first hyperammonemic episode. Of the 104 neonates (&lt;30d) treated with Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%, 34 (33%) died during the first hyperammonemic episode.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ammonia levels decreased from very high levels (&gt;4 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) to lower levels in 91% of episodes after treatment. In patients responding to therapy, mean ammonia concentrations decreased from 200.9 µmol/L at hour zero to 101.6 µmol/L within four hours of initiation of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10% therapy and were maintained. Hemodialysis is recommended for those patients whose plasma ammonia levels fail to fall below 150 µmol/L or by more than 40% within 4 to 8 hours after receiving Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, 10%/10%. A shift from high (≤4 times ULN) to very high (&gt;4 times ULN) levels was observed in only 4% of the episodes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Overall, investigators rated neurological status as improved, much improved, or the same in 93% of episodes, and overall status in response to treatment as improved, much improved, or the same in 97% of episodes. Recovery from coma was observed in 97% of episodes where coma was present at admission (111 of 114 episodes).</paragraph>
