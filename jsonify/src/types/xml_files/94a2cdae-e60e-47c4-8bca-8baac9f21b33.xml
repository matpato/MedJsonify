Cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED and Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) are not bioequivalent and cannot be used interchangeably without physician supervision. For a given trough concentration, cyclosporine exposure will be greater with cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED than with Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP). If a patient who is receiving exceptionally high doses of Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) is converted to cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED, particular caution should be exercised. Cyclosporine blood concentrations should be monitored in transplant and rheumatoid arthritis patients taking cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED to avoid toxicity due to high concentrations. Dose adjustments should be made in transplant patients to minimize possible organ rejection due to low concentrations. Comparison of blood concentrations in the published literature with blood concentrations obtained using current assays must be done with detailed knowledge of the assay methods employed <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_49f7da83-ca84-4370-bc36-21886dbd6853">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>)</content>.</content>

                  <paragraph>Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent that in animals prolongs survival of allogeneic transplants involving skin, kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, bone marrow, small intestine, and lung. Cyclosporine has been demonstrated to suppress some humoral immunity and to a greater extent, cell-mediated immune reactions such as allograft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, Freund’s adjuvant arthritis, and graft versus host disease in many animal species for a variety of organs.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The effectiveness of cyclosporine results from specific and reversible inhibition of immunocompetent lymphocytes in the G<sub>0</sub>- and G<sub>1</sub>-phase of the cell cycle. T-lymphocytes are preferentially inhibited. The T-helper cell is the main target, although the T-suppressor cell may also be suppressed. Cyclosporine also inhibits lymphokine production and release, including interleukin-2.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph> No effects on phagocytic function (changes in enzyme secretions, chemotactic migration of granulocytes, macrophage migration, carbon clearance <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content>) have been detected in animals. Cyclosporine does not cause bone marrow suppression in animal models or man.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The immunosuppressive activity of cyclosporine is primarily due to parent drug. Following oral administration, absorption of cyclosporine is incomplete. The extent of absorption of cyclosporine is dependent on the individual patient, the patient population, and the formulation. Elimination of cyclosporine is primarily biliary with only 6% of the dose (parent drug and metabolites) excreted in urine. The disposition of cyclosporine from blood is generally biphasic, with a terminal half-life of approximately 8.4 hours (range 5 to 18 hours). Following intravenous administration, the blood clearance of cyclosporine (assay: HPLC) is approximately 5 to 7 mL/min/kg in adult recipients of renal or liver allografts. Blood cyclosporine clearance appears to be slightly slower in cardiac transplant patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The cyclosporine capsules, USP MODIFIED and cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED are bioequivalent. Cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED diluted with orange juice or apple juice is bioequivalent to cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED diluted with water. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cyclosporine when administered as cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED has not been evaluated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> The relationship between administered dose and exposure (area under the concentration versus time curve, AUC) is linear within the therapeutic dose range. The intersubject variability (total, %CV) of cyclosporine exposure (AUC) when cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED or Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) is administered ranges from approximately 20% to 50% in renal transplant patients. This intersubject variability contributes to the need for individualization of the dosing regimen for optimal therapy <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_49f7da83-ca84-4370-bc36-21886dbd6853">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION)</linkHtml>
                           </content>. Intrasubject variability of AUC in renal transplant recipients (%CV) was 9% to 21% for cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED and 19% to 26% for Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP). In the same studies, intrasubject variability of trough concentrations (%CV) was 17% to 30% for cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED and 16% to 38% for Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED has increased bioavailability compared to Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP). The absolute bioavailability of cyclosporine administered as Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) is dependent on the patient population, estimated to be less than 10% in liver transplant patients and as great as 89% in some renal transplant patients. The absolute bioavailability of cyclosporine administered as cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED has not been determined in adults. In studies of renal transplant, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients, the mean cyclosporine AUC was approximately 20% to 50% greater and the peak blood cyclosporine concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) was approximately 40% to 106% greater following administration of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED compared to following administration of Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP). The dose normalized AUC in de novo liver transplant patients administered cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED 28 days after transplantation was 50% greater and C<sub>max</sub> was 90% greater than in those patients administered Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP). AUC and C<sub>max</sub> are also increased (cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED relative to Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP)) in heart transplant patients, but data are very limited. Although the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> values are higher on cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED relative to Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP), the predose trough concentrations (dose-normalized) are similar for the two formulations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following oral administration of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED, the time to peak blood cyclosporine concentrations (T<sub>max</sub>) ranged from 1.5 to 2.0 hours. The administration of food with cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED decreases the cyclosporine AUC and C<sub>max</sub>. A high fat meal (669 kcal, 45 grams fat) consumed within one-half hour before cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED administration decreased the AUC by 13% and C<sub>max</sub> by 33%. The effects of a low-fat meal (667 kcal, 15 grams fat) were similar.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> The effect of T-tube diversion of bile on the absorption of cyclosporine from cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED was investigated in eleven de novo liver transplant patients. When the patients were administered cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED with and without T-tube diversion of bile, very little difference in absorption was observed, as measured by the change in maximal cyclosporine blood concentrations from pre-dose values with the T-tube closed relative to when it was open: 6.9 ± 41% (range 55% to 68%).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cyclosporine is distributed largely outside the blood volume. The steady state volume of distribution during intravenous dosing has been reported as 3 to 5 L/kg in solid organ transplant recipients. In blood, the distribution is concentration dependent. Approximately 33% to 47% is in plasma, 4% to 9% in lymphocytes, 5% to 12% in granulocytes, and 41% to 58% in erythrocytes. At high concentrations, the binding capacity of leukocytes and erythrocytes becomes saturated. In plasma, approximately 90% is bound to proteins, primarily lipoproteins. Cyclosporine is excreted in human milk <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_53598935-27d3-408f-a240-fe08880ddb0d">PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers</linkHtml>)</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 3A enzyme system in the liver, and to a lesser degree in the gastrointestinal tract, and the kidney. The metabolism of cyclosporine can be altered by the coadministration of a variety of agents <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_68a4e7d9-bf5a-456e-bcbf-9feb8cda6420">PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions</linkHtml>)</content>. At least 25 metabolites have been identified from human bile, feces, blood, and urine. The biological activity of the metabolites and their contributions to toxicity are considerably less than those of the parent compound. The major metabolites (M1, M9, and M4N) result from oxidation at the 1-beta, 9-gamma, and 4-N-demethylated positions, respectively. At steady state following the oral administration of Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP), the mean AUCs for blood concentrations of M1, M9, and M4N are about 70%, 21%, and 7.5% of the AUC for blood cyclosporine concentrations, respectively. Based on blood concentration data from stable renal transplant patients [13 patients administered cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED and Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) in a crossover study], and bile concentration data from de novo liver transplant patients (4 administered cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED; 3 administered Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP)), the percentage of dose present as M1, M9, and M4N metabolites is similar when either cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED or Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) is administered.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In a study performed in 4 subjects with end-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance &lt; 5 mL/min), an intravenous infusion of 3.5 mg/kg of cyclosporine over 4 hours administered at the end of a hemodialysis session resulted in a mean volume of distribution (Vdss) of 3.49 L/kg and systemic clearance (CL) of 0.369 L/hr/kg. This systemic CL (0.369 L/hr/kg) was approximately two thirds of the mean systemic CL (0.56 L/hr/kg) of cyclosporine in historical control subjects with normal renal function. In 5 liver transplant patients, the mean clearance of cyclosporine on and off hemodialysis was 463 mL/min and 398 mL/min, respectively. Less than 1% of the dose of cyclosporine was recovered in the dialysate.</paragraph>

In 15 renal transplant patients aged 3 to 16 years, cyclosporine whole blood clearance after IV administration of Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) was 10.6 ± 3.7 mL/min/kg (assay: Cyclo-trac specific RIA). In a study of 7 renal transplant patients aged 2 to 16, the cyclosporine clearance ranged from 9.8 to 15.5 mL/min/kg. In 9 liver transplant patients aged 0.6 to 5.6 years, clearance was 9.3 ± 5.4 mL/min/kg (assay: HPLC).</paragraph>

In 7 liver <content styleCode="italics">de novo </content>transplant patients aged 1.4 to 10 years, the absolute bioavailability of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED was 43% (range 30% to 68%) and for Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) in the same individuals absolute bioavailability was 28% (range 17% to 42%).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Study 651 enrolled 264 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis with at least 20 involved joints, who had failed at least one major RA drug, using a 3:3:2 randomization to one of the following three groups: (1) cyclosporine dosed at 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day, (2) methotrexate at 7.5 to 15 mg/week, or (3) placebo. Treatment duration was 24 weeks. The mean cyclosporine dose at the last visit was 3.1 mg/kg/day. See graph below.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Study 652 enrolled 250 patients with active RA with &gt; 6 active painful or tender joints who had failed at least one major RA drug. Patients were randomized using a 3:3:2 randomization to 1 of 3 treatment arms: (1) 1.5 to 5 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine, (2) 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine, and (3) placebo. Treatment duration was 16 weeks. The mean cyclosporine dose for group 2 at the last visit was 2.92 mg/kg/day. See graph below.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Study 2008 enrolled 144 patients with active RA and &gt; 6 active joints who had unsuccessful treatment courses of aspirin and gold or Penicillamine. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (1) cyclosporine 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day with adjustments after the first month to achieve a target trough level and (2) placebo. Treatment duration was 24 weeks. The mean cyclosporine dose at the last visit was 3.63 mg/kg/day. See graph below.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Study 654 enrolled 148 patients who remained with active joint counts of 6 or more despite treatment with maximally tolerated methotrexate doses for at least three months. Patients continued to take their current dose of methotrexate and were randomized to receive, in addition, one of the following medications: (1) cyclosporine 2.5 mg/kg/day with dose increases of 0.5 mg/kg/day at weeks 2 and 4 if there was no evidence of toxicity and further increases of 0.5 mg/kg/day at weeks 8 and 16 if a &lt; 30% decrease in active joint count occurred without any significant toxicity; dose decreases could be made at any time for toxicity or (2) placebo. Treatment duration was 24 weeks. The mean cyclosporine dose at the last visit was 2.8 mg/kg/day (range: 1.3 to 4.1). See graph below.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph> Study 302 enrolled 299 patients with severe active RA, 99% of whom were unresponsive or intolerant to at least one prior major RA drug. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (1) cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED and (2) cyclosporine, both of which were started at 2.5 mg/kg/day and increased after 4 weeks for inefficacy in increments of 0.5 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 5 mg/kg/day and decreased at any time for toxicity. Treatment duration was 24 weeks. The mean cyclosporine dose at the last visit was 2.91 mg/kg/day (range: 0.72 to 5.17) for cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED and 3.27 mg/kg/day (range: 0.73 to 5.68) for cyclosporine.

                              <paragraph>Cyclosporine, the active ingredient of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED, can cause nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity when used in high doses. It is not unusual for serum creatinine and BUN levels to be elevated during cyclosporine therapy. These elevations in renal transplant patients do not necessarily indicate rejection, and each patient must be fully evaluated before dosage adjustment is initiated.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Based on the historical Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) experience with oral solution, nephrotoxicity associated with cyclosporine had been noted in 25% of cases of renal transplantation, 38% of cases of cardiac transplantation, and 37% of cases of liver transplantation. Mild nephrotoxicity was generally noted 2 to 3 months after renal transplant and consisted of an arrest in the fall of the pre-operative elevations of BUN and creatinine at a range of 35 to 45 mg/dL and 2.0 to 2.5 mg/dL, respectively. These elevations were often responsive to cyclosporine dosage reduction.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>More overt nephrotoxicity was seen early after transplantation and was characterized by a rapidly rising BUN and creatinine. Since these events are similar to renal rejection episodes, care must be taken to differentiate between them. This form of nephrotoxicity is usually responsive to cyclosporine dosage reduction.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph> Although specific diagnostic criteria which reliably differentiate renal graft rejection from drug toxicity have not been found, a number of parameters have been significantly associated with one or the other. It should be noted however, that up to 20% of patients may have simultaneous nephrotoxicity and rejection.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>A form of a cyclosporine-associated nephropathy is characterized by serial deterioration in renal function and morphologic changes in the kidneys. From 5% to 15% of transplant recipients who have received cyclosporine will fail to show a reduction in rising serum creatinine despite a decrease or discontinuation of cyclosporine therapy. Renal biopsies from these patients will demonstrate one or several of the following alterations: tubular vacuolization, tubular microcalcifications, peritubular capillary congestion, arteriolopathy, and a striped form of interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy. Though none of these morphologic changes is entirely specific, a diagnosis of cyclosporine-associated structural nephrotoxicity requires evidence of these findings.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>When considering the development of cyclosporine-associated nephropathy, it is noteworthy that several authors have reported an association between the appearance of interstitial fibrosis and higher cumulative doses or persistently high circulating trough concentrations of cyclosporine. This is particularly true during the first 6 post-transplant months when the dosage tends to be highest and when, in kidney recipients, the organ appears to be most vulnerable to the toxic effects of cyclosporine. Among other contributing factors to the development of interstitial fibrosis in these patients are prolonged perfusion time, warm ischemia time, as well as episodes of acute toxicity, and acute and chronic rejection. The reversibility of interstitial fibrosis and its correlation to renal function have not yet been determined. Reversibility of arteriolopathy has been reported after stopping cyclosporine or lowering the dosage.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Impaired renal function at any time requires close monitoring, and frequent dosage adjustment may be indicated.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the event of severe and unremitting rejection, when rescue therapy with pulse steroids and monoclonal antibodies fail to reverse the rejection episode, it may be preferable to switch to alternative immunosuppressive therapy rather than increase the cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED dose to excessive blood concentrations.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph> Due to the potential for additive or synergistic impairment of renal function, caution should be exercised when coadministering cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED with other drugs that may impair renal function <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_68a4e7d9-bf5a-456e-bcbf-9feb8cda6420">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>, Drug Interactions).</content>

                              <paragraph>Occasionally patients have developed a syndrome of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia which may result in graft failure. The vasculopathy can occur in the absence of rejection and is accompanied by avid platelet consumption within the graft as demonstrated by Indium 111 labeled platelet studies. Neither the pathogenesis nor the management of this syndrome is clear. Though resolution has occurred after reduction or discontinuation of cyclosporine and 1) administration of streptokinase and heparin or 2) plasmapheresis, this appears to depend upon early detection with Indium 111 labeled platelet scans <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_07bcfd62-efb7-4971-b3cc-22ca5b81b981">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>As in patients receiving other immunosuppressants, those patients receiving cyclosporine are at increased risk for development of lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly those of the skin. Patients taking cyclosporine should be warned to avoid excess ultraviolet light exposure. The increased risk appears related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of specific agents. Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system resulting in increased risk of infection or malignancy, a treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants should be used with caution. Some malignancies may be fatal. Transplant patients receiving cyclosporine are at increased risk for serious infection with fatal outcome.</paragraph>

Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious, and sometimes, fatal outcomes. These include cases of JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), especially due to BK virus infection, which have been observed in patients receiving cyclosporine. PVAN is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss, <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_608a0839-e202-47a7-93ff-31c7e6aff5fc">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>, Postmarketing Experience, Kidney, Liver and Heart Transplantation)</content>.

                              <paragraph>Cases of PML have been reported in patients treated with cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED. PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph> Consideration should be given to reducing the total immunosuppression in transplant patients who develop PML or PVAN. However, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>There have been reports of convulsions in adult and pediatric patients receiving cyclosporine, particularly in combination with high dose methylprednisolone.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Encephalopathy, including Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), has been described both in postmarketing reports and in the literature. Manifestations include impaired consciousness, convulsions, visual disturbances (including blindness), loss of motor function, movement disorders and psychiatric disturbances. In many cases, changes in the white matter have been detected using imaging techniques and pathologic specimens. Predisposing factors, such as hypertension, hypomagnesemia, hypocholesterolemia, high-dose corticosteroids, high cyclosporine blood concentrations, and graft-versus-host disease, have been noted in many but not all of the reported cases. The changes in most cases have been reversible upon discontinuation of cyclosporine, and in some cases improvement was noted after reduction of dose. It appears that patients receiving liver transplant are more susceptible to encephalopathy than those receiving kidney transplant. Another rare manifestation of cyclosporine-induced neurotoxicity, occurring in transplant patients more frequently than in other indications, is optic disc edema including papilloedema, with possible visual impairment, secondary to benign intracranial hypertension.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cyclosporine nephropathy was detected in renal biopsies of 6 out of 60 (10%) rheumatoid arthritis patients after the average treatment duration of 19 months. Only one patient, out of these 6 patients, was treated with a dose ≤ 4 mg/kg/day. Serum creatinine improved in all but one patient after discontinuation of cyclosporine. The “maximal creatinine increase” appears to be a factor in predicting cyclosporine nephropathy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is a potential, as with other immunosuppressive agents, for an increase in the occurrence of malignant lymphomas with cyclosporine. It is not clear whether the risk with cyclosporine is greater than that in rheumatoid arthritis patients or in rheumatoid arthritis patients on cytotoxic treatment for this indication. Five cases of lymphoma were detected: four in a survey of approximately 2,300 patients treated with cyclosporine for rheumatoid arthritis, and another case of lymphoma was reported in a clinical trial. Although other tumors (12 skin cancers, 24 solid tumors of diverse types, and 1 multiple myeloma) were also reported in this survey, epidemiologic analyses did not support a relationship to cyclosporine other than for malignant lymphomas.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Patients should be thoroughly evaluated before and during cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED treatment for the development of malignancies. Moreover, use of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED therapy with other immunosuppressive agents may induce an excessive immunosuppression which is known to increase the risk of malignancy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Since cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent with a number of potentially serious side effects, the risks and benefits of using cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED should be considered before treatment of patients with psoriasis. Cyclosporine, the active ingredient in cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED, can cause nephrotoxicity and hypertension <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_2f5e93fe-11ab-455d-905d-b4cec537acf9">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>) </content>and the risk increases with increasing dose and duration of therapy. Patients who may be at increased risk, such as those with abnormal renal function, uncontrolled hypertension or malignancies, should not receive cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Renal dysfunction is a potential consequence of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED therefore renal function must be monitored during therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients receiving cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED require frequent monitoring of serum creatinine <content styleCode="italics">(see Special Monitoring under <linkHtml href="#LINK_49f7da83-ca84-4370-bc36-21886dbd6853">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml>)</content>. Elderly patients should be monitored with particular care, since decreases in renal function also occur with age. If patients are not properly monitored and doses are not properly adjusted, cyclosporine therapy can cause structural kidney damage and persistent renal dysfunction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An increase in serum creatinine and BUN may occur during cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED therapy and reflects a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Kidney biopsies from 86 psoriasis patients treated for a mean duration of 23 months with 1.2 to 7.6 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine showed evidence of cyclosporine nephropathy in 18/86 (21%) of the patients. The pathology consisted of renal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. On repeat biopsy of 13 of these patients maintained on various dosages of cyclosporine for a mean of 2 additional years, the number with cyclosporine induced nephropathy rose to 26/86 (30%). The majority of patients (19/26) were on a dose of ≥ 5.0 mg/kg/day (the highest recommended dose is 4 mg/kg/day). The patients were also on cyclosporine for greater than 15 months (18/26) and/or had a clinically significant increase in serum creatinine for greater than 1 month (21/26). Creatinine levels returned to normal range in 7 of 11 patients in whom cyclosporine therapy was discontinued.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is an increased risk for the development of skin and lymphoproliferative malignancies in cyclosporine-treated psoriasis patients. The relative risk of malignancies is comparable to that observed in psoriasis patients treated with other immunosuppressive agents.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tumors were reported in 32 (2.2%) of 1439 psoriasis patients treated with cyclosporine worldwide from clinical trials. Additional tumors have been reported in 7 patients in cyclosporine postmarketing experience. Skin malignancies were reported in 16 (1.1%) of these patients; all but 2 of them had previously received PUVA therapy. Methotrexate was received by 7 patients. UVB and coal tar had been used by 2 and 3 patients, respectively. Seven patients had either a history of previous skin cancer or a potentially predisposing lesion was present prior to cyclosporine exposure. Of the 16 patients with skin cancer, 11 patients had 18 squamous cell carcinomas and 7 patients had 10 basal cell carcinomas.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There were two lymphoproliferative malignancies; one case of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma which required chemotherapy, and one case of mycosis fungoides which regressed spontaneously upon discontinuation of cyclosporine. There were four cases of benign lymphocytic infiltration: 3 regressed spontaneously upon discontinuation of cyclosporine, while the fourth regressed despite continuation of the drug. The remainder of the malignancies, 13 cases (0.9%), involved various organs.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Cyclosporine is the active ingredient of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED. Hypertension is a common side effect of cyclosporine therapy which may persist <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_07bcfd62-efb7-4971-b3cc-22ca5b81b981">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#LINK_49f7da83-ca84-4370-bc36-21886dbd6853">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</linkHtml> </content>for monitoring recommendations<content styleCode="italics">)</content>. Mild or moderate hypertension is encountered more frequently than severe hypertension and the incidence decreases over time. In recipients of kidney, liver, and heart allografts treated with cyclosporine, antihypertensive therapy may be required <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_777f868e-2c54-4751-8700-0f216150757c">Special Monitoring of Rheumatoid Arthritis</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#LINK_2c704bab-3016-40ca-825c-92ccd3fa2913">Psoriasis Patients</linkHtml>)</content>. However, since cyclosporine may cause hyperkalemia, potassium-sparing diuretics should not be used. While calcium antagonists can be effective agents in treating cyclosporine-associated hypertension, they can interfere with cyclosporine metabolism <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_68a4e7d9-bf5a-456e-bcbf-9feb8cda6420">Drug Interactions</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Before initiating treatment, a careful dermatological and physical examination, including blood pressure measurements (on at least two occasions) should be performed. Since cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED is an immunosuppressive agent, patients should be evaluated for the presence of occult infection on their first physical examination and for the presence of tumors initially, and throughout treatment with cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED. Skin lesions not typical for psoriasis should be biopsied before starting cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED. Patients with malignant or premalignant changes of the skin should be treated with cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED only after appropriate treatment of such lesions and if no other treatment option exists.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Baseline laboratories should include serum creatinine (on two occasions), BUN, CBC, serum magnesium, potassium, uric acid, and lipids.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The risk of cyclosporine nephropathy is reduced when the starting dose is low (2.5 mg/kg/day), the maximum dose does not exceed 4.0 mg/kg/day, serum creatinine is monitored regularly while cyclosporine is administered, and the dose of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED is decreased when the rise in creatinine is greater than or equal to 25% above the patient's pretreatment level. The increase in creatinine is generally reversible upon timely decrease of the dose of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED or its discontinuation.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Serum creatinine and BUN should be evaluated every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months of therapy and then monthly if the patient is stable. If the serum creatinine is greater than or equal to 25% above the patient’s pretreatment level, serum creatinine should be repeated within two weeks. If the change in serum creatinine remains greater than or equal to 25% above baseline, cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED should be reduced by 25% to 50%. If at <content styleCode="bold">any time </content>the serum creatinine increases by greater than or equal to 50% above pretreatment level, cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED should be reduced by 25% to 50%. Cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED should be discontinued if reversibility (within 25% of baseline) of serum creatinine is not achievable after two dosage modifications. It is advisable to monitor serum creatinine after an increase of the dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and after initiation of new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy during cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED treatment.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Blood pressure should be evaluated every 2 weeks during the initial 3 months of therapy and then monthly if the patient is stable, or more frequently when dosage adjustments are made. Patients without a history of previous hypertension before initiation of treatment with cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED, should have the drug reduced by 25% to 50% if found to have sustained hypertension. If the patient continues to be hypertensive despite multiple reductions of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED, then cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED should be discontinued. For patients with treated hypertension, before the initiation of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED therapy, their medication should be adjusted to control hypertension while on cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED. Cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED should be discontinued if a change in hypertension management is not effective or tolerable.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>CBC, uric acid, potassium, lipids, and magnesium should also be monitored every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of therapy, and then monthly if the patient is stable or more frequently when dosage adjustments are made. Cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED dosage should be reduced by 25% to 50% for any abnormality of clinical concern.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph> In controlled trials of cyclosporine in psoriasis patients, cyclosporine blood concentrations did not correlate well with either improvement or with side effects such as renal dysfunction.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A isoenzymes, in particular CYP3A4, and is a substrate of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Various agents are known to either increase or decrease plasma or whole blood concentrations of cyclosporine usually by inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein transporter or both. Compounds that decrease cyclosporine absorption, such as orlistat, should be avoided. Appropriate cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED dosage adjustment to achieve the desired cyclosporine concentrations is essential when drugs that significantly alter cyclosporine concentrations are used concomitantly <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_84579c31-60e5-40ed-9e31-a0de5db19042">Blood Concentration Monitoring</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>

The HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) are known to inhibit cytochrome P-450 3A and thus could potentially increase the concentrations of cyclosporine, however no formal studies of the interaction are available. Care should be exercised when these drugs are administered concomitantly.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Grapefruit Juice<br/>
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice affect metabolism, increasing blood concentrations of cyclosporine, thus should be avoided.</paragraph>

                           <title>B. Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents</title>
                           <text>
                              <paragraph>Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of multiple drug efflux transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein) and may increase plasma concentrations of comedications that are substrates of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein or organic anion transporter proteins.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Cyclosporine may reduce the clearance of digoxin, colchicine, prednisolone, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and, aliskiren, bosentan, dabigatran, repaglinide, NSAIDs, sirolimus, etoposide, and other drugs.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>
                                 <content styleCode="italics">See the full prescribing information of the other drug for further information and specific recommendations. The decision on coadministration of cyclosporine with other drugs or agents should be made by the healthcare provider following the careful assessment of benefits and risks.</content>
                              </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Digoxin<br/>
Severe digitalis toxicity has been seen within days of starting cyclosporine in several patients taking digoxin. If digoxin is used concurrently with cyclosporine, serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Colchicine<br/>
There are reports on the potential of cyclosporine to enhance the toxic effects of colchicine such as myopathy and neuropathy, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and colchicine results in significant increases in colchicine plasma concentrations. If colchicine is used concurrently with cyclosporine, a reduction in the dosage of colchicine is recommended.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)<br/>
Literature and postmarketing cases of myotoxicity, including muscle pain and weakness, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with concomitant administration of cyclosporine with lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and, rarely fluvastatin. When concurrently administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of these statins should be reduced according to label recommendations. Statin therapy needs to be temporarily withheld or discontinued in patients with signs and symptoms of myopathy or those with risk factors predisposing to severe renal injury, including renal failure, secondary to rhabdomyolysis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Repaglinide<br/>
Cyclosporine may increase the plasma concentrations of repaglinide and thereby increase the risk of hypoglycemia. In 12 healthy male subjects who received two doses of 100 mg cyclosporine capsule orally 12 hours apart with a single dose of 0.25 mg repaglinide tablet (one-half of a 0.5 mg tablet) orally 13 hours after the cyclosporine initial dose, the repaglinide mean C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were increased 1.8-fold (range: 0.6 to 3.7-fold) and 2.4-fold (range 1.2 to 5.3-fold), respectively. Close monitoring of blood glucose level is advisable for a patient taking cyclosporine and repaglinide concomitantly.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Ambrisentan<br/>
Coadministration of ambrisentan (5 mg daily) and cyclosporine (100 to 150 mg twice daily initially, then dosing to achieve C<sub>min</sub> 150 to 200 ng/mL) for 8 days in healthy subjects resulted in mean increases in ambrisentan AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of approximately 2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared to ambrisentan alone. When coadministering ambrisentan with cyclosporine, the ambrisentan dose should not be titrated to the recommended maximum daily dose.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Anthracycline antibiotics<br/>
High doses of cyclosporine (e.g., at starting intravenous dose of 16 mg/kg/day) may increase the exposure to anthracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) in cancer patients.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Aliskiren<br/>
Cyclosporine alters the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren, a substrate of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4. In 14 healthy subjects who received concomitantly single doses of cyclosporine (200 mg) and reduced dose aliskiren (75 mg), the mean C<sub>max</sub> of aliskiren was increased by approximately 2.5-fold (90% CI: 1.96 to 3.17) and the mean AUC by approximately 4.3-fold (90% CI: 3.52 to 5.21), compared to when these subjects received aliskiren alone. The concomitant administration of aliskiren with cyclosporine prolonged the median aliskiren elimination half-life (26 hours versus 43 to 45 hours) and the T<sub>max</sub> (0.5 hours versus 1.5 to 2.0 hours). The mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of cyclosporine were comparable to reported literature values. Coadministration of cyclosporine and aliskiren in these subjects also resulted in an increase in the number and/or intensity of adverse events, mainly headache, hot flush, nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. The coadministration of cyclosporine with aliskiren is not recommended.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Bosentan<br/>
In healthy subjects, coadministration of bosentan and cyclosporine resulted in time-dependent mean increases in dose-normalized bosentan trough concentrations (i.e., approximately 21-fold on day 1 and 2-fold on day 8 (steady state)) compared to when bosentan was given alone as a single dose on day 1 <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_d8d2fa81-5819-4ece-b9e5-c0f9c5462565">Effect of Drugs and Other Agents on Cyclosporine Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety</linkHtml>)</content>. Coadministration of cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Dabigatran<br/>
The effect of cyclosporine on dabigatran concentrations had not been formally studied. Concomitant administration of dabigatran and cyclosporine may result in increased plasma dabigatran concentrations due to the P-gp inhibitory activity of cyclosporine. Coadministration of cyclosporine with dabigatran should be avoided.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Potassium-Sparing Diuretics<br/>
Cyclosporine should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics because hyperkalemia can occur. Caution is also required when cyclosporine is coadministered with potassium sparing drugs (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists), potassium-containing drugs as well as in patients on a potassium rich diet. Control of potassium levels in these situations is advisable.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Interactions<br/>
Clinical status and serum creatinine should be closely monitored when cyclosporine is used with NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis patients <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_98eb58dc-30d8-4051-b8e1-066de0a89144">WARNINGS</linkHtml>)</content>.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Pharmacodynamic interactions have been reported to occur between cyclosporine and both naproxen and sulindac, in that concomitant use is associated with additive decreases in renal function, as determined by <sup>99m</sup>Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and (<content styleCode="italics">p</content>-aminohippuric acid) PAH clearances. Although concomitant administration of diclofenac does not affect blood concentrations of cyclosporine, it has been associated with approximate doubling of diclofenac blood concentrations and occasional reports of reversible decreases in renal function. Consequently, the dose of diclofenac should be in the lower end of the therapeutic range.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Methotrexate Interaction<br/>
Preliminary data indicate that when methotrexate and cyclosporine were coadministered to rheumatoid arthritis patients (N = 20), methotrexate concentrations (AUCs) were increased approximately 30% and the concentrations (AUCs) of its metabolite, 7-hydroxy methotrexate, were decreased by approximately 80%. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. Cyclosporine concentrations do not appear to have been altered (N = 6).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Sirolimus<br/>
Elevations in serum creatinine were observed in studies using sirolimus in combination with full-dose cyclosporine. This effect is often reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Simultaneous coadministration of cyclosporine significantly increases blood levels of sirolimus. To minimize increases in sirolimus concentrations, it is recommended that sirolimus be given 4 hours after cyclosporine administration.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Nifedipine<br/>
Frequent gingival hyperplasia when nifedipine is given concurrently with cyclosporine has been reported. The concomitant use of nifedipine should be avoided in patients in whom gingival hyperplasia develops as a side effect of cyclosporine.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Methylprednisolone<br/>
Convulsions when high dose methylprednisolone is given concurrently with cyclosporine have been reported.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Other Immunosuppressive Drugs and Agents<br/>
Psoriasis patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy (including PUVA and UVB) should not receive concurrent cyclosporine because of the possibility of excessive immunosuppression.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>
                                 <content styleCode="italics">Interactions resulting in decrease of other drug levels<br/>
                                 </content>Cyclosporine inhibits the enterohepatic circulation of mycophenolic acid (MPA). Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium in transplant patients may decrease the mean exposure of MPA by 20 to 50% when compared with other immunosuppressants, which could reduce efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium. Monitor patients for alterations in efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium, when they are coadministered with cyclosporine.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Carcinogenicity studies were carried out in male and female rats and mice. In the 78-week mouse study, evidence of a statistically significant trend was found for lymphocytic lymphomas in females, and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in mid-dose (0.03 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA) males significantly exceeded the control value. In the 24-month rat study, pancreatic islet cell adenomas significantly exceeded the control rate in the low dose level (0.006 times the MRHD based on BSA). The hepatocellular carcinomas and pancreatic islet cell adenomas were not dose related. Published reports indicate that co-treatment of hairless mice with UV irradiation and cyclosporine or other immunosuppressive agents shorten the time to skin tumor formation compared to UV irradiation alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cyclosporine has not been found to be mutagenic/genotoxic in the Ames Test, the V79-HGPRT Test, the micronucleus test in mice and Chinese hamsters, the chromosome-aberration tests in Chinese hamster bone-marrow, the mouse dominant lethal assay, and the DNA-repair test in sperm from treated mice. A recent study analyzing sister chromatid exchange (SCE) induction by cyclosporine using human lymphocytes <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>gave indication of a positive effect (i.e., induction of SCE), at high concentrations in this system.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a fertility study in rats, increased perinatal mortality and impaired postnatal development of F1 pups were observed at 15 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA). No adverse effects on fertility and reproduction were observed up to 5 mg/kg/day (0.06 times the MRHD based on BSA) in male and female rats.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Widely distributed papillomatosis of the skin was observed after chronic treatment of dogs with cyclosporine at 9 times the human initial psoriasis treatment dose of 2.5 mg/kg, where doses are expressed on a body surface area basis. This papillomatosis showed a spontaneous regression upon discontinuation of cyclosporine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An increased incidence of malignancy is a recognized complication of immunosuppression in recipients of organ transplants and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The most common forms of neoplasms are non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and carcinomas of the skin. The risk of malignancies in cyclosporine recipients is higher than in the normal, healthy population but similar to that in patients receiving other immunosuppressive therapies. Reduction or discontinuance of immunosuppression may cause the lesions to regress.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In psoriasis patients on cyclosporine, development of malignancies, especially those of the skin has been reported <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_98eb58dc-30d8-4051-b8e1-066de0a89144">WARNINGS</linkHtml>)</content>. Skin lesions not typical for psoriasis should be biopsied before starting cyclosporine treatment. Patients with malignant or premalignant changes of the skin should be treated with cyclosporine only after appropriate treatment of such lesions and if no other treatment option exists.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from published literature, including the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International, observational cohort studies, case-controlled studies, meta-analysis, case series, and case reports, over decades of use with cyclosporine in pregnancy have not identified a drug associated risk of major birth defects, or miscarriage. Adverse maternal or fetal outcomes including hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight are increased in patients treated with cyclosporine. However, patients receiving cyclosporine during pregnancy have underlying medical conditions and may be treated with concomitant medications that limit the interpretability of these findings <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Embryo-fetal developmental (EFD) studies in rats and rabbits with cyclosporine have shown embryo-fetal toxicity at dose levels below the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on body surface area (BSA). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry (NTPR) including 622 pregnancies in renal, liver, and heart transplant recipients exposed to cyclosporine during pregnancy found that the overall rate of major birth defects, live birth rates, and miscarriage rates were comparable to the general population. Maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, including the rate of hypertension, preeclampsia, premature births, and low birth weight infants appear to be increased in transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine compared to the general population. However, these patients have underlying medical conditions that confound the above findings. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity in rats and rabbits. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Three EFD studies (two oral and one intravenous) are available in rats. In two EFD studies, pregnant rats were orally administered with cyclosporine either at doses of 10, 17, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day or 4, 10 and 25 mg/kg/day from gestation day (GD) 6 to 15 or from GD 7 to 17, respectively. Maternal toxicity characterized by mortality, clinical signs of toxicity and impaired body weight gain were observed at 30 mg/kg/day and above. Cyclosporine was embryo- and fetotoxic as indicated by increased embryonic mortality and reduced fetal weight together with skeletal retardations in rats at 25 mg/kg/day and above. In addition, ventricular septal defect was observed at 25 mg/kg/day in fetuses. In the first study, the oral no observed effect level (NOEL) for both dams and fetuses was 17 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA). In the other oral study, the NOEL for dams and fetuses were 10 and 4 mg/kg/day (0.13 and 0.05 times the MRHD based on BSA), respectively. In the IV EFD study, rats were administered with 3, 6 and 12 mg/kg/day of cyclosporine from GD 7 to 17. An increase in post implantation loss was observed at 12 mg/kg/day; ventricular septal defect was observed at ≥ 6 mg/kg/day in fetuses. The IV NOEL for dams and fetus were 6 and 3 mg/kg/day (0.08 and 0.04 times the MRHD, respectively, based on BSA), respectively, after IV administration. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In rabbits, cyclosporine was orally administered at dose levels of 10, 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg/day from GD 6 to 18. At 100 mg/kg/day and above, reduction in body weight gain of dams and at 300 mg/kg/day abortions were observed. Maternal toxicity, embryo-fetotoxicity as indicated by increased pre- and postnatal mortality, reduced fetal weight together with skeletal retardations were observed at 100 mg/kg/day and above. The NOEL for dams and fetuses was 30 mg/kg/day (1 times the MRHD based on BSA). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In two published research studies, rabbits exposed to cyclosporine in utero (10 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) demonstrated reduced numbers of nephrons, renal hypertrophy, systemic hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency up to 35 weeks of age. These findings have not been demonstrated in other species and their relevance for humans is unknown. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In a peri- and postnatal development study in rats, pregnant rats were orally administered with cyclosporine (5, 15 or 45 mg/kg/day) from GD 15 until end of lactation. At 45 mg/kg/day (0.5 times the MRHD based on BSA), increased pre and postnatal mortality of offspring and reduced body weight gain of surviving pups were observed. Cyclosporine up to 15 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the MRHD based on BSA) had no effect on pregnancy, pre and postnatal development of offspring.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED in transplant and psoriasis patients did not include a sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

                           <text>
                              <paragraph>Hypomagnesemia has been reported in some, but not all, patients exhibiting convulsions while on cyclosporine therapy. Although magnesium-depletion studies in normal subjects suggest that hypomagnesemia is associated with neurologic disorders, multiple factors, including hypertension, high dose methylprednisolone, hypocholesterolemia, and nephrotoxicity associated with high plasma concentrations of cyclosporine appear to be related to the neurological manifestations of cyclosporine toxicity.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In rheumatoid arthritis patients treated in clinical trials within the recommended dose range, cyclosporine therapy was discontinued in 5.3% of the patients because of hypertension and in 7% of the patients because of increased creatinine. These changes are usually reversible with timely dose decrease or drug discontinuation. The frequency and severity of serum creatinine elevations increase with dose and duration of cyclosporine therapy. These elevations are likely to become more pronounced without dose reduction or discontinuation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The principal adverse reactions associated with the use of cyclosporine in patients with psoriasis are renal dysfunction, headache, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hirsutism/hypertrichosis, paresthesia or hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, lethargy, and musculoskeletal or joint pain.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In psoriasis patients treated in US controlled clinical studies within the recommended dose range, cyclosporine therapy was discontinued in 1.0% of the patients because of hypertension and in 5.4% of the patients because of increased creatinine. In the majority of cases, these changes were reversible after dose reduction or discontinuation of cyclosporine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There has been one reported death associated with the use of cyclosporine in psoriasis. A 27-year-old male developed renal deterioration and was continued on cyclosporine. He had progressive renal failure leading to death.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Frequency and severity of serum creatinine increases with dose and duration of cyclosporine therapy. These elevations are likely to become more pronounced and may result in irreversible renal damage without dose reduction or discontinuation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Mild hypomagnesemia and hyperkalemia may occur but are asymptomatic. Increases in uric acid may occur and attacks of gout have been rarely reported. A minor and dose related hyperbilirubinemia has been observed in the absence of hepatocellular damage. Cyclosporine therapy may be associated with a modest increase of serum triglycerides or cholesterol. Elevations of triglycerides (&gt; 750 mg/dL) occur in about 15% of psoriasis patients; elevations of cholesterol (&gt; 300 mg/dL) are observed in less than 3% of psoriasis patients. Generally these laboratory abnormalities are reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of cyclosporine.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>There is a minimal experience with cyclosporine overdosage. Forced emesis and gastric lavage can be of value up to 2 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED. Transient hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur which should resolve following drug withdrawal. Oral doses of cyclosporine up to 10 g (about 150 mg/kg) have been tolerated with relatively minor clinical consequences, such as vomiting, drowsiness, headache, tachycardia and, in a few patients, moderately severe, reversible impairment of renal function. However, serious symptoms of intoxication have been reported following accidental parenteral overdosage with cyclosporine in premature neonates. General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be followed in all cases of overdosage. Cyclosporine is not dialyzable to any great extent, nor is it cleared well by charcoal hemoperfusion. The oral dosage at which half of experimental animals are estimated to die is 31 times, 39 times, and &gt; 54 times the human maintenance dose for transplant patients (6 mg/kg; corrections based on body surface area) in mice, rats, and rabbits.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The initial oral dose of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED can be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation or be given postoperatively. The initial dose of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED varies depending on the transplanted organ and the other immunosuppressive agents included in the immunosuppressive protocol. In newly transplanted patients, the initial oral dose of cyclosporine oral solution, MODIFIED is the same as the initial oral dose of Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP). Suggested initial doses are available from the results of a 1994 survey of the use of Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) in US transplant centers. The mean ± SD initial doses were 9 ± 3 mg/kg/day for renal transplant patients (75 centers), 8 ± 4 mg/kg/day for liver transplant patients (30 centers), and 7 ± 3 mg/kg/day for heart transplant patients (24 centers). Total daily doses were divided into two equal daily doses. The cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED dose is subsequently adjusted to achieve a pre-defined cyclosporine blood concentration <content styleCode="italics">(see Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients, below)</content>. If cyclosporine trough blood concentrations are used, the target range is the same for cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED as for Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP). Using the same trough concentration target range for cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED as for Sandimmune (cyclosporine oral solution, USP) results in greater cyclosporine exposure when cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED is administered <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#LINK_a6f942ef-c4cf-4120-aab7-f117d110be4a">Pharmacokinetics, Absorption</linkHtml>)</content>. Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability. Lower cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED doses may be sufficient as maintenance therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended initially. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A representative dosage schedule based on the patient’s weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on status of patient and function of graft. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Patients generally show some improvement in the clinical manifestations of psoriasis in 2 weeks. Satisfactory control and stabilization of the disease may take 12 to 16 weeks to achieve. Results of a dose-titration clinical trial with cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED indicate that an improvement of psoriasis by 75% or more (based on PASI) was achieved in 51% of the patients after 8 weeks and in 79% of the patients after 16 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued if satisfactory response cannot be achieved after 6 weeks at 4 mg/kg/day or the patient’s maximum tolerated dose. Once a patient is adequately controlled and appears stable the dose of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED should be lowered, and the patient treated with the lowest dose that maintains an adequate response (this should not necessarily be total clearing of the patient). In clinical trials, cyclosporine doses at the lower end of the recommended dosage range were effective in maintaining a satisfactory response in 60% of the patients. Doses below 2.5 mg/kg/day may also be equally effective.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Upon stopping treatment with cyclosporine, relapse will occur in approximately 6 weeks (50% of the patients) to 16 weeks (75% of the patients). In the majority of patients rebound does not occur after cessation of treatment with cyclosporine. Thirteen cases of transformation of chronic plaque psoriasis to more severe forms of psoriasis have been reported. There were 9 cases of pustular and 4 cases of erythrodermic psoriasis. Long term experience with cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED in psoriasis patients is limited and continuous treatment for extended periods greater than one year is not recommended. Alternation with other forms of treatment should be considered in the long term management of patients with this life long disease.</paragraph>

The combination of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED solution with milk can be unpalatable. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cyclosporine when administered as cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED has not been evaluated.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Take the prescribed amount of cyclosporine oral solution, USP MODIFIED from the container using the dosing syringe supplied, after removal of the protective cover, and transfer the solution to a glass of orange or apple juice. Stir well and drink at once. Do not allow diluted oral solution to stand before drinking. Use a glass container (not plastic). Rinse the glass with more diluent to ensure that the total dose is consumed. After use, dry the outside of the dosing syringe with a clean towel and replace the protective cover. Do not rinse the dosing syringe with water or other cleaning agents. If the syringe requires cleaning, it must be completely dry before resuming use.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Transplant centers have found blood concentration monitoring of cyclosporine to be an essential component of patient management. Of importance to blood concentration analysis are the type of assay used, the transplanted organ, and other immunosuppressant agents being administered. While no fixed relationship has been established, blood concentration monitoring may assist in the clinical evaluation of rejection and toxicity, dose adjustments, and the assessment of compliance.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Various assays have been used to measure blood concentrations of cyclosporine. Older studies using a nonspecific assay often cited concentrations that were roughly twice those of the specific assays. Therefore, comparison between concentrations in the published literature and an individual patient concentration using current assays must be made with detailed knowledge of the assay methods employed. Current assay results are also not interchangeable and their use should be guided by their approved labeling. A discussion of the different assay methods is contained in <content styleCode="italics">Annals of Clinical Biochemistry </content>1994; 31: 420-446. While several assays and assay matrices are available, there is a consensus that parent-compound-specific assays correlate best with clinical events. Of these, HPLC is the standard reference, but the monoclonal antibody RIAs and the monoclonal antibody FPIA offer sensitivity, reproducibility, and convenience. Most clinicians base their monitoring on trough cyclosporine concentrations. <content styleCode="italics">Applied Pharmacokinetics, Principles of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring </content>(1992) contains a broad discussion of cyclosporine pharmacokinetics and drug monitoring techniques. Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal function monitoring or tissue biopsies.</paragraph>
