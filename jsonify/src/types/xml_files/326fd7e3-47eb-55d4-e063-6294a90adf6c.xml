                              <paragraph>Dosing in patients 2 to 9 years of age is based on weight. During the titration period, the initial dose of topiramate extended-release capsules is 25 mg/day nightly for the first week. Based upon tolerability, the dosage can be increased to 50 mg/day in the second week. Dosage can be increased by 25 mg to 50 mg once daily each subsequent week, as tolerated. Titration to the minimum maintenance dose should be attempted over 5 to 7 weeks. Based upon tolerability and clinical response, additional titration to a higher dose (up to the maximum maintenance dose) can be attempted at 25 mg to 50 mg once daily weekly increments. The total daily dose should not exceed the maximum maintenance dose for each range of body weight (see

Begin titration at 25 mg once daily (or less, based on a range of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day) given nightly for the first week. Subsequently, increase the dosage at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome.

                           <content styleCode="xmChange">A syndrome consisting of acute myopia associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma has been reported in patients receiving topiramate. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity and/or ocular pain. Ophthalmologic findings can include some or all of the following: myopia, mydriasis, anterior chamber shallowing, ocular hyperemia (redness), choroidal detachments, retinal pigment epithelial detachments, macular striae, and increased intraocular pressure. This syndrome may be associated with supraciliary effusion resulting in anterior displacement of the lens and iris, with secondary angle closure glaucoma. Symptoms typically occur within 1 month of initiating topiramate therapy. In contrast to primary narrow angle glaucoma, which is rare under 40 years of age, secondary angle closure glaucoma associated with topiramate has been reported in pediatric patients as well as adults. The primary treatment to reverse symptoms is discontinuation of topiramate extended-release capsules as rapidly as possible, according to the judgment of the treating physician. Other measures, in conjunction with discontinuation of topiramate extended-release, may be helpful.</content>

                        <paragraph>Oligohydrosis (decreased sweating), infrequently resulting in hospitalization in some cases, has been reported in association with topiramate use. Decreased sweating and an elevation in body temperature above normal characterized these cases. Some of the cases were reported after exposure to elevated environmental temperatures.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The majority of the reports have been in pediatric patients. Patients, (especially pediatric patients) treated with topiramate extended-release should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. Caution should be used when topiramate extended-release capsules are prescribed with other drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders; these drugs include, but are not limited to, other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and drugs with anticholinergic activity.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4 Metabolic Acidosis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Topiramate extended-release can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild to moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate extended-release capsules.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with immediate-release topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for immediate-release topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value &lt; 17 mEq/L and &gt;5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="xmChange">Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures

   </content>A one-year, active-controlled study of pediatric patients treated with immediate-release topiramate demonstrated that topiramate decreased lumbar spine bone mineral density and that this lumbar spine bone mineral density decrease was correlated (using change from baseline for lumbar spine Z score at final visit versus lowest post-treatment serum bicarbonate) with decreased serum bicarbonate, a reflection of metabolic acidosis

   </content>. Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates, which may decrease the maximal height achieved. Long-term, open-label treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients with epilepsy are likely to have different growth rates than normal 1 to 24-month old patients. Reductions in length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis

                     <title>5.5 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including topiramate extended-release increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Anyone considering prescribing topiramate extended-release or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Immediate-release topiramate can cause cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions and therefore these are expected to be caused by topiramate extended-release. The most frequent of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) Cognitive-related dysfunction (e.g., confusion, psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, speech or language problems, particularly word-finding difficulties); 2) Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression or mood problems); and 3) Somnolence or fatigue.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In pediatric epilepsy trials (adjunctive and monotherapy), the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was generally lower than that observed in adults. These reactions included psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, speech disorders/related speech problems, and language problems. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients during adjunctive therapy double-blind studies were somnolence and fatigue. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients in the 50 mg/day and 400 mg/day groups during the monotherapy double-blind study were headache, dizziness, anorexia, and somnolence.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In pediatric migraine patients, the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was increased in topiramate-treated patients compared to placebo.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was dose-dependent and was greatest at the highest dose (200 mg). This risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was also greater in younger patients (6 to 11 years of age) than in older patients (12 to 17 years of age). The most common cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reaction in these trials was difficulty with concentration/attention. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during the titration period and sometimes persisted for various durations after completion of titration.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was administered to adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) to assess the effects of topiramate on cognitive function at baseline and at the end of the Study 13

Twenty-one percent of immediate-release topiramate-treated patients experienced clinically important reductions in BMD (Z score change from baseline of -0.5 or greater) compared to 0 patients in the control group. Although decreases in BMD occurred across all pediatric age subgroups, patients 6 to 9 years of age were most commonly affected. The sample size and study duration were too small to determine if fracture risk is increased. Decreased BMD in the lumbar spine was correlated with decreased serum bicarbonate, which commonly occurs with topiramate treatment and reflects metabolic acidosis, a known cause of increased bone resorption

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Topiramate increases the risk of kidney stones. During adjunctive epilepsy trials, the risk for kidney stones in immediate-release topiramate-treated adults was 1.5%, an incidence about 2 to 4 times greater than expected in a similar, untreated population. As in the general population, the incidence of stone formation among topiramate-treated patients was higher in men. Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking topiramate for epilepsy or migraine. During long-term (up to 1 year) topiramate treatment in an open-label extension study of 284 pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old with epilepsy, 7% developed kidney or bladder stones. Topiramate is not approved for treatment of epilepsy in pediatric patients less than 2 years old

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Topiramate is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and by increasing urinary pH

  </content>. The concomitant use of topiramate extended-release with any other drug producing metabolic acidosis, or potentially in patients on a ketogenic diet, may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of kidney stone formation, and should therefore be avoided.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Increased fluid intake increases the urinary output, lowering the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Hydration is recommended to reduce new stone formation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hypothermia, defined as a drop-in body core temperature to &lt;35°C (95°F), has been reported in association with topiramate use with concomitant valproic acid both in conjunction with hyperammonemia and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction in patients using concomitant topiramate and valproate can occur after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see
  
   <linkHtml href="#S7.1">Drug Interactions (7.1)</linkHtml>]
 
  </content>. Consideration should be given to stopping topiramate extended-release or valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.

                                    <paragraph>In pooled controlled clinical trials in adults with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 183 patients received adjunctive therapy with immediate-release topiramate at dosages of 200 to 400 mg/day (recommended dosage range) and 291 patients received placebo. Patients in these trials were receiving 1 to 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs in addition to immediate-release topiramate or placebo.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial that occurred in adult patients in the 200 to 400 mg/day topiramate group with an incidence higher (≥ 10%) than in the placebo group were: dizziness, speech disorders/related speech problems, somnolence, nervousness, psychomotor slowing, and vision abnormal (Table 6).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Table 6 presents the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of adult patients treated with 200 to 400 mg/day topiramate and was greater than placebo incidence. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., fatigue, dizziness, paresthesia, language problems, psychomotor slowing, depression, difficulty with concentration/attention, mood problems) was dose-related and much greater at higher than recommended topiramate dosing (i.e., 600 mg to 1000 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (200 mg to 400 mg daily) range.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>In four, fixed-dose, double-blind clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine in immediate-release topiramate-treated pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, the most common adverse reactions immediate-release topiramate 100 mg that were seen at an incidence higher (≥ 5%) than in the placebo group were: paresthesia, upper respiratory tract infection, anorexia, and abdominal pain (see

  </content>. Table 9 also shows adverse reactions in pediatric patients in the controlled migraine trials when the incidence in an immediate-release topiramate dose group was at least 5% or higher and greater than the incidence of placebo. Many adverse reactions shown in Table 9 indicate a dose-dependent relationship. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., allergy, fatigue, headache, anorexia, insomnia, somnolence, and viral infection) was dose-related and greater at higher than recommended immediate-release topiramate dosing (200 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dose (100 mg daily).

                              <paragraph>Topiramate is associated with an increased risk for bleeding. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled studies of approved and unapproved indications, bleeding was more frequently reported as an adverse reaction for topiramate than for placebo (4.5% versus 3.0% in adult patients, and 4.4% versus 2.3% in pediatric patients). In this analysis, the incidence of serious bleeding events for topiramate and placebo was 0.3% versus 0.2% for adult patients, and 0.4% versus 0% for pediatric patients.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Adverse bleeding reactions reported with topiramate ranged from mild epistaxis, ecchymosis, and increased menstrual bleeding to life-threatening hemorrhages. In patients with serious bleeding events, conditions that increased the risk for bleeding were often present, or patients were often taking drugs that cause thrombocytopenia (other antiepileptic drugs) or affect platelet function or coagulation (e.g., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or warfarin or other anticoagulants).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Topiramate extended-release can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Data from pregnancy registries indicate that infants exposed to topiramate
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in utero</content>have increased risk of major congenital malformations, including but not limited to cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), and of being small for gestational age (SGA)
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see
  
   <linkHtml href="#humandata">Human Data</linkHtml>]
 
  </content>. SGA has been observed at all doses and appears to be dose-dependent. The prevalence of SGA is greater in infants of women who received higher doses of topiramate during pregnancy. In addition, the prevalence of SGA in infants of women who continued topiramate use until later in pregnancy is higher compared to the prevalence in infants of women who stopped topiramate use before the third trimester.

                              <paragraph>In multiple animal species, topiramate demonstrated developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, in the absence of maternal toxicity at clinically relevant doses

Because of the risk of oral clefts to the fetus, which occur in the first trimester of pregnancy before many women know they are pregnant, all women of childbearing potential should be informed of the potential risk to the fetus from exposure to topiramate. Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks and benefits of topiramate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients.</paragraph>

The effect of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis has not been studied in pregnancy; however, metabolic acidosis in pregnancy (due to other causes) can cause decreased fetal growth, decreased fetal oxygenation, and fetal death, and may affect the fetus' ability to tolerate labor. Pregnant patients should be monitored for metabolic acidosis and treated as in the nonpregnant state

Other than oral clefts, no specific pattern of major congenital malformations or grouping of major congenital malformation types were observed. In the NAAED pregnancy registry, when topiramate-exposed infants with only oral clefts were excluded, the prevalence of major congenital malformations (4.1%) was higher than that in infants exposed to a reference AED (1.8%) or in infants with mothers without epilepsy and without exposure to AEDs (1.1%). The prevalence of oral clefts among topiramate-exposed infants (1.4%) was higher than the prevalence in infants exposed to a reference AED (0.3%) or the prevalence in infants with mothers without epilepsy and without exposure to AEDs (0.11%). It was also higher than the background prevalence in the United States (0.17%) as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The relative risk of oral clefts in topiramate-exposed pregnancies in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry was 12.5 (95% Confidence Interval=[CI] 5.9 to 26.37) as compared to the risk in a background population of untreated women. The UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register reported a prevalence of oral clefts among infants exposed to topiramate monotherapy (3.2%) that was 16 times higher than the background rate in the UK (0.2%).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Data from the NAAED pregnancy registry and a population-based birth registry cohort indicate that exposure to topiramate
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in utero</content>is associated with an increased risk of SGA newborns (birth weight &lt;10th percentile). In the NAAED pregnancy registry, 19.7% of topiramate-exposed newborns were SGA compared to 7.9% of newborns exposed to a reference AED, and 5.4% of newborns of mothers without epilepsy and without AED exposure. In the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN), a population-based pregnancy registry, 25% of newborns in the topiramate monotherapy exposure group were SGA compared to 9% in the comparison group who were unexposed to AEDs. The long-term consequences of the SGA findings are not known.

                                    <paragraph>When topiramate (0, 20, 100, or 500 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis, the incidence of fetal malformations (primarily craniofacial defects) were increased at all doses. Fetal body weights and skeletal ossification were reduced at the highest dose tested in conjunction with decreased maternal body weight gain. A no-effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in mice was not identified. The lowest dose tested, which was associated with an increased incidence of malformations, is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for epilepsy (400 mg/day) or migraine (100 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>) basis.

 </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In pregnant rats administered topiramate (0, 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg/day or 0, 0.2, 2.5, 30, and 400 mg/kg/day) orally during the period of organogenesis, the frequency of limb malformations (ectrodactyly, micromelia, and amelia) was increased in fetuses at 400 and 500 mg/kg/day. Embryotoxicity (reduced fetal body weights, increased incidences of structural variations) was observed at doses as low as 20 mg/kg/day. Clinical signs of maternal toxicity were seen at 400 mg/kg/day and above, and maternal body weight gain was reduced at doses of 100 mg/kg/day or greater. The no-effect dose (2.5 mg/kg/day) for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats is less than the MRHD for epilepsy or migraine on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis.

 </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In pregnant rabbits administered topiramate (0, 20, 60, and 180 mg/kg/day or 0, 10, 35, and 120 mg/kg/day) orally during organogenesis, embryofetal mortality was increased at 35 mg/kg/day and an increased incidence of fetal malformations (primarily rib and vertebral malformations) was observed at 120 mg/kg/day. Evidence of maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain, clinical signs, and/or mortality) was seen at 35 mg/kg/day and above. The no-effect dose (20 mg/kg/day) for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rabbits is equivalent to the MRHD for epilepsy and approximately 4 times the MRHD for migraine on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis.

 </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>When topiramate (0, 0.2, 4, 20, and 100 mg/kg/day or 0, 2, 20, and 200 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to female rats during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation, offspring exhibited decreased viability and delayed physical development at 200 mg/kg/day and reductions in pre- and/or postweaning body weight gain at 2 mg/kg/day and above. Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain, clinical signs) was evident at 100 mg/kg/day or greater. In a rat embryofetal development study which included postnatal assessment of offspring, oral administration of topiramate (0, 0.2, 2.5, 30, and 400 mg/kg/day) to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in delayed physical development in offspring at 400 mg/kg/day and persistent reductions in body weight gain in offspring at 30 mg/kg/day and higher. The no-effect dose (0.2 mg/kg/day) for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats is less than the MRHD for epilepsy or migraine on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis.

                              <paragraph>The following pediatric use information is based on studies conducted with immediate-release topiramate.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Safety and effectiveness in patients below the age of 2 years have not been established for the adjunctive therapy treatment of partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In a single randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigational trial, the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of immediate-release topiramate oral liquid and sprinkle formulations as an adjunct to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age with refractory partial-onset seizures were assessed. After 20 days of double-blind treatment, immediate-release topiramate (at fixed doses of 5, 15, and 25 mg/kg/day) did not demonstrate efficacy compared with placebo in controlling seizures.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In general, the adverse reaction profile for immediate-release topiramate in this population was similar to that of older pediatric patients, although results from the above controlled study and an open-label, long-term extension study in these pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old suggested some adverse reactions/toxicities not previously observed in older pediatric patients and adults; i.e., growth/length retardation, certain clinical laboratory abnormalities, and other adverse reactions/toxicities that occurred with a greater frequency and/or greater severity than had been recognized previously from studies in older pediatric patients or adults for various indications.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>These very young pediatric patients appeared to experience an increased risk for infections (any topiramate dose 12%, placebo 0%) and of respiratory disorders (any topiramate dose 40%, placebo 16%). The following adverse reactions were observed in at least 3% of patients on immediate-release topiramate and were 3% to 7% more frequent than in patients on placebo: viral infection, bronchitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, otitis media, upper respiratory infection, cough, and bronchospasm. A generally similar profile was observed in older pediatric patients

 </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Immediate-release topiramate resulted in an increased incidence of patients with increased creatinine (any topiramate dose 5%, placebo 0%), BUN (any topiramate dose 3%, placebo 0%), and protein (any topiramate dose 34%, placebo 6%), and an increased incidence of decreased potassium (any topiramate dose 7%, placebo 0%). This increased frequency of abnormal values was not dose-related. Creatinine was the only analyte showing a noteworthy increased incidence (topiramate 25 mg/kg/day 5%, placebo 0%) of a markedly abnormal increase

                              <paragraph>Immediate-release topiramate treatment also produced a dose-related increase in the percentage of patients who had a shift from normal at baseline to high/increased (above the normal reference range) in total eosinophil count at the end of treatment. The incidence of these abnormal shifts was 6% for placebo, 10% for 5 mg/kg/day, 9% for 15 mg/kg/day, 14% for 25 mg/kg/day, and 11% for any topiramate dose

                              <paragraph>In open-label, uncontrolled experience, increasing impairment of adaptive behavior was documented in behavioral testing over time in this population. There was a suggestion that this effect was dose-related. However, because of the absence of an appropriate control group, it is not known if this decrement in function was treatment related or reflects the patient's underlying disease (e.g., patients who received higher doses may have more severe underlying disease)

                              <paragraph>In this open-label, uncontrolled study, the mortality was 37 deaths/1,000 patient years. It is not possible to know whether this mortality rate is related to immediate-release topiramate treatment, because the background mortality rate for a similar, significantly refractory, young pediatric population (1 to 24 months) with partial epilepsy is not known.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>A one-year, active-controlled, open-label study with blinded assessments of bone mineral density (BMD) and growth in pediatric patients 4 to 15 years of age, including 63 patients with recent or new onset of epilepsy, was conducted to assess effects of immediate-release topiramate (N=28, 6 to 15 years of age) versus levetiracetam (N=35, 4 to 15 years of age) monotherapy on bone mineralization and on height and weight, which reflect growth. Effects on bone mineralization were evaluated via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and blood markers. Table 11 summarizes effects of immediate-release topiramate at 12 months for key safety outcomes including BMD, height, height velocity, and weight. All Least Square Mean values for immediate-release topiramate and the comparator were positive. Therefore, the Least Square Mean treatment differences shown reflect a topiramate induced attenuation of the key safety outcomes. Statistically significant effects were observed for decreases in BMD (and bone mineral content) in lumbar spine and total body less head and in weight. Subgroup analyses according to age demonstrated similar negative effects for all key safety outcomes (i.e., BMD, height, weight).</paragraph>

  </content>. Over the whole study, 76% more immediate-release topiramate-treated patients experienced persistent metabolic acidosis (i.e., 2 consecutive visits with or final serum bicarbonate &lt; 20 mEq/L) compared to levetiracetam-treated patients. Over the whole study, 35% more immediate-release topiramate-treated patients experienced a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value &lt; 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pre-treatment), indicating the frequency of more severe metabolic acidosis, compared to levetiracetam-treated patients. The decrease in BMD at 12 months was correlated with decreased serum bicarbonate, suggesting that metabolic acidosis was at least a partial factor contributing to this adverse effect on BMD.

                        <paragraph>The precise mechanisms by which topiramate exerts its anticonvulsant and preventive migraine effects are unknown; however, preclinical studies have revealed four properties that may contribute to topiramate's efficacy for epilepsy and the preventive treatment of migraine. Electrophysiological and biochemical evidence suggests that topiramate, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, augments the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate at some subtypes of the GABA-A receptor, antagonizes the AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor, and inhibits the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, particularly isozymes II and IV.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Topiramate has anticonvulsant activity in rat and mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) tests. Topiramate is only weakly effective in blocking clonic seizures induced by the GABA-A receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole. Topiramate is also effective in rodent models of epilepsy, which include tonic and absence-like seizures in the spontaneous epileptic rat (SER) and tonic and clonic seizures induced in rats by kindling of the amygdala or by global ischemia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Changes (increases and decreases) from baseline in vital signs (systolic blood pressure-SBP, diastolic blood pressure-DBP, pulse) occurred more frequently in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) treated with various daily doses of topiramate (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 2 to 3 mg/kg) than in patients treated with placebo in controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine. The most notable changes were SBP &lt; 90 mm Hg, DBP &lt; 50 mm Hg, SBP or DBP increases or decreases ≥ 20 mm Hg, and pulse increases or decreases ≥ 30 beats per minute. These changes were often dose-related and were most frequently associated with the greatest treatment difference at the 200 mg dose level. Systematic collection of orthostatic vital signs has not been conducted. The clinical significance of these various changes in vital signs has not been clearly established.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of topiramate extended-release are linear with dose proportional increases in plasma concentration when administered as a single oral dose over the range of 50 mg to 1,400 mg. At 25 mg, the pharmacokinetics of topiramate extended-release are nonlinear, possibly due to the binding of topiramate to carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Topiramate is not extensively metabolized and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine (approximately 70% of an administered dose). Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. The metabolites are formed via hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. There is evidence of renal tubular reabsorption of topiramate. In rats, given probenecid to inhibit tubular reabsorption, along with topiramate, a significant increase in renal clearance of topiramate was observed. This interaction has not been evaluated in humans. Overall, oral plasma clearance (CL/F) is approximately 20 mL/min to 30 mL/min in adults following oral administration. The mean effective half-life of topiramate extended-release is approximately 56 hours. Steady-state is reached in about 5 days after topiramate extended-release dosing in subjects with normal renal function.</paragraph>

Reflecting the primary renal elimination of topiramate, topiramate plasma and renal clearance were reduced 21% and 19%, respectively, in elderly subjects, compared to young adults. Similarly, topiramate half-life was longer (13%) in the elderly. Reduced topiramate clearance resulted in slightly higher maximum plasma concentration (23%) and AUC (25%) in elderly subjects than observed in young adults. Topiramate clearance is decreased in the elderly only to the extent that renal function is reduced

Patients received either no or a combination of other antiepileptic drugs. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed on the basis of pharmacokinetic data from relevant topiramate clinical studies. This dataset contained data from 1,217 subjects including 258 pediatric patients age 2 years to less than 16 years (95 pediatric patients less than 10 years of age).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Pediatric patients on adjunctive treatment exhibited a higher oral clearance (L/h) of topiramate compared to patients on monotherapy, presumably because of increased clearance from concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. In comparison, topiramate clearance per kg is greater in pediatric patients than in adults and in young pediatric patients (down to 2 years) than in older pediatric patients. Consequently, the plasma drug concentration for the same mg/kg/day dose would be lower in pediatric patients compared to adults and also in younger pediatric patients compared to older pediatric patients. Clearance was independent of dose.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers with a concomitantly administered combination oral contraceptive product containing 1 mg norethindrone (NET) plus 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE), topiramate, given in the absence of other medications at doses of 50 to 200 mg per day, was not associated with statistically significant changes in mean exposure (AUC) to either component of the oral contraceptive. In another study, exposure to EE was statistically significantly decreased at doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg per day (18%, 21%, and 30%, respectively) when given as adjunctive therapy in patients taking valproic acid. In both studies, topiramate (50 mg per day to 800 mg per day) did not significantly affect exposure to NET and there was no significant dose-dependent change in EE exposure for doses of 50 to 200 mg per day. The clinical significance of the changes observed is not known

The results of this study indicated that the mean metformin C

Oral plasma clearance of topiramate appears to be reduced when administered with metformin. The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on topiramate pharmacokinetics is unclear.

In a healthy volunteer, multiple-dose crossover study, the 90% CI for the ratios of AUC

  <sub>min</sub>, as well as partial AUC (the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time p (post dose)) for multiple time points were within the 80% to 125% bioequivalence limits, indicating no clinically significant difference between the two formulations. In addition, the 90% CI for the ratios of topiramate plasma concentration at each of multiple time points over 24 hours for the two formulations were within the 80% to 125% bioequivalence limits, except for the initial time points before 3 hours and at 8 hours post-dose, which is not expected to have a significant clinical impact.

                        <paragraph>The effects of switching between topiramate extended-release capsules and immediate-release topiramate were also evaluated in the same multiple-dose, crossover, comparative bioavailability study. In healthy subjects switched from immediate-release topiramate given every 12 hours to topiramate extended-release capsules given once daily, similar concentrations were maintained immediately after the formulation switch. On the first day following the switch, there were no significant differences in AUC
 
  <sub>0–24</sub>, C
 
  <sub>max</sub>, and C
 
  <sub>min</sub>, as the 90% CI for the ratios were contained within the 80% to 125% equivalence limits.

                              <paragraph>An increase in urinary bladder tumors was observed in mice given topiramate (0, 20, 75, and 300 mg/kg/day) in the diet for 21 months. An increase in the incidence of bladder tumors in males and females receiving 300 mg/kg/day was primarily due to the increased occurrence of a smooth muscle tumor considered histomorphologically unique to mice. The higher of the doses not associated with an increase in tumors (75 mg/kg/day) is equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for epilepsy (400 mg) and approximately 4 times the MRHD for migraine (100 mg) on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis. The relevance of this finding to human carcinogenic risk is uncertain.

                                    <paragraph>Study 1 was conducted in 487 patients diagnosed with epilepsy (6 to 83 years of age) who had 1 or 2 well-documented seizures during the 3-month retrospective baseline phase who then entered the study and received topiramate 25 mg/day for 7 days in an open-label fashion. Forty-nine percent of subjects had no prior AED treatment and 17% had a diagnosis of epilepsy for greater than 24 months. Any AED therapy used for temporary or emergency purposes was discontinued prior to randomization. In the double-blind phase, 470 patients were randomized to titrate up to 50 mg/day or 400 mg/day of topiramate. If the target dose could not be achieved, patients were maintained on the maximum tolerated dose. Fifty-eight percent of patients achieved the maximal dose of 400 mg/day for &gt;2 weeks, and patients who did not tolerate 150 mg/day were discontinued.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The primary efficacy assessment was a between-group comparison of time to first seizure during the double-blind phase. Comparison of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves of time to first seizure favored the topiramate 400 mg/day group over the topiramate 50 mg/day group (Figure 1). The treatment effects with respect to time to first seizure were consistent across various patient subgroups defined by age, sex, geographic region, baseline body weight, baseline seizure type, time since diagnosis, and baseline AED use.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>The conclusion that topiramate is effective as initial monotherapy in pediatric patients 2 to 9 years of age with partial-onset or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures was based on a pharmacometric bridging approach using data from the controlled epilepsy trials conducted with immediate-release topiramate described in labeling. This approach consisted of first showing a similar exposure-response relationship between pediatric patients down to 2 years of age and adults when immediate-release topiramate was given as adjunctive therapy. Similarity of exposure-response was also demonstrated in pediatric patients 6 to less than 16 years of age and adults when topiramate was given as initial monotherapy. Specific dosing in pediatric patients 2 to 9 years of age was derived from simulations utilizing plasma exposure ranges observed in pediatric and adult patients treated with immediate-release topiramate initial monotherapy

                              <paragraph>The effectiveness of topiramate as an adjunctive treatment for adults with partial-onset seizures was established in six multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), two comparing several dosages of topiramate and placebo and four comparing a single dosage with placebo, in patients with a history of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients in these studies were permitted a maximum of two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in addition to topiramate tablets or placebo. In each study, patients were stabilized on optimum dosages of their concomitant AEDs during baseline phase lasting between 4 and 12 weeks. Patients who experienced a pre-specified minimum number of partial onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, during the baseline phase (12 seizures for 12-week baseline, 8 for 8-week baseline or 3 for 4-week baseline) were randomly assigned to placebo or a specified dose of topiramate tablets in addition to their other AEDs.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Following randomization, patients began the double-blind phase of treatment. In five of the six studies, patients received active drug beginning at 100 mg per day; the dose was then increased by 100 mg or 200 mg/day increments weekly or every other week until the assigned dose was reached, unless intolerance prevented increases. In Study 7, the 25 or 50 mg/day initial doses of topiramate were followed by respective weekly increments of 25 or 50 mg/day until the target dose of 200 mg/day was reached. After titration, patients entered a 4, 8 or 12-week stabilization period. The numbers of patients randomized to each dose and the actual mean and median doses in the stabilization period are shown in Table 13.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Patients in Study 10 were permitted a maximum of two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in addition to topiramate or placebo. Patients who were experiencing at least 60 seizures per month before study entry were stabilized on optimum dosages of their concomitant AEDs during a 4-week baseline phase. Following baseline, patients were randomly assigned to placebo or topiramate in addition to their other AEDs. Active drug was titrated beginning at 1 mg/kg/day for a week; the dose was then increased to 3 mg/kg/day for one week, then to 6 mg/kg/day. After titration, patients entered an 8-week stabilization period. The primary measures of effectiveness were the percent reduction in drop attacks and a parental global rating of seizure severity.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In all adjunctive topiramate trials, the reduction in seizure rate from baseline during the entire double-blind phase was measured. The median percent reductions in seizure rates and the responder rates (fraction of patients with at least a 50% reduction) by treatment group for each study are shown below in Table 14. As described above, a global improvement in seizure severity was also assessed in the Lennox-Gastaut trial.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.4 Extended-Release: Adjunctive Therapy in Adult Patients with Partial-Onset Seizures with Topiramate</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of topiramate extended-release as an adjunctive treatment for adults (18 to 75 years of age) was evaluated in a randomized, international, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial in patients with a history of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization (Study 14).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with partial-onset seizures on a stable dose of 1 to 3 AEDs entered into an 8-week baseline period. Patients who experienced at least 8 partial onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, and no more than 21 consecutive seizure free days during the 8-week baseline phase were randomly assigned to placebo or topiramate extended-release administered once daily in addition to their concomitant AEDs. Following randomization, 249 patients began the double-blind treatment phase, which consisted of an initial 3-week titration period followed by an 8-week maintenance period. During the titration period, patients received topiramate extended-release or placebo beginning at 50 mg once daily; the dose was increased at weekly intervals by 50 mg once daily, or the placebo equivalent, until a final dose of 200 mg once daily was achieved. Patients then entered the maintenance period at the assigned dose of 200 mg once daily, or its placebo equivalent.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The percent reduction in the frequency of partial-onset seizure, baseline period compared to the treatment phase, was the primary endpoint. Data was analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with the criteria of statistical significance of p&lt;0.05. The results of the analysis are presented in Table 15. The median percent reduction in seizure rate was 39.5% in patients taking topiramate extended-release (N=124) and 21.7% in patients taking placebo (N=125). This difference was statistically significant.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials conducted in the US (Study 11) or the US and Canada (Study 12) established the effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day (twice the recommended daily dosage for the preventive treatment of migraine), or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by the reduction in migraine headache frequency, as measured by the change in 4-week migraine rate (according to migraines classified by IHS criteria) from the baseline phase to double-blind treatment period in each immediate-release topiramate treatment group compared to placebo in the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In Study 11, a total of 469 patients (416 females, 53 males), ranging in age from 13 to 70 years, were randomized and provided efficacy data. Two hundred sixty-five patients completed the entire 26-week double-blind phase. The median average daily dosages were 48 mg/day, 88 mg/day, and 132 mg/day in the target dose groups of topiramate 50, 100, and 200 mg/day, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The mean migraine headache frequency rate at baseline was approximately 5.5 migraine headaches per 28 days and was similar across treatment groups. The change in the mean 4-week migraine headache frequency from baseline to the double-blind phase was -1.3, -2.1, and -2.2 in the immediate-release topiramate 50, 100, and 200 mg/day groups, respectively, versus -0.8 in the placebo group (see
 
  <linkHtml href="#fig3">Figure 3</linkHtml>). The treatment differences between the immediate-release topiramate 100 and 200 mg/day groups versus placebo were similar and statistically significant (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons).

 </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In Study 12, a total of 468 patients (406 females, 62 males), ranging in age from 12 to 65 years, were randomized and provided efficacy data. Two hundred fifty-five patients completed the entire 26-week double-blind phase. The median average daily dosages were 47 mg/day, 86 mg/day, and 150 mg/day in the target dose groups of immediate-release topiramate 50, 100, and 200 mg/day, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The mean migraine headache frequency rate at baseline was approximately 5.5 migraine headaches per 28 days and was similar across treatment groups. The change in the mean 4-week migraine headache period frequency from baseline to the double-blind phase was -1.4, -2.1, and -2.4 in the immediate-release topiramate 50, 100, and 200 mg/day groups, respectively, versus -1.1 in the placebo group (see
 
  <linkHtml href="#fig3">Figure 3</linkHtml>). The differences between the immediate-release topiramate 100 and 200 mg/day groups versus placebo were similar and statistically significant (p=0.008 and p &lt;0.001, respectively).

 </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In both studies, there were no apparent differences in treatment effect within age or gender subgroups. Because most patients were Caucasian, there were insufficient numbers of patients from different races to make a meaningful comparison of race.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>For patients withdrawing from immediate-release topiramate, daily dosages were decreased in weekly intervals by 25 to 50 mg/day.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (Study 13). The study enrolled 103 patients (40 male, 63 female) 12 to 17 years of age with episodic migraine headaches with or without aura. Patient selection was based on IHS criteria for migraines (using proposed revisions to the 1988 IHS pediatric migraine criteria [IHS-R criteria]).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine attacks (according to migraines classified by patient reported diaries) and ≤14 headache days (migraine and non-migraine) during the 4-week prospective baseline period were randomized to either immediate-release topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 16 weeks (4-week titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily). Approximately 80% or more patients in each treatment group completed the study. The median average daily dosages were 45 and 79 mg/day in the target dose groups of immediate-release topiramate 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by comparing each immediate-release topiramate treatment group to placebo (ITT population) for the percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in the monthly migraine attack rate (primary endpoint). The percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly migraine attack rate is shown in Table 16. The 100 mg immediate-release topiramate dose produced a statistically significant treatment difference relative to placebo of 28% reduction from baseline in the monthly migraine attack rate.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The mean reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly attack rate, a key secondary efficacy endpoint in Study 13 (and the primary efficacy endpoint in Studies 11 and 12, of adults) was 3.0 for 100 mg immediate-release topiramate dose and 1.7 for placebo. This 1.3 treatment difference in mean reduction from baseline of monthly migraine rate was statistically significant (p = 0.0087).</paragraph>

Do not give topiramate extended-release capsules to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about topiramate extended-release capsules that is written for health professionals.
