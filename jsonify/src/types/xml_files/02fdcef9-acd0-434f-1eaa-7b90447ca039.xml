                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Ibandronate sodium tablets, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when ibandronate sodium tablets are given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization. Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronate sodium tablets and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6 to 8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#S2.2"> Dosage and Administration [2.2]</linkHtml>)</content>.  In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with ibandronate sodium tablets should be used under appropriate supervision.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="xmChange"/>Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including ibandronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="xmChange"/>For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="xmChange"/>Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment.</paragraph>

      5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture.<content styleCode="bold"> </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="bold"/>Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The safety of ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 – 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and the placebo group. Table 1 lists adverse reactions from the treatment and prevention studies reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and more frequently in patients treated daily with ibandronate sodium tablets than patients treated with placebo.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Reports in the medical literature indicate that bisphosphonates may be associated with ocular inflammation such as iritis and scleritis. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued. There were no reports of ocular inflammation in studies with ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The safety of ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg once monthly in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a two year trial which enrolled 1583 patients aged 54 to 81 years, with 395 patients exposed to ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily and 396 exposed to ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly. Patients with active or significant pre-existing gastrointestinal disease were excluded from this trial. Patients with dyspepsia or concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in this study. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>After one year, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.3% in both the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and the ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and 7% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse events was 9% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily group and 8% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg monthly group. <content styleCode="italics"> Table 2 </content>lists the adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients. </paragraph>

                           <br/>In female rats given ibandronate at oral doses greater than or equal to 3 times human exposure at the recommended daily oral dose of 2.5 mg or greater than or equal to 1 times human exposure at the recommended once-monthly oral dose of 150 mg beginning 14 days before mating and continuing through lactation, maternal deaths were observed at the time of delivery in all dose groups. Perinatal pup loss in dams given doses producing 45 times human exposure at the recommended daily dose and 13 times human exposure at the recommended once-monthly dose was likely related to maternal dystocia. Calcium supplementation did not completely prevent dystocia and periparturient mortality in any of the treated groups at greater than or equal to 16 times the recommended daily dose and greater than or equal to 4.6 times the recommended once-monthly dose. A low incidence of postimplantation loss was observed in rats treated from 14 days before mating throughout lactation or during gestation, only at doses causing maternal dystocia and periparturient mortality. In pregnant rats dosed orally from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21 (following closure of the hard palate through weaning), maternal toxicity, including dystocia and mortality, fetal perinatal and postnatal mortality, were observed at doses equivalent to human exposure at the recommended daily dose and greater than or equal to 4 times the recommended once-monthly dose. Periparturient mortality has also been observed with other bisphosphonates and appears to be a class effect related to inhibition of skeletal calcium mobilization resulting in hypocalcemia and dystocia. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Exposure of pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased fetal incidence of RPU (renal pelvis ureter) syndrome at oral doses producing 30 times human exposure at the recommended daily oral dose of 2.5 mg and greater than or equal to 9 times human exposure at the recommended once-monthly oral dose of 150 mg. Impaired pup neuromuscular development (cliff avoidance test) was observed at 45 times human exposure at the daily dose and 13 times the once-monthly dose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pregnant rabbits treated orally with ibandronate during gestation at doses greater than or equal to 8 times the recommended human daily oral dose of 2.5 mg and greater than or equal to 4 times the recommended human once-monthly oral dose of 150 mg, dose-related maternal mortality was observed in all treatment groups. The deaths occurred prior to parturition and were associated with lung edema and hemorrhage. No significant fetal anomalies were observed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Exposure multiples for the rat studies were calculated for the recommended daily oral dose of 2.5 mg or once-monthly dose of 150 mg based on area under the curve (AUC) comparison. Exposure multiples for the rabbit study were calculated for the recommended human daily oral dose of 2.5 mg or once-monthly dose of 150 mg based on dose/body surface area comparison. Doses used in pregnant animals were 1, 4, 5, 6, 16, 10, 20, 30, 60 or 100 mg/kg/day in rats, and 1, 4 or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Ibandronate sodium is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The drug substance used in ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg is ibandronate sodium in the form of propylene glycol solvate. The chemical name for ibandronate sodium propylene glycol solvate is monosodium  {1-hydroxy-3-[methyl(pentyl) amino]-1-phosphonopropyl} phosphonate propylene glycolate with the molecular formula C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>22</sub>NO<sub>7</sub>P<sub>2</sub>Na•C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and a molecular weight of  417.30. Ibandronate sodium propylene glycol solvate is a white to off-white powder. It is freely soluble in water and practically insoluble in organic solvents. Ibandronate sodium propylene glycol solvate has the following structural formula: </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The action of ibandronate on bone tissue is based
on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix
of bone. Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone
resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated
rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone
mass.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk, most commonly at the spine, hip, and wrist. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis indicative of vertebral fracture. While osteoporosis occurs in both men and women, it is most common among women following menopause. In healthy humans, bone formation and resorption are closely linked; old bone is resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone. In postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone resorption exceeds bone formation, leading to bone loss and increased risk of fracture. After menopause, the risk of fractures of the spine and hip increases; approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture during their remaining lifetimes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ibandronate sodium tablets produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases of biochemical markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked C-telopeptide of Type I collagen) in the daily dose range of 0.25 mg to 5 mg and once-monthly doses from 100 mg to 150 mg in postmenopausal women. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with 2.5 mg daily ibandronate sodium tablets resulted in decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover, including urinary C-terminal telopeptide of Type I collagen (uCTX) and serum osteocalcin, to levels similar to those in premenopausal women. Changes in markers of bone formation were observed later than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of bone resorption and formation. Treatment with 2.5 mg daily ibandronate sodium tablets decreased levels of uCTX within 1 month of starting treatment and decreased levels of osteocalcin within 3 months. Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of approximately 64% below baseline values by 6 months of treatment and remained stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years. Following treatment discontinuation, there is a return to pretreatment baseline rates of elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a 1-year, study comparing once-monthly vs. once-daily oral dosing regimens, the median decrease from baseline in serum CTX values was -76% for patients treated with the 150 mg once-monthly regimen and -67% for patients treated with the 2.5 mg daily regimen. In a 1-year, prevention study comparing ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg once-monthly to placebo, the median placebo-subtracted decrease in sCTX was -49.8%. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The absorption of oral ibandronate occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Plasma concentrations increase in a dose-linear manner up to 50 mg oral intake and increases nonlinearly above this dose. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Following oral dosing, the time to maximum observed plasma ibandronate concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in fasted healthy postmenopausal women. The mean oral bioavailability of 2.5 mg ibandronate was about 0.6% compared to intravenous dosing. The extent of absorption is impaired by food or beverages (other than plain water). The oral bioavailability of ibandronate is reduced by about 90% when ibandronate sodium tablets are administered concomitantly with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability observed in fasted subjects. There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability when ibandronate is taken at least 60 minutes before a meal. However, both bioavailability and the effect on bone mineral density (BMD) are reduced when food or beverages are taken less than 60 minutes following an ibandronate dose. </paragraph>

transport systems involved in the excretion of other drugs. There
is no evidence that ibandronate is metabolized in humans. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The portion of ibandronate that is not removed from
the circulation via bone absorption is eliminated unchanged by the
kidney (approximately 50% to 60% of the absorbed dose). Unabsorbed
ibandronate is eliminated unchanged in the feces.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The plasma elimination of ibandronate is multiphasic. Its renal clearance
and distribution into bone accounts for a rapid and early decline
in plasma concentrations, reaching 10% of the C<sub>max</sub> within
3 or 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration, respectively.
This is followed by a slower clearance phase as ibandronate redistributes
back into the blood from bone. The observed apparent terminal half-life
for ibandronate is generally dependent on the dose studied and on
assay sensitivity. The observed apparent terminal half-life for the
150 mg ibandronate tablet upon oral administration to healthy postmenopausal
women ranges from 37 to 157 hours. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Total clearance
of ibandronate is low, with average values in the range 84 to 160
mL/min. Renal clearance (about 60 mL/min in healthy postmenopausal
females) accounts for 50% to 60% of total clearance and is related
to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total
and renal clearances likely reflects bone uptake of the drug.</paragraph>

The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Animal studies have shown that ibandronate is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. In the Schenk assay in growing rats, ibandronate inhibited bone resorption and increased bone volume, based on histologic examination of the tibial metaphyses. There was no evidence of impaired mineralization at the highest dose of 5 mg/kg/day (subcutaneously), which is 1000 times the lowest antiresorptive dose of 0.005 mg/kg/day in this model, and 5000 times the optimal antiresorptive dose of 0.001 mg/kg/day in the aged ovariectomized rat. This indicates that ibandronate sodium tablets administered at therapeutic doses is unlikely to induce osteomalacia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Long-term daily or once-monthly intermittent administration of ibandronate to ovariectomized rats or monkeys was associated with suppression of bone turnover and increases in bone mass. In both rats and monkeys, vertebral BMD, trabecular density, and biomechanical strength were increased dose-dependently at doses up to 15 times the recommended human daily oral dose of 2.5 mg, or cumulative monthly doses up to 8 times (rat) or 6 times (monkey) the recommended human once-monthly oral dose of 150 mg, based on body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or area under the curve (AUC) comparison. In monkeys, ibandronate maintained the positive correlation between bone mass and strength at the ulna and femoral neck. New bone formed in the presence of ibandronate had normal histologic structure and did not show mineralization defects. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The effectiveness and safety of ibandronate sodium tablets were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study (Treatment Study) of 2946 women aged 55 to 80 years, who were on average 21 years postmenopause, who had lumbar spine BMD 2 to 5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one vertebra [L1 to L4], and who had 1 to 4 prevalent vertebral fractures. Ibandronate sodium tablets were evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures after 3 years of treatment. The diagnosis of an incident vertebral fracture was based on both qualitative diagnosis by the radiologist and quantitative morphometric criterion. The morphometric criterion required the dual occurrence of 2 events: a relative height ratio or relative height reduction in a vertebral body of at least 20%, together with at least a 4 mm absolute decrease in height. All women received 400 international units vitamin D and 500 mg calcium supplementation per day. </paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Ibandronate sodium tablets significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine and hip relative to treatment with placebo. In the 3-year osteoporosis treatment study, ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily produced increases in lumbar spine BMD that were progressive over 3 years of treatment and were statistically significant relative to placebo at 6 months and at all later time points. Lumbar spine BMD increased by 6.4% after 3 years of treatment with 2.5 mg daily ibandronate sodium tablets compared with 1.4% in the placebo group. <content styleCode="italics"> Table 4 </content>displays the significant increases in BMD seen at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter compared to placebo.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The effectiveness and safety of ibandronate sodium tablets once-monthly were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, multinational, noninferiority trial in 1602 women aged 54 to 81 years, who were on average 18 years postmenopause, and had L2 to L4 lumbar spine BMD T-score below -2.5 SD at baseline. The main outcome measure was the comparison of the percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD after 1 year of treatment with once-monthly ibandronate (100 mg, 150 mg) to daily ibandronate (2.5 mg). All patients received 400 international units vitamin D and 500 mg calcium supplementation per day. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Ibandronate sodium tablets 150 mg once-monthly (n=327) was shown to be noninferior to ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily (n=318) in lumbar spine BMD in a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In the primary efficacy analysis (per-protocol population), the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at 1 year were 3.86% (95% CI: 3.40%, 4.32%) in the 2.5 mg daily group and 4.85% (95% CI: 4.41%, 5.29%) in the 150 mg once-monthly group; the mean difference between 2.5 mg daily and 150 mg once-monthly was 0.99% (95% CI: 0.38%, 1.60%), which was statistically significant (p=0.002). The results of the intent-to-treat analysis were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis. The 150 mg once-monthly group also had consistently higher BMD increases at the other skeletal sites compared to the 2.5 mg daily group. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The safety and effectiveness of ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2-year study (Prevention Study) of 653 postmenopausal women without osteoporosis at baseline. Women were aged 41 to 82 years, were on average 8.5 years postmenopause, and had lumbar spine BMD T-scores greater than -2.5. Women were stratified according to time since menopause (1 to 3 years, greater than 3 years) and baseline lumbar spine BMD (T-score: greater than -1, -1 to -2.5). The study compared daily ibandronate sodium tablets at three dose levels (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 2.5 mg) with placebo. All women received 500 mg of supplemental calcium per day. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The primary efficacy measure was the change in BMD of lumbar spine after 2 years of treatment. Ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily resulted in a mean increase in lumbar spine BMD of 3.1% compared with placebo following 2 years of treatment. Increases in BMD were seen at 6 months and at all later time points. Irrespective of the time since menopause or the degree of pre-existing bone loss, treatment with ibandronate sodium tablets resulted in a higher BMD response at the lumbar spine compared with placebo across all four baseline strata [time since menopause (1 to 3 years, greater than 3 years) and baseline lumbar spine BMD (T-score: greater than -1, -1 to -2.5)].</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Compared with placebo, treatment with ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg daily increased BMD of the total hip by 1.8%, the femoral neck by 2.0%, and the trochanter by 2.1%.</paragraph>
