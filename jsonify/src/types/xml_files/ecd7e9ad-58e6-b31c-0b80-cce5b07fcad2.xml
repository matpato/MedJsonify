increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients
with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of ProHance among
these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and
not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated
NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney
disease (GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears
lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59
mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) and little, if any, for
patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis
affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis
of NSF following ProHance Multipack administration to Bracco Diagnostics
(1-800-257-5181) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or <content styleCode="underline">www.fda.gov/medwatch</content>).</paragraph>

for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal
function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours
to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly
in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced
kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not
reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury.
For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example,
age greater than 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension),
estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph ID="p58894321389216022">Among the factors that may increase the risk
for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and
the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the
specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients
at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended ProHance dose
and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug
prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians
may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration
of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent‚Äôs Page 4 elimination.

in several organs. The highest concentrations (nanomoles per gram
of tissue) have been identified in the bone, followed by other organs
(e.g. brain, skin, kidney, liver, and spleen). The duration of retention
also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more
retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. At equivalent doses, retention varies
among the linear agents with Omniscan (gadodiamide) and Optimark (gadoversetamide)
causing greater retention than other linear agents [Eovist (gadoxetate
disodium), Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine), MultiHance (gadobenate

The relatively large magnetic moment produced by the paramagnetic agent results in a relatively large local magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rates of water protons in the vicinity of the paramagnetic agent.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph ID="p31049321389217871">In MRI, visualization of normal and pathologic brain tissue depends, in part, on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with: 1) differences in proton density; 2) differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1); and 3) differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2). When placed in a magnetic field, gadoteridol decreases T1 relaxation times in the target tissues. At recommended doses, the effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in the T1-weighted sequences.</paragraph>

12% Hispanic, 2% Asian, and 2% other. ProHance was given in one single
0.1 mmol/kg dose. Repeat dosing was not studied. The results of the

Three independent, blinded readers evaluated pre-contrast MRI image
sets and paired pre-plus-post-contrast MRI image sets using ProHance
and rated the images according to three co-primary visualization endpoints:
lesion border delineation, visualization of lesion internal morphology,
and lesion contrast enhancement. All three blinded readers reported
improvement in the paired image sets for each of the three co-primary
