The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor. </paragraph>

The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN), JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, reactivation of hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV), SARS-CoV-2 infection, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including MPA derivatives mycophenolic acid and MMF. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of new or reactivated viral infections. Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease [see <content styleCode="italics">Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_6.3">6.1</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with MPA derivatives in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. The mechanism for MPA derivatives induced PRCA is unknown; the relative contribution of other immunosuppressants and their combinations in an immunosuppressive regimen is also unknown. In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of therapy with MPA derivatives. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk. Changes to mycophenolic acid therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients in order to minimize the risk of graft rejection. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients receiving mycophenolic acid should be monitored for blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia). The development of neutropenia may be related to mycophenolic acid itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these reactions. Complete blood count should be performed weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and the third month of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If blood dyscrasias occur [neutropenia develops (ANC less than 1.3 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mcL) or anemia], dosing with mycophenolic acid should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate tests performed, and the patient managed accordingly. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Acute inflammatory syndrome (AIS) has been reported with the use of mycophenolate products, and some cases have resulted in hospitalization. AIS is a paradoxical pro-inflammatory reaction characterized by fever, arthralgias, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated inflammatory markers including, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, without evidence of infection or underlying disease recurrence. Symptoms occur within weeks to months of initiation of treatment or a dose increase. After discontinuation, improvement of symptoms and inflammatory markers are usually<br/> observed within 24 to 48 hours.<br/> Monitor patients for symptoms and laboratory parameters of AIS when starting treatment with mycophenolate products or when increasing the dosage. Discontinue treatment and consider other treatment alternatives based on the risk and benefit for the patient.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Mycophenolic acid is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor (IMPDH inhibitor). Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT), such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout, such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, and renal disease, including renal failure. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/> The data described below derive from two randomized, comparative, active-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy trials in prevention of acute rejection in <content styleCode="italics">de novo </content>and converted stable kidney transplant patients.<br/> In the <content styleCode="italics">de novo </content>trial, patients were administered either mycophenolic acid 1.44 grams per day (N=213) or MMF 2 grams per day (N=210) within 48 hours post-transplant for 12 months in combination with cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED and corticosteroids. Forty-one percent of patients also received antibody therapy as induction treatment. In the conversion trial, renal transplant patients who were at least 6 months post-transplant and receiving 2 grams per day MMF in combination with cyclosporine USP MODIFIED, with or without corticosteroids for at least two weeks prior to entry in the trial were randomized to mycophenolic acid 1.44grams per day (N=159) or MMF 2 grams per day (N=163) for 12 months.<br/> The average age of patients in both studies was 47 years and 48 years (<content styleCode="italics">de novo</content> study and conversion study, respectively), ranging from 22 to 75 years. Approximately 66% of patients were male; 82% were white, 12% were black, and 6% other races. About 40% of patients were from the United States and 60% from other countries.<br/> In the <content styleCode="italics">de novo </content>trial, the overall incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 18% (39/213) and 17% (35/210) in the mycophenolic acid and MMF arms, respectively. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the mycophenolic acid arm were graft loss (2%), diarrhea (2%), vomiting (1%), renal impairment (1%), CMV infection (1%), and leukopenia (1%). The overall incidence of patients reporting dose reduction at least once during the 0- to 12-month study period was 59% and 60% in the mycophenolic acid and MMF arms, respectively. The most frequent reasons for dose reduction in the mycophenolic acid arm were adverse reactions (44%), dose reductions according to protocol guidelines (17%), dosing errors (11%) and missing data (2%).<br/> The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) associated with the administration of mycophenolic acid</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>were anemia, leukopenia, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, CMV infection, insomnia, and postoperative pain.<br/> The adverse reactions reported in ≥10% of patients in the de novo trial are presented in Table 2 below.</paragraph>

Both acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir and MPAG concentrations will be also increased in the presence of renal impairment.<br/>Acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/ valganciclovir may be taken with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets; however, during the period of treatment, physicians should monitor blood cell counts [see <content styleCode="italics">Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#Section_12.3">12.3</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora, such as ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid may interact with MMF by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are concomitantly administered with ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unclear; however, no dose adjustment of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are needed when coadministered with these drugs <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#Section_12.3">12.3</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to mycophenolate during pregnancy and those becoming pregnant within 6 weeks of discontinuing mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets treatment. To report a pregnancy or obtain information about the registry, visit www.mycophenolateREMS.com or call 1-800-617-8191.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following oral or intravenous (IV) administration, MMF is metabolized to mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active ingredient in mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and the active form of the drug. Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of multiple congenital malformations in multiple organ systems (see Human Data). Oral administration of mycophenolate to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced congenital malformations and pregnancy loss at doses less than the recommended clinical dose (0.05 and 1.1 times exposure at the recommended clinical doses in kidney transplant patients for rats and rabbits, respectively) (<content styleCode="italics">see Animal Data)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Risks and benefits of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be discussed with the patient. When appropriate, consider alternative immunosuppressants with less potential for embryo-fetal toxicity. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of pregnancy loss and congenital malformations in organ transplant populations is not clear. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A spectrum of congenital malformations (including multiple malformations in individual newborns) has been reported in 23% to 27% of live births in MMF exposed pregnancies, based on published data from pregnancy registries. Malformations that have been documented include external ear, eye, and other facial abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney, and nervous system. Based on published data from pregnancy registries, the risk of first trimester pregnancy loss has been reported at 45% to 49% following MMF exposure. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In animal reproductive toxicology studies, congenital malformations and pregnancy loss occurred when pregnant rats and rabbits received mycophenolate at dose multiples equivalent to and less than the recommended human dose. Oral administration of mycophenolate sodium to pregnant rats from Gestational Day 7 to Day 16 at a dose as low as 1 mg per kg resulted in malformations including anophthalmia, exencephaly, and umbilical hernia. The systemic exposure at this dose represents 0.05 times the clinical exposure at the human dose of 1,440 mg per day of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. Oral administration of mycophenolate to pregnant rabbits from Gestational Day 7 to Day 19 resulted in embryofetal lethality and malformations, including ectopia cordis, ectopic kidneys, diaphragmatic hernia, and umbilical hernia at doses equal to or greater than 80 mg per kg per day, in the absence of maternal toxicity. This corresponds to about 1.1 times the recommended clinical dose based on BSA.</paragraph>

Of the 372 patients treated with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets in the clinical trials, 6% (N=21) were 65 years of age and older and 0.3% (N=1) were 75 years of age and older. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>

                     <br/>There have been anecdotal reports of deliberate or accidental overdoses with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets, whereas not all patients experienced related adverse reactions.<br/>In those overdose cases in which adverse reactions were reported, the reactions fall within the known safety profile of the class. Accordingly, an overdose of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets could possibly result in oversuppression of the immune system and may increase the susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections, fatal infections and sepsis. If blood dyscrasias occur (e.g., neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count less than 1.5 x 10<sup>3</sup>/mcL or anemia), it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets.<br/>Possible signs and symptoms of acute overdose could include the following: hematological abnormalities, such as leukopenia and neutropenia, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and dyspepsia.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Treatment and Management </content> </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>General supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be followed in all cases of overdosage. Although dialysis may be used to remove the inactive metabolite mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG), it would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of the active moiety, mycophenolic acid, due to the 98% plasma protein binding of mycophenolic acid. By interfering with enterohepatic circulation of mycophenolic acid, activated charcoal or bile sequestrates, such as cholestyramine, may reduce the systemic mycophenolic acid exposure.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant, is an uncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and therefore inhibits the <content styleCode="italics">de novo </content>pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation to DNA. T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on <content styleCode="italics">de novo </content>synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways. MPA has cytostatic effects on lymphocytes.<br/>Mycophenolate sodium has been shown to prevent the occurrence of acute rejection in rat models of kidney and heart allotransplantation. Mycophenolate sodium also decreases antibody production in mice.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Mycophenolic acid exhibits linear and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics over the dose-range (360 mg to 2,160 mg) evaluated. The absolute bioavailability of mycophenolic acid in stable renal transplant patients on cyclosporine was 72%. MPA is highly protein bound (greater than 98% bound to albumin). The predominant metabolite of MPA is the phenolic glucuronide (MPAG) which is pharmacologically inactive. A minor metabolite AcMPAG which is an acyl glucuronide of MPAG is also formed and has pharmacological activity comparable to MPA. MPAG undergoes renal elimination. A fraction of MPAG also undergoes biliary excretion, followed by deconjugation by gut flora and subsequent reabsorption as MPA. The mean elimination half-lives of MPA and MPAG ranged between 8 and 16 hours, and 13 and 17 hours, respectively.<br/>

                           </content> <content styleCode="italics">In vitro </content>studies demonstrated that the enteric-coated mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets does not release MPA under acidic conditions (pH less than 5) as in the stomach but is highly soluble in neutral pH conditions as in the intestine. Following mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets oral administration without food in several pharmacokinetic studies conducted in renal transplant patients, consistent with its enteric-coated formulation, the median delay (T<sub>lag</sub>) in the rise of MPA concentration ranged between 0.25 and 1.25 hours and the median time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of MPA ranged between 1.5 and 2.75 hours. In comparison, following the administration of MMF, the median T<sub>max </sub>ranged between 0.5 and 1.0 hours. In stable renal transplant patients on cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED based immunosuppression, gastrointestinal absorption and absolute bioavailability of MPA following the administration of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets was 93% and 72%, respectively. Mycophenolic acid pharmacokinetics is dose proportional over the dose range of 360 mg to 2,160 mg.<br/>

                           </content> The mean (± SD) volume of distribution at steady state and elimination phase for MPA is 54 (± 25) L and 112 (± 48) L, respectively. MPA is highly protein bound to albumin, greater than 98%. The protein binding of MPAG is 82%. The free MPA concentration may increase under conditions of decreased protein binding (uremia, hepatic failure, and hypoalbuminemia).<br/>

                           </content> MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to glucuronidated metabolites. The phenolic glucuronide of MPA, MPAG, is the predominant metabolite of MPA and does not manifest pharmacological activity. The acyl glucuronide is a minor metabolite and has comparable pharmacological activity to MPA. In stable renal transplant patients on cyclosporine, USP MODIFIED based immunosuppression, approximately 28% of the oral mycophenolic acid dose was converted to MPAG by presystemic metabolism. The AUC ratio of MPA:MPAG:acyl glucuronide is approximately 1:24:0.28 at steady state. The mean clearance of MPA was 140 (± 30) mL/min.<br/>

                              <content styleCode="italics">Elimination</content>
                           </content> The majority of MPA dose administered is eliminated in the urine primarily as MPAG (greater than 60%) and approximately 3% as unchanged MPA following mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets administration to stable renal transplant patients. The mean renal clearance of MPAG was 15.5 (± 5.9) mL/min. MPAG is also secreted in the bile and available for deconjugation by gut flora. MPA resulting from the deconjugation may then be reabsorbed and produce a second peak of MPA approximately 6 to 8 hours after mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets dosing. The mean elimination half-life of MPA and MPAG ranged between 8 and 16 hours, and 13 and 17 hours, respectively.<br/>

                           </content> Compared to the fasting state, administration of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets 720 mg with a high-fat meal (55 g fat, 1000 calories) had no effect on the systemic exposure (AUC) of MPA. However, there was a 33% decrease in the maximal concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), a 3.5-hour delay in the T<sub>lag</sub> (range, -6 to 18 hours), and 5.0-hour delay in the T<sub>max</sub> (range, -9 to 20 hours) of MPA. To avoid the variability in MPA absorption between doses, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets should be taken on an empty stomach [see <content styleCode="italics">Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#Section_2.3">2.3</linkHtml>)</content>]<content styleCode="italics">.</content>

Single-dose mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets pharmacokinetics predicts multiple-dose pharmacokinetics. However, in the early post-transplant period, mean MPA AUC and C<sub>max </sub>were approximately one-half of those measured 6 months post-transplant. </paragraph>

However, based on studies of renal impairment with MMF, MPA exposure is not expected to be appreciably increased over the range of normal to severely impaired renal function following mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets administration.<br/>In contrast, MPAG exposure would be increased markedly with decreased renal function; MPAG exposure being approximately 8-fold higher in the setting of anuria. Although dialysis may be used to remove the inactive metabolite<br/>MPAG, it would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of the active moiety MPA. This is in large part due to the high plasma protein binding of MPA.<br/>

                           </content>No specific pharmacokinetic studies in individuals with hepatic impairment were conducted with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets. In a single dose (MMF 1,000 mg) trial of 18 volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis and 6 healthy volunteers, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes appeared to be relatively unaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease when the pharmacokinetic parameters of healthy volunteers and alcoholic cirrhosis patients within this trial were compared. However, it should be noted that for unexplained reasons, the healthy volunteers in this trial had about a 50% lower AUC compared to healthy volunteers in other studies, thus making comparison between volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis and healthy volunteers difficult. Effects of hepatic disease on this process probably depend on the particular disease. Hepatic disease, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, with other etiologies may show a different effect.<br/>

                           <br/> Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, as are ganciclovir concentrations, the two drugs will compete for tubular secretion and thus further increases in concentrations of both drugs may occur.

Approximately 50% reductions in median trough MPA concentrations (predose) from baseline (MMF alone) were observed in 3 days following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. These reductions in trough MPA concentrations tended to diminish within 14 days of antibiotic therapy and ceased within 3 days after discontinuation of antibiotics. The postulated mechanism for this interaction is an antibiotic-induced reduction in glucuronidase-possessing enteric organisms leading to a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. The change in trough level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure; therefore, clinical relevance of these observations is unclear [see <content styleCode="italics">Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_7.10">7.10</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in rats, mycophenolate sodium was not tumorigenic at daily doses up to 9 mg per kg, the highest dose tested. This dose resulted in approximately 0.6 to 1.2 times the systemic exposure (based on plasma AUC) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended dose of 1,440 mg per day. Similar results were observed in a parallel study in rats performed with MMF. In a 104-week oral carcinogenicity study in mice, MMF was not tumorigenic at a daily dose level as high as 180 mg per kg (which corresponds to 0.6 times the recommended mycophenolate sodium therapeutic dose, based on body surface area).<br/>The genotoxic potential of mycophenolate sodium was determined in five assays. Mycophenolate sodium was genotoxic in the mouse lymphoma/thymidine kinase assay, the micronucleus test in V79 Chinese hamster cells, and the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>mouse micronucleus assay. Mycophenolate sodium was not genotoxic in the bacterial mutation assay (<content styleCode="italics">Salmonella typhimurium </content>TA 1535, 97a, 98, 100, and 102) or the chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes.<br/>Mycophenolate mofetil generated similar genotoxic activity. The genotoxic activity of mycophenolic acid (MPA) is probably due to the depletion of the nucleotide pool required for DNA synthesis as a result of the pharmacodynamic mode of action of MPA (inhibition of nucleotide synthesis).<br/>Mycophenolate sodium had no effect on male rat fertility at daily oral doses as high as 18 mg per kg and exhibited no testicular or spermatogenic effects at daily oral doses of 20 mg per kg for 13 weeks (approximately 2 times the systemic exposure of MPA at the recommended therapeutic dose). No effects on female fertility were seen up to a daily dose of 20 mg per kg (approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of MPA at the recommended therapeutic dose).</paragraph>

Patients were excluded if they had 3 or more kidney transplants, multiorgan transplants (e.g., kidney and pancreas), previous organ transplants, evidence of graft rejection or who had been treated for acute rejection within 2 months prior to screening, clinically significant infections requiring continued therapy, presence of severe diarrhea, active peptic ulcer disease, or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.<br/>

Patients were randomized to mycophenolic acid 1.44 grams per day or MMF 2 grams per day for 12 months. The trial was conducted in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, and USA. Treatment failure was defined as the first occurrence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, death, or lost to follow-up at 6 and 12 months.</paragraph>

                        <br/>Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are a prescription medicine given to prevent rejection (antirejection medicine) in people who have received a kidney transplant. Rejection is when the body’s immune system senses the new organ as “foreign” and attacks it.<br/>Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are used with other medicines containing cyclosporine (Sandimmune<sup>®</sup>, Gengraf<sup>®</sup>, and Neoral<sup>®</sup>) and corticosteroids.<br/>Mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets can be used to prevent rejection in children who are 5 years or older and are stable after having a kidney transplant. It is not known if mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are safe and works in children younger than 5 years. It is not known how mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets works in children who have just received a new kidney transplant.<br/>
