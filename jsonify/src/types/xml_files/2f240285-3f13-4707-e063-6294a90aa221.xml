                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients receiving concomitant AEDs may be converted to monotherapy by initiating treatment with oxcarbazepine at 600 mg/day (given in a twice a day regimen) while simultaneously initiating the reduction of the dose of the concomitant AEDs. The concomitant AEDs should be completely withdrawn over 3 to 6 weeks, while the maximum dose of oxcarbazepine should be reached in about 2 to 4 weeks. Oxcarbazepine may be increased as clinically indicated by a maximum increment of 600 mg/day at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the maximum recommended daily dose of 2,400 mg/day. A daily dose of 1,200 mg/day has been shown in one study to be effective in patients in whom monotherapy has been initiated with oxcarbazepine. Patients should be observed closely during this transition phase.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients not currently being treated with AEDs may have monotherapy initiated with oxcarbazepine. In these patients, initiate oxcarbazepine at a dose of 600 mg/day (given a twice a day); the dose should be increased by 300 mg/day every third day to a dose of 1,200 mg/day. Controlled trials in these patients examined the effectiveness of a 1,200 mg/day dose; a dose of 2,400 mg/day has been shown to be effective in patients converted from other AEDs to oxcarbazepine monotherapy (see above).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In pediatric patients aged 4 to 16 years, initiate oxcarbazepine at a daily dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg generally not to exceed 600 mg/day, given twice a day. The target maintenance dose of oxcarbazepine should be achieved over 2 weeks, and is dependent upon patient weight, according to the following chart:</paragraph>

                           <item>20 to 29 kg - 900 mg/day</item>

                        <paragraph>In the clinical trial, in which the intention was to reach these target doses, the median daily dose was 31 mg/kg with a range of 6 to 51 mg/kg.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In pediatric patients aged 2 to &lt;4 years, initiate oxcarbazepine at a daily dose of 8 to 10 mg/kg generally not to exceed 600 mg/day, given twice a day. For patients less than 20 kg, a starting dose of 16 to 20 mg/kg may be considered

  </content>. The maximum maintenance dose of oxcarbazepine should be achieved over 2 to 4 weeks and should not exceed 60 mg/kg/day in a twice a day regimen.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>In the clinical trial in pediatric patients (2 to 4 years of age), in which the intention was to reach the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day, 50% of patients reached a final dose of at least 55 mg/kg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Under adjunctive therapy (with and without enzyme-inducing AEDs), when normalized by body weight, apparent clearance (L/hr/kg) decreased when age increased such that children 2 to &lt;4 years of age may require up to twice the oxcarbazepine dose per body weight compared to adults; and children 4 to ≤12 years of age may require a 50% higher oxcarbazepine dose per body weight compared to adults.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Dosage adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers or UGT inducers, which include certain AEDs

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients receiving concomitant AEDs may be converted to monotherapy by initiating treatment with oxcarbazepine at approximately 8 to 10 mg/kg/day given twice a day, while simultaneously initiating the reduction of the dose of the concomitant AEDs. The concomitant AEDs can be completely withdrawn over 3 to 6 weeks, while oxcarbazepine may be increased as clinically indicated by a maximum increment of 10 mg/kg/day at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended daily dose. Patients should be observed closely during this transition phase.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.1 Hyponatremia</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinically significant hyponatremia (sodium &lt;125 mmol/L) can develop during oxcarbazepine use. In the 14 controlled epilepsy studies, 2.5% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (38/1,524) had a sodium of less than 125 mmol/L at some point during treatment, compared to no such patients assigned placebo or active control (carbamazepine and phenobarbital for adjunctive and monotherapy substitution studies, and phenytoin and valproate for the monotherapy initiation studies). Clinically significant hyponatremia generally occurred during the first 3 months of treatment with oxcarbazepine, although there were patients who first developed a serum sodium &lt;125 mmol/L more than 1 year after initiation of therapy. Most patients who developed hyponatremia were asymptomatic, but patients in the clinical trials were frequently monitored and some had their oxcarbazepine dose reduced, discontinued, or had their fluid intake restricted for hyponatremia. Whether or not these maneuvers prevented the occurrence of more severe events is unknown. Cases of symptomatic hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have been reported during postmarketing use. In clinical trials, patients whose treatment with oxcarbazepine was discontinued due to hyponatremia generally experienced normalization of serum sodium within a few days without additional treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered for patients during maintenance treatment with oxcarbazepine, particularly if the patient is receiving other medications known to decrease serum sodium levels (e.g., drugs associated with inappropriate ADH secretion), or if symptoms possibly indicating hyponatremia develop (e.g., nausea, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, obtundation, or increase in seizure frequency or severity).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Approximately 25% to 30% of patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine will experience hypersensitivity reactions with oxcarbazepine. For this reason, patients should be specifically questioned about any prior experience with carbamazepine, and patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine should ordinarily be treated with oxcarbazepine only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity develop, oxcarbazepine should be discontinued immediately

                     <title>5.4 Serious Dermatological Reactions</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in both children and adults in association with oxcarbazepine use. Such serious skin reactions may be life threatening, and some patients have required hospitalization with very rare reports of fatal outcome. The median time of onset for reported cases was 19 days after treatment initiation. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with oxcarbazepine has also been reported.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <br/>  The reporting rate of TEN and SJS associated with oxcarbazepine use, which is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting, exceeds the background incidence rate estimates by a factor of 3- to 10-fold. Estimates of the background incidence rate for these serious skin reactions in the general population range between 0.5 to 6 cases per million-person years. Therefore, if a patient develops a skin reaction while taking oxcarbazepine, consideration should be given to discontinuing oxcarbazepine use and prescribing another antiepileptic medication.

                           <content styleCode="underline">Association With HLA-B*1502</content>
                           <br/>  Patients carrying the HLA-B*1502 allele may be at increased risk for SJS/TEN with oxcarbazepine treatment. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele B*1502 increases the risk for developing SJS/TEN in patients treated with carbamazepine. The chemical structure of oxcarbazepine is similar to that of carbamazepine. Available clinical evidence, and data from nonclinical studies showing a direct interaction between oxcarbazepine and HLA-B*1502 protein, suggest that the HLA-B*1502 allele may also increase the risk for SJS/TEN with oxcarbazepine. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  The frequency of HLA-B*1502 allele ranges from 2% to 12% in Han Chinese populations, is about 8% in Thai populations, and above 15% in the Philippines, and in some Malaysian populations. Allele frequencies up to about 2% and 6% have been reported in Korea and India, respectively. The frequency of the HLA-B*1502 allele is negligible in people from European descent, several African populations, indigenous peoples of the Americas, Hispanic populations, and in Japanese (&lt;1%). 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  Testing for the presence of the HLA-B*1502 allele should be considered in patients with ancestry in genetically at-risk populations, prior to initiating treatment with oxcarbazepine. The use of oxcarbazepine should be avoided in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Consideration should also be given to avoid the use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable. Screening is not generally recommended in patients from populations in which the prevalence of HLA-B* 1502 is low, or in current oxcarbazepine users, as the risk of SJS/TEN is largely confined to the first few months of therapy, regardless of HLA-B*1502 status. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations, and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as AED dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been well characterized.

                     <title>5.5 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Antiepileptic drugs, including oxcarbazepine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were 4 suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs, and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Use of oxcarbazepine has been associated with CNS-related adverse reactions. The most significant of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) cognitive symptoms, including psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration, and speech or language problems; 2) somnolence or fatigue; and 3) coordination abnormalities, including ataxia and gait disturbances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on oxcarbazepine to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In one large, fixed-dose study, oxcarbazepine was added to existing AED therapy (up to three concomitant AEDs). By protocol, the dosage of the concomitant AEDs could not be reduced as oxcarbazepine was added, reduction in oxcarbazepine dosage was not allowed if intolerance developed, and patients were discontinued if unable to tolerate their highest target maintenance doses. In this trial, 65% of patients were discontinued because they could not tolerate the 2,400 mg/day dose of oxcarbazepine on top of existing AEDs. The adverse events seen in this study were primarily CNS related and the risk for discontinuation was dose related.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>In this trial, 7.1% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 4% of placebo-treated patients experienced a cognitive adverse reaction. The risk of discontinuation for these events was about 6.5 times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo. In addition, 26% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 12% of placebo-treated patients experienced somnolence. The risk of discontinuation for somnolence was about 10 times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo. Finally, 28.7% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 6.4% of placebo-treated patients experienced ataxia or gait disturbances. The risk for discontinuation for these events was about 7 times greater on oxcarbazepine than on placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>In a single placebo-controlled monotherapy trial evaluating 2,400 mg/day of oxcarbazepine, no patients in either treatment group discontinued double-blind treatment because of cognitive adverse events, somnolence, ataxia, or gait disturbance.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>In the 2 dose-controlled conversion to monotherapy trials comparing 2,400 mg/day and 300 mg/day oxcarbazepine, 1.1% of patients in the 2,400 mg/day group discontinued double-blind treatment because of somnolence or cognitive adverse reactions compared to 0% in the 300 mg/day group. In these trials, no patients discontinued because of ataxia or gait disturbances in either treatment group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A study was conducted in pediatric patients (3 to 17 years old) with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures in which oxcarbazepine was added to existing AED therapy (up to 2 concomitant AEDs). By protocol, the dosage of concomitant AEDs could not be reduced as oxcarbazepine was added. Oxcarbazepine was titrated to reach a target dose ranging from 30 mg/kg to 46 mg/kg (based on a patient's body weight with fixed doses for predefined weight ranges).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Cognitive adverse events occurred in 5.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (the single most common event being concentration impairment, 4 of 138 patients) and in 3.1% of patients treated with placebo.  In addition, 34.8% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 14% of placebo-treated patients experienced somnolence (no patient discontinued due to a cognitive adverse reaction or somnolence). Finally, 23.2% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 7% of placebo-treated patients experienced ataxia or gait disturbances. Two (1.4%) oxcarbazepine-treated patients and 1 (0.8%) placebo-treated patient discontinued due to ataxia or gait disturbances.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.8 Drug Reaction With Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has occurred with oxcarbazepine. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Oxcarbazepine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.</paragraph>

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Due to physiological changes during pregnancy, plasma levels of the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine, the 10-monohydroxy derivative (MHD), may gradually decrease throughout pregnancy. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period because MHD levels may return after delivery.</paragraph>

Events common in the population, events reflecting chronic illness and events likely to reflect concomitant illness are omitted particularly if minor. They are listed in order of decreasing frequency. Because the reports cite events observed in open label and uncontrolled trials, the role of oxcarbazepine in their causation cannot be reliably determined.</paragraph>

Data on a limited number of pregnancies from pregnancy registries suggest that oxcarbazepine monotherapy use is associated with congenital malformations (e.g., craniofacial defects, such as oral clefts, and cardiac malformations, such as ventricular septal defects). Increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (embryolethality, growth retardation) were observed in the offspring of animals treated with either oxcarbazepine or its active 10-hydroxy metabolite (MHD) during pregnancy at doses similar to the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).</paragraph>

  <sup>2</sup>basis). Increased embryofetal death and decreased fetal body weights were seen at the high dose. Doses ≥300 mg/kg/day were also maternally toxic (decreased body weight gain, clinical signs), but there is no evidence to suggest that teratogenicity was secondary to the maternal effects.

                        <paragraph>In a study in which pregnant rabbits were orally administered MHD (0, 20, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) during organogenesis, embryofetal mortality was increased at the highest dose (1.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). This dose produced only minimal maternal toxicity.

                        <paragraph>In a study in which female rats were dosed orally with oxcarbazepine (0, 25, 50, or 150 mg/kg/day) during the latter part of gestation and throughout the lactation period, a persistent reduction in body weights and altered behavior (decreased activity) were observed in offspring exposed to the highest dose (less than the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis). Oral administration of MHD (0, 25, 75, or 250 mg/kg/day) to rats during gestation and lactation resulted in a persistent reduction in offspring weights at the highest dose (equivalent to the MRHD on a mg/m

Following administration of single (300 mg) and multiple (600 mg/day) doses of oxcarbazepine in elderly volunteers (60 to 82 years of age), the maximum plasma concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) values of MHD were 30% to 60% higher than in younger volunteers (18 to 32 years of age). Comparisons of creatinine clearance in young and elderly volunteers indicate that the difference was due to age-related reductions in creatinine clearance. Close monitoring of sodium levels is required in elderly patients at risk for hyponatremia

                        <paragraph>The pharmacological activity of oxcarbazepine is primarily exerted through the 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD) of oxcarbazepine

                           </content>]. The precise mechanism by which oxcarbazepine and MHD exert their anti-seizure effect is unknown; however,
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>electrophysiological studies indicate that they produce blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcited neural membranes, inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing, and diminution of propagation of synaptic impulses. These actions are thought to be important in the prevention of seizure spread in the intact brain. In addition, increased potassium conductance and modulation of high-voltage activated calcium channels may contribute to the anticonvulsant effects of the drug. No significant interactions of oxcarbazepine or MHD with brain neurotransmitter or modulator receptor sites have been demonstrated.

                        <paragraph>Oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite (MHD) exhibit anticonvulsant properties in animal seizure models. They protected rodents against electrically induced tonic extension seizures and, to a lesser degree, chemically induced clonic seizures, and abolished or reduced the frequency of chronically recurring focal seizures in Rhesus monkeys with aluminum implants. No development of tolerance (i.e., attenuation of anticonvulsive activity) was observed in the maximal electroshock test when mice and rats were treated daily for 5 days and 4 weeks, respectively, with oxcarbazepine or MHD.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following oral administration of oxcarbazepine tablets, oxcarbazepine is completely absorbed and extensively metabolized to its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD). In a mass balance study in people, only 2% of total radioactivity in plasma was due to unchanged oxcarbazepine, with approximately 70% present as MHD, and the remainder attributable to minor metabolites.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The half-life of the parent is about 2 hours, while the half-life of MHD is about 9 hours, so that MHD is responsible for most antiepileptic activity.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on MHD concentrations, oxcarbazepine tablets and suspension were shown to have similar bioavailability.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>After single-dose administration of oxcarbazepine tablets to healthy male volunteers under fasted conditions, the median t
 
  <sub>max</sub>was 4.5 (range, 3 to 13) hours.

                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Steady-state plasma concentrations of MHD are reached within 2 to 3 days in patients when oxcarbazepine is given twice a day. At steady state the pharmacokinetics of MHD are linear and show dose proportionality over the dose range of 300 to 2,400 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Food has no effect on the rate and extent of absorption of oxcarbazepine from oxcarbazepine tablets. Therefore, oxcarbazepine tablets can be taken with or without food.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 40% of MHD is bound to serum proteins, predominantly to albumin. Binding is independent of the serum concentration within the therapeutically relevant range. Oxcarbazepine and MHD do not bind to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxcarbazepine is rapidly reduced by cytosolic enzymes in the liver to its 10-monohydroxy metabolite, MHD, which is primarily responsible for the pharmacological effect of oxcarbazepine. MHD is metabolized further by conjugation with glucuronic acid. Minor amounts (4% of the dose) are oxidized to the pharmacologically inactive 10,11-dihydroxy metabolite (DHD).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Oxcarbazepine is cleared from the body mostly in the form of metabolites which are predominantly excreted by the kidneys. More than 95% of the dose appears in the urine, with less than 1% as unchanged oxcarbazepine. Fecal excretion accounts for less than 4% of the administered dose. Approximately 80% of the dose is excreted in the urine either as glucuronides of MHD (49%) or as unchanged MHD (27%); the inactive DHD accounts for approximately 3% and conjugates of MHD and oxcarbazepine account for 13% of the dose.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The half-life of the parent is about 2 hours, while the half-life of MHD is about 9 hours.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following administration of single (300 mg) and multiple (600 mg/day) doses of oxcarbazepine to elderly volunteers (60 to 82 years of age), the maximum plasma concentrations and AUC values of MHD were 30% to 60% higher than in younger volunteers (18 to 32 years of age). Comparisons of creatinine clearance in young and elderly volunteers indicate that the difference was due to age-related reductions in creatinine clearance.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Weight-adjusted MHD clearance decreases as age and weight increases, approaching that of adults. The mean weight-adjusted clearance in children 2 years to &lt;4 years of age is approximately 80% higher on average than that of adults.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Therefore, MHD exposure in these children is expected to be about one-half that of adults when treated with a similar weight-adjusted dose. The mean weight-adjusted clearance in children 4 to 12 years of age is approximately 40% higher on average than that of adults. Therefore, MHD exposure in these children is expected to be about three-quarters that of adults when treated with a similar weight-adjusted dose. As weight increases, for patients 13 years of age and above, the weight-adjusted MHD clearance is expected to reach that of adults.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A population PK analysis of oxcarbazepine was conducted that included n = 92 obese and non-obese pediatric patients &lt; 18 years of age to evaluate the potential impact of obesity on plasma oxcarbazepine exposures. Obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex based on CDC 2,000 growth chart recommendations. Simulated results from this analysis suggested that the target maintenance doses for oxcarbazepine, applied in pediatric patients ≥ 2 years of age, produced equivalent steady-state exposure of MHD between pediatric patients with and without obesity. This finding is consistent when using total body weight, or when using fat-free mass in patients ≥ 3 years and total body weight in patients &lt; 3 years in the simulations. Dosage adjustment according to obesity status is not necessary.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is a linear correlation between creatinine clearance and the renal clearance of MHD. When oxcarbazepine is administered as a single 300 mg dose in renally-impaired patients (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min), the elimination half-life of MHD is prolonged to 19 hours, with a 2-fold increase in AUC

                        <paragraph>Oxcarbazepine can inhibit CYP2C19 and induce CYP3A4/5 with potentially important effects on plasma concentrations of other drugs. In addition, several AEDs that are cytochrome P450 inducers can decrease plasma concentrations of oxcarbazepine and MHD. No autoinduction has been observed with oxcarbazepine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>Oxcarbazepine was evaluated in human liver microsomes to determine its capacity to inhibit the major cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of other drugs. Results demonstrate that oxcarbazepine and its pharmacologically active 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD) have little or no capacity to function as inhibitors for most of the human cytochrome P450 enzymes evaluated (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP4A9, and CYP4A11) with the exception of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Although inhibition of CYP3A4/5 by oxcarbazepine and MHD did occur at high concentrations, it is not likely to be of clinical significance. The inhibition of CYP2C19 by oxcarbazepine and MHD can cause increased plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of CYP2C19, which is clinically relevant.</paragraph>

Increases of 22% with MHD and 47% with oxcarbazepine were observed. As MHD, the predominant plasma substrate, is only a weak inducer of UDP-glucuronyl transferase, it is unlikely to have an effect on drugs that are mainly eliminated by conjugation through UDP-glucuronyl transferase (e.g., valproic acid, lamotrigine).

                        <paragraph>In 2-year carcinogenicity studies, oxcarbazepine was administered in the diet at doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day to mice and by gavage at doses of up to 250 mg/kg/day to rats, and the pharmacologically active 10-hydroxy metabolite (MHD) was administered orally at doses of up to 600 mg/kg/day to rats. In mice, a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas was observed at oxcarbazepine doses ≥70 mg/kg/day, which is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis. In rats, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was increased in females treated with oxcarbazepine at doses ≥ 25 mg/kg/day (less than the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis), and incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and/or carcinomas were increased in males and females treated with MHD at doses of 600 mg/kg/day (2.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis) and ≥250 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis), respectively. There was an increase in the incidence of benign testicular interstitial cell tumors in rats at 250 mg oxcarbazepine/kg/day and at ≥250 mg MHD/kg/day, and an increase in the incidence of granular cell tumors in the cervix and vagina in rats at 600 mg MHD/kg/day.

                     <title>14.1 Oxcarbazepine Monotherapy Trials</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Four randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter trials, conducted in a predominately adult population, demonstrated the efficacy of oxcarbazepine as monotherapy. Two trials compared oxcarbazepine to placebo and 2 trials used a randomized withdrawal design to compare a high dose (2,400 mg) with a low dose (300 mg) of oxcarbazepine, after substituting oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day for 1 or more AEDs. All doses were administered on a twice a day schedule. A fifth randomized, controlled, rater-blind, multicenter study, conducted in a pediatric  population, failed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between low-and high-dose oxcarbazepine -treatment groups.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <br/>  One placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 102 patients (11 to 62 years of age) with refractory partial-onset seizures who had completed an inpatient evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Patients had been withdrawn from all AEDs and were required to have 2 to 10 partial-onset seizures within 48 hours prior to randomization. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or oxcarbazepine given as 1,500 mg/day on Day 1 and 2,400 mg/day thereafter for an additional 9 days, or until 1 of the following 3 exit criteria occurred: 1) the occurrence of a fourth partial-onset seizure, excluding Day 1, 2) 2 new-onset secondarily generalized seizures, where such seizures were not seen in the 1-year period prior to randomization, or 3) occurrence of serial seizures or status epilepticus. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the time to meet exit criteria. There was a statistically significant difference in favor of oxcarbazepine (see Figure 1), p=0.0001.

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <br/>  The second placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 67 untreated patients (8 to 69 years of age) with newly-diagnosed and recent-onset partial seizures. Patients were randomized to placebo or oxcarbazepine, initiated at 300 mg twice a day and titrated to 1,200 mg/day (given as 600 mg twice a day) in 6 days, followed by maintenance treatment for 84 days. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the time to first seizure. The difference between the 2 treatments was statistically significant in favor of oxcarbazepine (see Figure 2), p=0.046.

                        <paragraph>
                           <br/>  A third trial substituted oxcarbazepine monotherapy at 2,400 mg/day for carbamazepine in 143 patients (12 to 65 years of age) whose partial-onset seizures were inadequately controlled on carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy at a stable dose of 800 to 1,600 mg/day, and maintained this oxcarbazepine dose for 56 days (baseline phase). Patients who were able to tolerate titration of oxcarbazepine to 2,400 mg/day during simultaneous carbamazepine withdrawal were randomly assigned to either 300 mg/day of oxcarbazepine or 2,400 mg/day oxcarbazepine. Patients were observed for 126 days or until 1 of the following 4 exit criteria occurred: 1) a doubling of the 28-day seizure frequency compared to baseline, 2) a 2-fold increase in the highest consecutive 2-day seizure frequency during baseline, 3) a single generalized seizure if none had occurred during baseline, or 4) a prolonged generalized seizure. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the time to meet exit criteria. The difference between the curves was statistically significant in favor of the oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day group (see Figure 3), p=0.0001.

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <br/>  Another monotherapy substitution trial was conducted in 87 patients (11 to 66 years of age) whose seizures were inadequately controlled on 1 or 2 AEDs. Patients were randomized to either oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day or 300 mg/day and their standard AED regimen(s) were eliminated over the first 6 weeks of double-blind therapy. Double-blind treatment continued for another 84 days (total double-blind treatment of 126 days) or until 1 of the 4 exit criteria described for the previous study occurred. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the percentage of patients meeting exit criteria. The results were statistically significant in favor of the oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day group (14/34; 41.2%) compared to the oxcarbazepine 300 mg/day group (42/45; 93.3%) (p&lt;0.0001). The time to meeting one of the exit criteria was also statistically significant in favor of the oxcarbazepine 2,400 mg/day group (see Figure 4), p=0.0001.

                        <paragraph/>
                        <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM5"/>
                        <paragraph>A monotherapy trial was conducted in 92 pediatric patients (1 month to 16 years of age) with inadequately-controlled or new-onset partial seizures. Patients were hospitalized and randomized to either oxcarbazepine 10 mg/kg/day or were titrated up to 40 to 60 mg/kg/day within 3 days while withdrawing the previous AED on the second day of oxcarbazepine. Seizures were recorded through continuous video-EEG monitoring from Day 3 to Day 5. Patients either completed the 5- day treatment or met 1 of the 2 exit criteria: 1) three study-specific seizures (i.e., electrographic partial-onset seizures with a behavioral correlate), 2) a prolonged study-specific seizure. The primary measure of effectiveness was a between-group comparison of the time to meet exit criteria in which the difference between the curves was not statistically significant (p=0.904). The majority of patients from both dose groups completed the 5-day study without exiting.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <br/>  Although this study failed to demonstrate an effect of oxcarbazepine as monotherapy in pediatric patients, several design elements, including the short treatment and assessment period, the absence of a true placebo, and the likely persistence of plasma levels of previously administered AEDs during the treatment period, make the results uninterpretable. For this reason, the results do not undermine the conclusion, based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerations, that oxcarbazepine is effective as monotherapy in pediatric patients 4 years old and older.

                     <title>14.2 Oxcarbazepine Adjunctive Therapy Trials</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of oxcarbazepine as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures was established in 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, one in 692 patients (15 to 66 years of age) and one in 264 pediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age), and in one multicenter, rater-blind, randomized, age-stratified, parallel-group study comparing 2 doses of oxcarbazepine in 128 pediatric patients (1 month to &lt;4 years of age). 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  Patients in the 2 placebo-controlled trials were on 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. In both of the trials, patients were stabilized on optimum dosages of their concomitant AEDs during an 8-week baseline phase. Patients who experienced at least 8 (minimum of 1 to 4 per month) partial-onset seizures during the baseline phase were randomly assigned to placebo or to a specific dose of oxcarbazepine in addition to their other AEDs. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  In these studies, the dose was increased over a 2-week period until either the assigned dose was reached, or intolerance prevented increases. Patients then entered a 14- (pediatrics) or 24-week (adults) maintenance period. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  In the adult trial, patients received fixed doses of 600, 1,200 or 2,400 mg/day. In the pediatric trial, patients received maintenance doses in the range of 30 to 46 mg/kg/day, depending on baseline weight. The primary measure of effectiveness in both trials was a between-group comparison of the percentage change in partial-onset seizure frequency in the double-blind treatment phase relative to baseline phase. This comparison was statistically significant in favor of oxcarbazepine at all doses tested in both trials (p=0.0001 for all doses for both trials). The number of patients randomized to each dose, the median baseline seizure rate, and the median percentage seizure rate reduction for each trial are shown in Table 8. It is important to note that in the high-dose group in the study in adults, over 65% of patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events; only 46 (27%) of the patients in this group completed the 28-week study

                           <br/>  Subset analyses of the antiepileptic efficacy of oxcarbazepine with regard to gender in these trials revealed no important differences in response between men and women. Because there were very few patients over the age of 65 years in controlled trials, the effect of the drug in the elderly has not been adequately assessed. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  The third adjunctive therapy trial enrolled 128 pediatric patients (1 month to &lt;4 years of age) with inadequately-controlled partial-onset seizures on 1 to 2 concomitant AEDs. Patients who experienced at least 2 study-specific seizures (i.e., electrographic partial-onset seizures with a behavioral correlate) during the 72-hour baseline period were randomly assigned to either oxcarbazepine 10 mg/kg/day or were titrated up to 60 mg/kg/day within 26 days. Patients were maintained on their randomized target dose for 9 days and seizures were recorded through continuous video-EEG monitoring during the last 72 hours of the maintenance period. The primary measure of effectiveness in this trial was a between-group comparison of the change in seizure frequency per 24 hours compared to the seizure frequency at baseline. For the entire group of patients enrolled, this comparison was statistically significant in favor of oxcarbazepine 60 mg/kg/day. In this study, there was no evidence that oxcarbazepine was effective in patients below the age of 2 years (N=75).
