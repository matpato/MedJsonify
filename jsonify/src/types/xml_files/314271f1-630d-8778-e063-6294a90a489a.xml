                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions, which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves, a sterile drape, and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad–spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry. If required, a sterile paracentesis needle should be available.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following intravitreal injection, patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (e.g., eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Each sterile vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. If the contralateral eye requires treatment, a new sterile vial should be used and the sterile field, syringe, gloves, drapes, eyelid speculum, filter, and injection needles should be changed before AHZANTIVE is administered to the other eye.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After injection, any unused product must be discarded.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intravitreal injections, including those with aflibercept products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] and, more rarely, retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering AHZANTIVE. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with aflibercept products [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including aflibercept products. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the aflibercept group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with aflibercept in the first six months of the RVO studies.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A total of 2980 adult patients treated with aflibercept constituted the safety population in eight phase 3 studies. Among those, 2379 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in &lt;0.1% of intravitreal injections with aflibercept including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Adequate and well-controlled studies with aflibercept have not been conducted in pregnant women. Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits, including external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects, systemic exposures (based on AUC for free aflibercept) were approximately 6 times higher than AUC values observed in humans after a single intravitreal treatment at the recommended clinical dose
  <br/>
[see Animal Data].
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether aflibercept  can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], treatment with aflibercept may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. AHZANTIVE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In two embryofetal development studies, aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects when administered every three days during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses ≥3 mg per kg, or every six days during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses ≥0.1 mg per kg.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Adverse embryofetal effects included increased incidences of postimplantation loss and fetal malformations, including anasarca, umbilical hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, cleft palate, ectrodactyly, intestinal atresia, spina bifida, encephalomeningocele, heart and major vessel defects, and skeletal malformations (fused vertebrae, sternebrae, and ribs; supernumerary vertebral arches and ribs; and incomplete ossification). The maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) in these studies was 3 mg per kg. Aflibercept produced fetal malformations at all doses assessed in rabbits and the fetal NOAEL was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits (0.1 mg per kg), systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept was approximately 6 times higher than systemic exposure (AUC) observed in adult patients after a single intravitreal dose of 2 mg.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells. VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, present on the surface of endothelial cells. PlGF binds only to VEGFR-1, which is also present on the surface of leucocytes. Activation of these receptors by VEGF-A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Aflibercept products act as soluble decoy receptors that bind VEGF-A and PlGF, and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Aflibercept is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. In patients with wet AMD, RVO, or DME, following intravitreal administration of aflibercept, a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept: VEGF complex. Once absorbed into the systemic circulation, aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept (unbound to VEGF) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF (i.e., aflibercept: VEGF complex).</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="italics">Absorption/Distribution</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of aflibercept to patients with wet AMD, RVO, and DME, the mean Cmax of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0.02 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.054 mcg/mL), 0.05 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.081 mcg/mL), and 0.03 mcg/mL (range: 0 to 0.076 mcg/mL), respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days. The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post-dosing in all patients. Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks. It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients, the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half-maximally bind systemic VEGF.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous (I.V.) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6L.</paragraph>

Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I.V. administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg aflibercept.</paragraph>

Similar results were seen in patients in a RVO study and in patients in a DME study. No dose adjustment based on renal impairment status is needed for either wet AMD, RVO, or DME patients.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of aflibercept or of other aflibercept products.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In the wet AMD, RVO, and DME studies, the pre-treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to aflibercept was approximately 1% to 3% across treatment groups. After dosing with aflibercept for 24-100 weeks, antibodies to aflibercept were detected in a similar percentage range of patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of afliberceptproducts . Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with intravenous administration of aflibercept at weekly doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg per kg.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. In addition, females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles. These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys (3 mg per kg) resulted in systemic exposure (AUC) for free aflibercept that was approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg. All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment.</paragraph>

At the NOAEL of 0.5 mg per eye in monkeys, the systemic exposure (AUC) was 56 times higher than the exposure observed in adult patients after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg.

                  <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, active-controlled studies in patients with wet AMD. A total of 2412 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (1817 with aflibercept) in the two studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2). In each study, up to week 52, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens: 1) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses (aflibercept 2Q8); 2) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (aflibercept 2Q4); 3) aflibercept 0.5 mg administered every 4 weeks (aflibercept 0.5Q4); and 4) ranibizumab administered 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4). Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28±3 days. Patient ages ranged from 49 to 99 years with a mean of 76 years.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision, defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 compared to baseline. Both aflibercept 2Q8 and aflibercept 2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to the ranibizumab 0.5 mg Q4 group in year 1.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Detailed results from the analysis of the VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies are shown in Table 4 and Figure 8 below.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies were both 96 weeks in duration. However after 52 weeks patients no longer followed a fixed dosing schedule. Between week 52 and week 96, patients continued to receive the drug and dosage strength to which they were initially randomized on a modified 12 week dosing schedule (doses at least every 12 weeks and additional doses as needed). Therefore, during the second year of these studies there was no active control comparison arm.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, sham-controlled studies in patients with macular edema following CRVO. A total of 358 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (217 with aflibercept) in the two studies (COPERNICUS and GALILEO). In both studies, patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to either 2 mg aflibercept administered every 4 weeks (2Q4), or sham injections (control group) administered every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28±7 days. Patient ages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA compared to baseline. At week 24, the aflibercept 2 mg Q4 group was superior to the control group for the primary endpoint.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in a 24-week, randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled study in patients with macular edema following BRVO. A total of 181 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy (91 with aflibercept) in the VIBRANT study. In the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 2 mg aflibercept administered every 4 weeks (2Q4) or laser photocoagulation administered at baseline and subsequently as needed (control group). Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28±7 days. Patient ages ranged from 42 to 94 years with a mean of 65 years.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In the VIBRANT study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline. At week 24, the aflibercept 2 mg Q4 group was superior to the control group for the primary endpoint.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of aflibercept were assessed in two randomized, multi-center, double-masked, controlled studies in patients with DME. A total of 862 randomized and treated patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28±7 days. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a mean of 63 years.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Of those, 576 were randomized to aflibercept groups in the two studies (VIVID and VISTA). In each study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens:
  <br/>
1) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections (aflibercept 2Q8); 2) aflibercept administered 2 mg every 4 weeks (aflibercept 2Q4); and 3) macular laser photocoagulation (at baseline and then as needed). Beginning at week 24, patients meeting a pre‑specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive additional treatment: patients in the aflibercept groups could receive laser and patients in the laser group could receive aflibercept.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In both studies, the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 52 as measured by ETDRS letter score. Efficacy of both aflibercept 2Q8 and aflibercept 2Q4 groups was statistically superior to the control group. This statistically superior improvement in BCVA was maintained at week 100 in both studies.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In the VIVID and VISTA studies, an efficacy outcome was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS). The ETDRS-DRSS score was assessed at baseline and approximately every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the studies [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies (77%) had moderate-to-severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) based on the ETDRS-DRSS. At week 100, the proportion of patients improving by at least 2 steps on the ETDRS-DRSS was significantly greater in both aflibercept treatment groups (2Q4 and 2Q8) when compared to the control group.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Results from the analysis of ETDRS-DRSS at week 100 in the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 8 below.</paragraph>

A total of 402 randomized patients were evaluable for efficacy. Protocol-specified visits occurred every 28±7 days for the first 5 visits, then every 8 weeks (56±7 days). Patient ages ranged from 25 to 85 years with a mean of 55.7 years.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens: 1) 3 initial monthly aflibercept 2 mg injections followed by one injection after 8 weeks and then one injection every 16 weeks (aflibercept 2Q16); 2) 5 monthly aflibercept 2 mg injections followed by one injection every 8 weeks (aflibercept 2Q8); and 3) sham treatment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved by ≥2 steps on the DRSS from baseline to week 24 in the combined aflibercept groups and at week 52 in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups individually versus sham. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing the composite endpoint of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or anterior segment neovascularization through week 52.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>At week 52, efficacy in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups was superior to the sham group (see Table 9 and Table 10). The proportion of patients with a ≥2-step improvement over time is shown in Figure 12.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>In the days following AHZANTIVE administration, patients are at risk of developing endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion. If the eye becomes red, sensitive to light, painful, or develops a change in vision, advise patients and/or caregivers to seek immediate care from an ophthalmologist [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients may experience temporary visual disturbances after an intravitreal injection with AHZANTIVE and the associated eye examinations [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Advise patients not to drive or use machinery until visual function has recovered sufficiently.</paragraph>
