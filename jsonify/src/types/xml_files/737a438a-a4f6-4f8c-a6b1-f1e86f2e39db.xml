                     <title>5.1 Permanent Vision Loss</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Vigabatrin can cause permanent vision loss. Because of this risk and because, when it is effective, vigabatrin provides an observable symptomatic benefit; patient response and continued need for treatment should be periodically assessed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Based upon adult studies, 30 percent or more of patients can be affected with bilateral concentric visual field constriction ranging in severity from mild to severe. Severe cases may be characterized by tunnel vision to within 10 degrees of visual fixation, which can result in disability. In some cases, vigabatrin also can damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity. Symptoms of vision loss from vigabatrin are unlikely to be recognized by patients or caregivers before vision loss is severe. Vision loss of milder severity, while often unrecognized by the patient or caregiver, can still adversely affect function.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because assessing vision may be difficult in infants and children, the frequency and extent of vision loss is poorly characterized in these patients. For this reason, the understanding of the risk is primarily based on the adult experience. The possibility that vision loss from vigabatrin may be more common, more severe, or have more severe functional consequences in infants and children than in adults cannot be excluded.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The onset of vision loss from vigabatrin is unpredictable and can occur within weeks of starting treatment or sooner, or at any time after starting treatment, even after months or years.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure, but there is no dose or exposure known to be free of risk of vision loss.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with refractory complex partial seizures, vigabatrin should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 3 months of initiating treatment. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 3 months, treatment should be discontinued at that time <content styleCode="italics">[seeÂ <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_230c1745-eb25-493c-89cf-3e0a82c15a72">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>Â </content>and <content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>In patients with infantile spasms, vigabatrin should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within 2 to 4 weeks. If, in the clinical judgment of the prescriber, evidence of treatment failure becomes obvious earlier than 2 to 4 weeks, treatment should be discontinued at that time <content styleCode="italics">[seeÂ <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_1e9dee6c-2f45-490d-a5cd-f526dcb1d573">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</linkHtml>Â </content>and <content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>Vigabatrin should not be used in patients with, or at high risk of, other types of irreversible vision loss unless the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the risks. The interaction of other types of irreversible vision damage with vision damage from vigabatrin has not been well-characterized, but is likely adverse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Vigabatrin should not be used with other drugs associated with serious adverse ophthalmic effects such as retinopathy or glaucoma unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Monitoring of Vision</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitoring of vision by an ophthalmic professional with expertise in visual field interpretation and the ability to perform dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy of the retina is recommended <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_454d1dd5-f2b9-4a7f-ab6f-5b154db78930">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. Because vision testing in infants is difficult, vision loss may not be detected until it is severe. For patients receiving vigabatrin, vision assessment is recommended at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting vigabatrin), at least every 3 months while on therapy, and about 3 to 6 months after the discontinuation of therapy. The diagnostic approach should be individualized for the patient and clinical situation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In adults and cooperative pediatric patients, perimetry is recommended, preferably by automated threshold visual field testing. Additional testing may also include electrophysiology (e.g., electroretinography [ERG]), retinal imaging (e.g., optical coherence tomography [OCT]), and/or other methods appropriate for the patient. In patients who cannot be tested, treatment may continue according to clinical judgment, with appropriate patient counseling. Because of variability, results from ophthalmic monitoring must be interpreted with caution, and repeat assessment is recommended if results are abnormal or uninterpretable. Repeat assessment in the first few weeks of treatment is recommended to establish if, and to what degree, reproducible results can be obtained, and to guide selection of appropriate ongoing monitoring for the patient.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The onset and progression of vision loss from vigabatrin is unpredictable, and it may occur or worsen precipitously between assessments. Once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not reversible. It is expected that even with frequent monitoring, some vigabatrin patients will develop severe vision loss. Consider drug discontinuation, balancing benefit and risk, if vision loss is documented. It is possible that vision loss can worsen despite discontinuation of vigabatrin.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Abnormalities in Infants</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Abnormal MRI signal changes characterized by increased T2 signal and restricted diffusion in a symmetric pattern involving the thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum have been observed in some infants treated with vigabatrin. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a retrospective epidemiologic study in infants with infantile spasms (N=205), the prevalence of MRI changes was 22% in vigabatrin-treated patients versus 4% in patients treated with other therapies. In this study, in post-marketing experience, and in published literature reports, these changes generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment. In a few patients, the lesion resolved despite continued use. It has been reported that some infants exhibited coincident motor abnormalities, but no causal relationship has been established and the potential for long-term clinical sequelae has not been adequately studied.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Neurotoxicity (brain histopathology and neurobehavioral abnormalities) was observed in rats exposed to vigabatrin during late gestation and the neonatal and juvenile periods of development, and brain histopathological changes were observed in dogs exposed to vigabatrin during the juvenile period of development. The relationship between these findings and the abnormal MRI findings in infants treated with vigabatrin for infantile spasms is unknown <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_735acb94-6e61-49c4-adec-936a3b8b0c24">Warnings and Precautions (5.4)</linkHtml>Â </content>andÂ <content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>The specific pattern of signal changes observed in patients 6 years and younger was not observed in older pediatric and adult patients treated with vigabatrin. In a blinded review of MRI images obtained in prospective clinical trials in patients with refractory complex partial seizures (CPS) 3 years and older (N=656), no difference was observed in anatomic distribution or prevalence of MRI signal changes between vigabatrin treated and placebo treated patients. In the post-marketing setting, MRI changes have also been reported in patients 6 years of age and younger being treated for refractory CPS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For adults treated with vigabatrin, routine MRI surveillance is unnecessary as there is no evidence that vigabatrin causes MRI changes in this population.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Vacuolation, characterized by fluid accumulation and separation of the outer layers of myelin, has been observed in brain white matter tracts in adult and juvenile rats and adult mice, dogs, and possibly monkeys following administration of vigabatrin. This lesion, referred to as intramyelinic edema (IME), was seen in animals at doses within the human therapeutic range. A no-effect dose was not established in rodents or dogs. In the rat and dog, vacuolation was reversible following discontinuation of vigabatrin treatment, but, in the rat, pathologic changes consisting of swollen or degenerating axons, mineralization, and gliosis were seen in brain areas in which vacuolation had been previously observed. Vacuolation in adult animals was correlated with alterations in MRI and changes in visual and somatosensory EP.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Administration of vigabatrin to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development produced vacuolar changes in the brain gray matter (including the thalamus, midbrain, deep cerebellar nuclei, substantia nigra, hippocampus, and forebrain) which are considered distinct from the IME observed in vigabatrin treated adult animals. Decreased myelination and evidence of oligodendrocyte injury were additional findings in the brains of vigabatrin-treated rats. An increase in apoptosis was seen in some brain regions following vigabatrin exposure during the early postnatal period. Long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities (convulsions,</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) were also observed following vigabatrin treatment of young rats. Administration of vigabatrin to juvenile dogs produced vacuolar changes in the brain gray matter (including the septal nuclei, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum, and globus pallidus). Neurobehavioral effects of vigabatrin were not assessed in the juvenile dog. These effects in young animals occurred at doses lower than those producing neurotoxicity in adult animals and were associated with plasma vigabatrin levels substantially lower than those achieved clinically in infants and children <content styleCode="italics">[seeÂ <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_17d7990d-8b85-4fa0-96c5-0cfae3030b2f">Use in Specific Populations (8.1</linkHtml>,Â <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_e6772885-daf1-4bb7-856f-4420cead1ee8">8.4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.5 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including vigabatrin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug treated patients in the trials and none in placebo treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>As with all AEDs, vigabatrin should be withdrawn gradually. However, if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse event, rapid discontinuation can be considered. Patients and caregivers should be told not to suddenly discontinue vigabatrin therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical studies in adults with complex partial seizures, vigabatrin was tapered by decreasing the daily dose 1,000 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a controlled study in pediatric patients with complex partial seizures, vigabatrin was tapered by decreasing the daily dose by one third every week for three weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a controlled clinical study in patients with infantile spasms, vigabatrin was tapered by decreasing the daily dose at a rate of 25 to 50 mg/kg every 3 to 4 days.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pooled data from two vigabatrin controlled trials in adults demonstrated that 24% (54/222) of vigabatrin patients experienced somnolence compared to 10% (14/135) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 28% of vigabatrin patients experienced fatigue compared to 15% (20/135) of placebo patients. Almost 1% of vigabatrin patients discontinued from clinical trials for somnolence and almost 1% discontinued for fatigue.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled data from three vigabatrin controlled trials in pediatric patients demonstrated that 6% (10/165) of vigabatrin patients experienced somnolence compared to 5% (5/104) of placebo patients. In those same studies, 10% (17/165) of vigabatrin patients experienced fatigue compared to 7% (7/104) of placebo patients. No vigabatrin patients discontinued from clinical trials due to somnolence or fatigue.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.9 Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Vigabatrin causes symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in adults. Pediatric clinical trials were not designed to assess symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, but observed incidence of symptoms based on pooled data from controlled pediatric studies appeared similar for pediatric patients on vigabatrin and placebo. In a pool of North American controlled and uncontrolled epilepsy studies, 4.2% (19/457) of vigabatrin patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the subset of North American placebo-controlled epilepsy trials, 1.4% (4/280) of vigabatrin treated patients and no (0/188) placebo patients developed signs and/or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Initial manifestations of peripheral neuropathy in these trials included, in some combination, symptoms of numbness or tingling in the toes or feet, signs of reduced distal lower limb vibration or position sensation, or progressive loss of reflexes, starting at the ankles. Clinical studies in the development program were not designed to investigate peripheral neuropathy systematically and did not include nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing, or skin or nerve biopsy. There is insufficient evidence to determine if development of these signs and symptoms was related to duration of vigabatrin treatment, cumulative dose, or if the findings of peripheral neuropathy were completely reversible upon discontinuation of vigabatrin.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Data pooled from randomized controlled trials in adults found that 17% (77/443) of vigabatrin patients versus 8% (22/275) of placebo patients gained â¥7% of baseline body weight. In these same trials, the mean weight change among vigabatrin patients was 3.5 kg compared to 1.6 kg for placebo patients.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In all epilepsy trials, 0.6% (31/4,855) of vigabatrin patients discontinued for weight gain. The long term effects of vigabatrin related weight gain are not known. Weight gain was not related to the occurrence of edema.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pooled data from controlled trials demonstrated increased risk among vigabatrin patients compared to placebo patients for peripheral edema (vigabatrin 2%, placebo 1%), and edema (vigabatrin 1%, placebo 0%). In these studies, one vigabatrin and no placebo patients discontinued for an edema related AE. In adults, there was no apparent association between edema and cardiovascular adverse events such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function.</paragraph>

In some patients, these enzymes become undetectable. The suppression of ALT and AST activity by vigabatrin may preclude the use of these markers, especially ALT, to detect early hepatic injury.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, including vigabatrin, during pregnancy. Encourage women who are taking vigabatrin during pregnancy to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 or visiting the website, http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. This must be done by the patient herself. </paragraph>

Limited available data from case reports and cohort studies pertaining to vigabatrin use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, based on animal data, vigabatrin use in pregnant women may result in fetal harm.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When administered to pregnant animals, vigabatrin produced developmental toxicity, including an increase in fetal malformations and offspring neurobehavioral and neurohistopathological effects, at clinically relevant doses. In addition, developmental neurotoxicity was observed in rats treated with vigabatrin during a period of postnatal development corresponding to the third trimester of human pregnancy <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_e2f02e16-8c01-4bc5-8206-e37ca8406e44">Data</linkHtml>)</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Administration of vigabatrin (oral doses of 50 to 200 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis was associated with an increased incidence of malformations (cleft palate) and embryo-fetal death; these findings were observed in two separate studies. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development in rabbits (100 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/2 the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3 g/day on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis. In rats, oral administration of vigabatrin (50, 100, or 150 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and increased incidences of fetal anatomic variations. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryo-fetal development in rats (50 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/5 the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup>Â basis. Oral administration of vigabatrin (50, 100, 150 mg/kg/day) to rats from the latter part of pregnancy through weaning produced long-term neurohistopathological (hippocampal vacuolation) and neurobehavioral (convulsions) abnormalities in the offspring. A no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats was not established; the low-effect dose (50 mg/kg/day) is approximately 1/5 the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup>Â basis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a published study, vigabatrin (300 or 450 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection to a mutant mouse strain on a single day during organogenesis (day 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12). An increase in fetal malformations (including cleft palate) was observed at both doses.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Oral administration of vigabatrin (5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day) to young rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development (postnatal days 4 to 65) produced neurobehavioral (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) and neurohistopathological (brain vacuolation, decreased myelination, and retinal dysplasia) abnormalities in treated animals. The early postnatal period in rats is generally thought to correspond to late pregnancy in humans in terms of brain development. The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in juvenile rats (5 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma vigabatrin exposures (AUC) less than 1/30 of those measured in pediatric patients receiving an oral dose of 50 mg/kg.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oral administration of vigabatrin (5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day) to young rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development (postnatal days 4 to 65) produced neurobehavioral (convulsions, neuromotor impairment, learning deficits) and neurohistopathological (brain gray matter vacuolation, decreased myelination, and retinal dysplasia) abnormalities. The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in juvenile rats (the lowest dose tested) was associated with plasma vigabatrin exposures (AUC) substantially less than those measured in pediatric patients at recommended doses. In dogs, oral administration of vigabatrin (30 or 100 mg/kg/day) during selected periods of juvenile development (postnatal days 22 to 112) produced neurohistopathological abnormalities (brain gray matter vacuolation). Neurobehavioral effects of vigabatrin were not assessed in the juvenile dog.

                        <paragraph>Clinical studies of vigabatrin did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Vigabatrin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of a single-dose of 1.5 g of vigabatrin to elderly (â¥65 years) patients with reduced creatinine clearance (&lt;50 mL/min) was associated with moderate to severe sedation and confusion in 4 of 5 patients, lasting up to 5 days. The renal clearance of vigabatrin was 36% lower in healthy elderly subjects (â¥65 years) than in young healthy males. Adjustment of dose or frequency of administration should be considered.

No vigabatrin overdoses resulted in death. When reported, the vigabatrin dose ingested ranged from 3 g to 90 g, but most were between 7.5 g and 30 g. Nearly half the cases involved multiple drug ingestions including carbamazepine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, lamotrigine, valproic acid, acetaminophen, and/or chlorpheniramine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Coma, unconsciousness, and/or drowsiness were described in the majority of cases of vigabatrin overdose. Other less commonly reported symptoms included vertigo, psychosis, apnea or respiratory depression, bradycardia, agitation, irritability, confusion, headache, hypotension, abnormal behavior, increased seizure activity, status epilepticus, and speech disorder. These symptoms resolved with supportive care. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism of vigabatrinâs anti-seizure effect is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of its action as an irreversible inhibitor of Î³-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. This action results in increased levels of GABA in the central nervous system. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No direct correlation between plasma concentration and efficacy has been established. The duration of drug effect is presumed to be dependent on the rate of enzyme re-synthesis rather than on the rate of elimination of the drug from the systemic circulation. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of vigabatrin in single doses up to 6 g. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 58 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of vigabatrin (3 g and 6 g) and placebo.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Vigabatrin displayed linear pharmacokinetics after administration of single doses ranging from 0.5 g to 4 g, and after administration of repeated doses of 0.5 g and 2 g twice daily. Bioequivalence has been established between the oral solution and tablet formulations. The following PK information (T<sub>max</sub>, half-life, and clearance) of vigabatrin was obtained from stand-alone PK studies and population PK analyses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following oral administration, vigabatrin is essentially completely absorbed. The time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) is approximately 1 hour for children and adolescents (3 years to 16 years of age) and adults, and approximately 2.5 hours for infants (5 months to 2 years of age). There was little accumulation with multiple dosing in adult and pediatric patients. A food effect study involving administration of vigabatrin to healthy volunteers under fasting and fed conditions indicated that the C<sub>max</sub> was decreased by 33%, T<sub>max</sub> was increased to 2 hours, and AUC was unchanged under fed conditions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Vigabatrin is not significantly metabolized; it is eliminated primarily through renal excretion. The terminal half-life of vigabatrin is about 5.7 hours for infants (5 months to 2 years of age), 6.8 hours for children (3 to 9 years of age), 9.5 hours for children and adolescents (10 to 16 years of age), and 10.5 hours for adults. Following administration of <sup>[14]</sup>C-vigabatrin to healthy male volunteers, about 95% of total radioactivity was recovered in the urine over 72 hours with the parent drug representing about 80% of this. Vigabatrin induces CYP2C9, but does not induce other hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of vigabatrin as adjunctive therapy in adult patients was established in two U.S. multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical studies. A total of 357 adults (age 18 to 60 years) with complex partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization were enrolled (Studies 1 and 2). Patients were required to be on an adequate and stable dose of an anticonvulsant, and have a history of failure on an adequate regimen of carbamazepine or phenytoin. Patients had a history of about 8 seizures per month (median) for about 20 years (median) prior to entrance into the study. These studies were not capable by design of demonstrating direct superiority of vigabatrin over any other anticonvulsant added to a regimen to which the patient had not adequately responded. Further, in these studies, patients had previously been treated with a limited range of anticonvulsants.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary measure of efficacy was the patientâs reduction in mean monthly frequency of complex partial seizures plus partial seizures secondarily generalized at end of study compared to baseline.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Study 1 (N=174) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study consisting of an 8-week baseline period followed by an 18-week treatment period. Patients were randomized to receive placebo or 1, 3, or 6 g/day vigabatrin administered twice daily. During the first 6 weeks following randomization, the dose was titrated upward beginning with 1 g/day and increasing by 0.5 g/day on days 1 and 5 of each subsequent week in the 3 g/day and 6 g/day groups, until the assigned dose was reached.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Results for the primary measure of effectiveness, reduction in monthly frequency of complex partial seizures, are shown in Table 8. The 3 g/day and 6 g/day dose groups were statistically significantly superior to placebo, but the 6 g/day dose was not superior to the 3 g/day dose.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Figure 1 presents the percentage of patients (X-axis) with a percent reduction in seizure frequency (responder rate) from baseline to the maintenance phase at least as great as that represented on the Y-axis. A positive value on the Y-axis indicates an improvement from baseline (i.e. a decrease in complex partial seizure frequency), while a negative value indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e. an increase in complex partial seizure frequency). Thus, in a display of this type, a curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in complex partial seizure frequency was consistently higher for the vigabatrin 3 and 6 g/day groups compared to the placebo group. For example, 51% of patients randomized to vigabatrin 3 g/day and 53% of patients randomized to vigabatrin 6 g/day experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, compared to 9% of patients randomized to placebo. Patients with an increase in seizure frequency &gt;100% are represented on the Y-axis as equal to or greater than -100%.<br/>

                        <paragraph>Figure 2 presents the percentage of patients (X-axis) with a percent reduction in seizure frequency (responder rate) from baseline to the maintenance phase at least as great as that represented on the Y-axis. A positive value on the Y-axis indicates an improvement from baseline (i.e. a decrease in complex partial seizure frequency), while a negative value indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e. an increase in complex partial seizure frequency). Thus, in a display of this type, a curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in seizure frequency was consistently higher for the vigabatrin 3 g/day group compared to the placebo group. For example, 39% of patients randomized to vigabatrin (3 g/day) experienced a 50% or greater reduction in complex partial seizure frequency, compared to 21% of patients randomized to placebo. Patients with an increase in seizure frequency &gt;100% are represented on the Y-axis as equal to or greater than -100%. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Vigabatrin was studied in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies in 269 patients who received vigabatrin and 104 patients who received placebo. No individual study was considered adequately powered to determine efficacy in pediatric patients age 3 years and above. The data from all three pediatric studies were pooled and used in a pharmacometric bridging analysis using weight-normalized doses to establish efficacy and determine appropriate dosing. All three studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, adjunctive-treatment studies in patients aged 3 to 16 years with uncontrolled complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. The study period included a 6 to 10 week baseline phase and a 14 to 17 week treatment phase (composed of a titration and maintenance period). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacometric bridging approach consisted of defining a weight-normalized dose-response, and showing that a similar dose-response relationship exists between pediatric patients and adult patients when vigabatrin was given as adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures. Dosing recommendations in pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age were derived from simulations utilizing these pharmacometric dose-response analyses <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_230c1745-eb25-493c-89cf-3e0a82c15a72">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of vigabatrin as monotherapy was established for infantile spasms in two multicenter controlled studies. Both studies were similar in terms of disease characteristics and prior treatments of patients and all enrolled infants had a confirmed diagnosis of infantile spasms. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Study 1 (N=221) was a multicenter, randomized, low-dose high-dose, parallel-group, partially-blind (caregivers knew the actual dose but not whether their child was classified as low or high dose; EEG reader was blinded but investigators were not blinded) study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vigabatrin in patients &lt;2 years of age with new-onset infantile spasms. Patients with both symptomatic and cryptogenic etiologies were studied. The study was comprised of two phases. The first phase was a 14 to 21 day partially-blind phase in which patients were randomized to receive either low-dose (18 to 36 mg/kg/day) or high-dose (100 to 148 mg/kg/day) vigabatrin. Study drug was titrated over 7 days, followed by a constant dose for 7 days. If the patient became spasm-free on or before day 14, another 7 days of constant dose was administered. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients who were spasm-free for 7 consecutive days beginning within the first 14 days of vigabatrin therapy. Patients considered spasm-free were defined as those patients who remained free of spasms (evaluated according to caregiver response to direct questioning regarding spasm frequency) and who had no indication of spasms or hypsarrhythmia during 8 hours of CCTV EEG recording (including at least one sleep-wake-sleep cycle) performed within 3 days of the seventh day of spasm freedom and interpreted by a blinded EEG reader. Seventeen patients in the high-dose group achieved spasm freedom compared with 8 patients in the low dose group. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.0375). Primary efficacy results are shown in Table 10.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Study 2 (N=40) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study consisting of a pre-treatment (baseline) period of 2 to 3 days, followed by a 5-day double-blind treatment phase during which patients were treated with vigabatrin (initial dose of 50 mg/kg/day with titration allowed to 150 mg/kg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the average percent change in daily spasm frequency, assessed during a pre-defined and consistent 2-hour window of evaluation, comparing baseline to the final 2 days of the 5-day double-blind treatment phase. No statistically significant differences were observed in the average frequency of spasms using the 2-hour evaluation window. However, a post-hoc alternative efficacy analysis, using a 24-hour clinical evaluation window found a statistically significant difference in the overall percentage of reductions in spasms between the vigabatrin group (68.9%) and the placebo group (17%) (p=0.030).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Duration of therapy for infantile spasms was evaluated in a post hoc analysis of a Canadian Pediatric Epilepsy Network (CPEN) study of developmental outcomes in infantile spasms patients. The 38/68 infants in the study who had responded to vigabatrin therapy (complete cessation of spasms and hypsarrhythmia) continued vigabatrin therapy for a total duration of 6 months therapy. The 38 infants who responded were then followed for an additional 18 months after discontinuation of vigabatrin to determine their clinical outcome. A post hoc analysis indicated no observed recurrence of infantile spasms in any of these 38 infants.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Monitoring of vision, including assessment of visual fields and visual acuity, is recommended at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting vigabatrin), at least every 3 months while on therapy, and about 3 to 6 months after discontinuation of therapy. In patients for whom vision testing is not possible, treatment may continue without recommended testing according to clinical judgment with appropriate patient or caregiver counseling. Patients or caregivers should be informed that if baseline or subsequent vision is not normal, vigabatrin should only be used if the benefits of vigabatrin treatment clearly outweigh the risks of additional vision loss.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Advise patients and caregivers that vision testing may be insensitive and may not detect vision loss before it is severe. Also advise patients and caregivers that if vision loss is documented, such loss is irreversible. Ensure that both of these points are understood by patients and caregivers.</paragraph>
