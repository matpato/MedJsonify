                        <paragraph>Deferasirox can cause acute kidney injury including renal failure requiring dialysis that has resulted in fatal outcomes. Based on postmarketing experience, most fatalities have occurred in patients with multiple comorbidities and who were in advanced stages of their hematological disorders. In the clinical trials, adult and pediatric deferasirox-treated patients with no preexisting renal disease experienced dose-dependent mild, non-progressive increases in serum creatinine and proteinuria. Preexisting renal disease and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in adult and pediatric patients. Acute illnesses associated with volume depletion and overchelation may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients, small decreases in eGFR can result in increases in deferasirox exposure, particularly in younger patients with body surface area typical of patients less than age 7 years. This can lead to a cycle of worsening renal function and further increases in deferasirox exposure, unless the dose is reduced or interrupted. Renal tubular toxicity, including acquired Fanconi syndrome, has been reported in patients treated with deferasirox, most commonly in pediatric patients with beta‑thalassemia and serum ferritin levels less than 1,500 mcg/L

                        <paragraph>Deferasirox can cause hepatic injury, fatal in some patients. In Study 1, 4 patients (1.3%) discontinued deferasirox because of hepatic toxicity (drug-induced hepatitis in 2 patients and increased serum transaminases in 2 additional patients). Hepatic toxicity appears to be more common in patients greater than 55 years of age. Hepatic failure was more common in patients with significant comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis and multi-organ failure
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (
  
   <linkHtml href="#s6p1">6.1</linkHtml>)]
 
  </content>. Acute liver injury and failure, including fatal outcomes, have occurred in pediatric deferasirox-treated patients. Liver failure occurred in association with acute kidney injury in pediatric patients at risk for overchelation during a volume depleting event. Interrupt deferasirox therapy when acute liver injury or acute kidney injury is suspected and during volume depletion. Monitor liver and renal function more frequently in pediatric patients who are receiving deferasirox in the 20 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day range and when iron burden is approaching normal. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden

                        <paragraph>GI hemorrhage, including deaths, has been reported in deferasirox-treated patients, especially in elderly patients who had advanced hematologic malignancies and/or low platelet counts. Nonfatal upper GI irritation, ulceration and hemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children and adolescents, receiving deferasirox

  </content>. Monitor for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and hemorrhage during deferasirox therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse reaction is suspected. The risk of GI hemorrhage may be increased when administering deferasirox in combination with drugs that have ulcerogenic or hemorrhagic potential, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, oral bisphosphonates, or anticoagulants. There have been reports of ulcers complicated with GI perforation (including fatal outcome)

These events were frequently associated with volume depletion or with continued deferasirox doses in the 20 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day range when body iron burden was approaching or in the normal range. Interrupt deferasirox in patients with volume depletion, and resume deferasirox when renal function and fluid volume have normalized. Monitor liver and renal function more frequently during volume depletion and in patients receiving deferasirox in the 20 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day range when iron burden is approaching the normal range. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden

                        <paragraph>For patients with transfusional iron overload, measure serum ferritin monthly to assess the patient’s response to therapy and minimize the risk of overchelation. An analysis of pediatric patients treated with deferasirox in pooled clinical trials (n = 158) found a higher rate of renal adverse reactions among patients receiving doses greater than 25 mg/kg/day while their serum ferritin values were less than 1,000 mcg/L. Consider dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and hepatic function, and serum ferritin levels during these periods. Use the minimum effective dose to maintain a low-iron burden

                        <paragraph>A total of 700 adult and pediatric patients were treated with deferasirox for 48 weeks in premarketing studies. These included 469 patients with beta-thalassemia, 99 with rare anemias, and 132 with sickle cell disease. Of these patients, 45% were male, 70% were Caucasian, and 292 patients were less than 16 years of age. In the sickle cell disease population, 89% of patients were black. Median treatment duration among the sickle cell patients was 51 weeks. Of the 700 patients treated, 469 (403 beta-thalassemia and 66 rare anemias) were entered into extensions of the original clinical protocols. In ongoing extension studies, median durations of treatment were 88 weeks to 205 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Six hundred twenty-seven (627) patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were enrolled across 5 uncontrolled trials. These studies varied in duration from 1 year to 5 years. The discontinuation rate across studies in the first year was 46% (adverse events 20%, withdrawal of consent 10%, death 8%, other 4%, lab abnormalities 3%, and lack of efficacy 1%). Among 47 patients enrolled in the study of 5-year duration, 10 remained on deferasirox at the completion of the study.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In Study 1, a total of 113 (38%) patients treated with deferasirox had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 separate occasions (Table 2) and 25 (8%) patients required dose reductions. Increases in serum creatinine appeared to be dose related [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In this study, 17 (6%) patients treated with deferasirox developed elevations in serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at 2 consecutive visits. Of these, 2 patients had liver biopsy proven drug-induced hepatitis and both discontinued deferasirox therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. An additional 2 patients, who did not have elevations in SGPT/ALT greater than 5 times the ULN, discontinued deferasirox because of increased SGPT/ALT. Increases in transaminases did not appear to be dose related. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuations included abnormal liver function tests (2 patients) and drug-induced hepatitis (2 patients), skin rash, glycosuria/proteinuria, Henoch Schönlein purpura, hyperactivity/insomnia, drug fever, and cataract (1 patient each).</paragraph>

  </content>. Of the patients who experienced creatinine increases in Study 3, 8 deferasirox-treated patients required dose reductions. In this study, 5 patients in the deferasirox group developed elevations in SGPT/ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN at 2 consecutive visits and 1 patient subsequently had deferasirox permanently discontinued. Four additional patients discontinued deferasirox due to adverse reactions with a suspected relationship to study drug, including diarrhea, pancreatitis associated with gallstones, atypical tuberculosis, and skin rash.

Tables 3 and 4 display the frequency of adverse reactions in patients with NTDT. Adverse reactions with a suspected relationship to study drug were included in Table 3 if they occurred at ≥ 5% of patients in Study 5.

                        <paragraph>A nested case control analysis was conducted within a deferasirox tablets for oral suspension pediatric pooled clinical trial dataset to evaluate the effects of dose and serum ferritin level, separately and combined, on kidney function. Among 1,213 children (aged 2 years to 15 years) with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, 162 cases of acute kidney injury (eGFR ≤ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 
  <sup>2</sup>) and 621 matched-controls with normal kidney function (eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m 
  <sup>2</sup>) were identified. The primary findings were:
 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>- A 26% increased risk of acute kidney injury was observed with each 5 mg/kg increase in daily deferasirox dosage starting at 20 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.48).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>- A 25% increased risk for acute kidney injury was observed with each 250 mcg/L decrease in serum ferritin starting at 1,250 mcg/L (95% CI: 1.01-1.56).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>- Among pediatric patients with a serum ferritin &lt; 1,000 mcg/L, those who received deferasirox dosage &gt; 30 mg/kg/day, compared to those who received lower dosages, had a higher risk for acute kidney injury (Odds ratio (OR) = 4.47, 95% CI: 1.25-15.95), consistent with overchelation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In addition, a cohort based analysis of ARs was conducted in the deferasirox tablets for oral suspension pediatric pooled clinical trial data. Pediatric patients who received deferasirox dose &gt; 25 mg/kg/day when their serum ferritin was &lt; 1,000 mcg/L (n = 158) had a 6-fold greater rate of renal adverse reactions (incidence rate ration (IRR) = 6.00, 95% CI: 1.75-21.36) and a 2-fold greater rate of dose interruptions (IRR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.33-3.17) compared to the time-period prior to meeting these simultaneous criteria. Adverse reaction of special interest (cytopenia, renal, hearing, and GI disorders) occurred 1.9‑fold more frequently when these simultaneous criteria were met, compared to preceding time‑periods (IRR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.05-3.48)

Of the 242 patients who had pre- and post‑baseline eGFR measurements, 116 (48%) patients had a decrease in eGFR of ≥ 33% observed at least once. Twenty-one (18%) of these 116 patients with decreased eGFR had a dose interruption, and 15 (13%) of these 116 patients had a dose decrease within 30 days. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation from the study included liver injury (n = 11), renal tubular disorder (n = 1), proteinuria (n = 1), hematuria (n = 1), upper GI hemorrhage (n = 1), vomiting (n = 2), abdominal pain (n = 1), and hypokalemia (n = 1).</paragraph>

An increase in theophylline plasma concentrations could lead to clinically significant theophylline-induced CNS or other adverse reactions. Avoid the concomitant use of theophylline or other CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tizanidine) with deferasirox. Monitor theophylline concentrations and consider theophylline dose modification if you must co-administer theophylline with deferasirox. Closely monitor patients for signs of exposure related toxicity when deferasirox is co-administered with other drugs metabolized by CYP1A2

                        <paragraph>Deferasirox is a substrate of UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. The concomitant use of deferasirox with potent UGT inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir) may result in a decrease in deferasirox efficacy due to a possible decrease in deferasirox concentration. Avoid the concomitant use of potent UGT inducers with deferasirox. Consider increasing the initial dose of deferasirox if you must co-administer these agents together

                        <paragraph>Administration of deferasirox to rats during pregnancy resulted in decreased offspring viability and an increase in renal anomalies in male offspring at doses that were about or less than the recommended human dose on a mg/m

                        <paragraph>Four hundred thirty-one (431) patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age were studied in clinical trials of deferasirox in the transfusional iron overload setting. Two hundred twenty-five (225) of these patients were between 65 years and 75 years of age while 206 were greater than or equal to 75 years of age. The majority of these patients had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 393). In these trials, elderly patients experienced a higher frequency of adverse reactions than younger patients. Monitor elderly patients for early signs or symptoms of adverse reactions that may require a dose adjustment. Elderly patients are at increased risk for toxicity due to the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In elderly patients, including those with MDS, individualize the decision to remove accumulated iron based on clinical circumstances and the anticipated clinical benefit and risks of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension therapy.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Cases of overdose (2 times to 3 times the prescribed dose for several weeks) have been reported. In one case, this resulted in hepatitis, which resolved without long-term consequences after a dose interruption. In one pediatric case, a dose of 2 times to 3 times the prescribed dose for 6 days, resulted in acute renal failure requiring hemofiltration and acute liver injury/failure, which were reversible with intensive care support. Single doses up to 80 mg per kg per day in iron overloaded beta-thalassemic patients have been tolerated with nausea and diarrhea noted. In healthy volunteers, single doses of up to 40 mg per kg per day were tolerated. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Early signs of acute overdose are digestive effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Hepatic and renal disorders have been reported, including cases of liver enzyme and creatinine increased with recovery after treatment discontinuation. An erroneously administered single dose of 90 mg/kg led to Fanconi syndrome which resolved after treatment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There is no specific antidote for deferasirox. In case of overdose, it may be treated with induction of vomiting or gastric lavage, and by symptomatic treatment.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Deferasirox is an orally active chelator that is selective for iron (as Fe
 
  <sup>3+</sup>). It is a tridentate ligand that binds iron with high affinity in a 2:1 ratio. Although deferasirox has very low affinity for zinc and copper there are variable decreases in the serum concentration of these trace metals after the administration of deferasirox. The clinical significance of these decreases is uncertain.

                        <paragraph>Pharmacodynamic effects tested in an iron balance metabolic study showed that deferasirox (10 mg per kg per day, 20 mg per kg per day, and 40 mg per kg per day) was able to induce a mean net iron excretion (0.119 mg Fe/kg, 0.329 mg Fe/kg, and 0.445 mg Fe/kg body weight per day, respectively) within the clinically relevant range (0.1 mg per kg per day to 0.5 mg per kg per day). Iron excretion was predominantly fecal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An analysis of pooled pediatric clinical trial data found a statistically significant relationship between exposure and the probability of renal toxicity (increase in serum creatinine and urinary protein), resulting in a decrease in renal function. Decreases in renal function resulted in an increase in deferasirox exposure, which may increase the probability of renal toxicity.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Deferasirox is absorbed following oral administration with median times to maximum plasma concentration (T
 
  <sub>max</sub>) of about 1.5 hours to 4 hours. The C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and area under the curve (AUC) of deferasirox increase approximately linearly with dose after both single administration and under steady-state conditions. Exposure to deferasirox increased by an accumulation factor of 1.3 to 2.3 after multiple doses. The absolute bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox tablets for oral suspension is 70% compared to an intravenous dose. The bioavailability (AUC) of deferasirox was variably increased when taken with a meal.

                        <paragraph>Deferasirox is highly (~99%) protein bound almost exclusively to serum albumin. The percentage of deferasirox confined to the blood cells was 5% in humans. The volume of distribution at steady state (V

                        <paragraph>Glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway for deferasirox, with subsequent biliary excretion. Deconjugation of glucuronidates in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) is likely to occur. Deferasirox is mainly glucuronidated by UGT1A1 and to a lesser extent UGT1A3. CYP450-catalyzed (oxidative) metabolism of deferasirox appears to be minor in humans (about 8%). Deconjugation of glucuronide metabolites in the intestine and subsequent reabsorption (enterohepatic recycling) was confirmed in a healthy volunteer study in which the administration of cholestyramine 12 g twice daily (strongly binds to deferasirox and its conjugates) 4 hours and 10 hours after a single dose of deferasirox resulted in a 45% decrease in deferasirox exposure (AUC) by interfering with the enterohepatic recycling of deferasirox.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The primary efficacy study, Study 1 (
 
  <linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00061750">NCT00061750</linkHtml>), was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, active‑comparator control study to compare deferasirox and deferoxamine in patients with beta‑thalassemia and transfusional hemosiderosis. Patients greater than or equal to 2 years of age were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral deferasirox at starting doses of 5 mg per kg, 10 mg per kg, 20 mg per kg, or 30 mg per kg once daily or subcutaneous deferoxamine at starting doses of 20 mg per kg to 60 mg per kg for at least 5 days per week based on LIC at baseline (2 to 3, greater than 3 to 7, greater than 7 to 14, and greater than 14 mg Fe/g dry weight). Patients randomized to deferoxamine who had LIC values less than 7 mg Fe/g dry weight were permitted to continue on their prior deferoxamine dose, even though the dose may have been higher than specified in the protocol.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients were to have a liver biopsy at baseline and end of study (after 12 months) for LIC. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as a reduction in LIC of greater than or equal to 3 mg Fe/g dry weight for baseline values greater than or equal to 10 mg Fe/g dry weight, reduction of baseline values between 7 and less than 10 to less than 7 mg Fe/g dry weight, or maintenance or reduction for baseline values less than 7 mg Fe/g dry weight.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A total of 586 patients were randomized and treated, 296 with deferasirox and 290 with deferoxamine. The mean age was 17.1 years (range, 2 years to 53 years); 52% were females and 88% were Caucasian. The primary efficacy population consisted of 553 patients (deferasirox n = 276; deferoxamine n = 277) who had LIC evaluated at baseline and 12 months or discontinued due to an adverse reaction. The percentage of patients achieving the primary endpoint was 52.9% for deferasirox and 66.4% for deferoxamine. The relative efficacy of deferasirox to deferoxamine cannot be determined from this study.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients who had an LIC at baseline and at end of study, the mean change in LIC was -2.4 mg Fe/g dry weight in patients treated with deferasirox and -2.9 mg Fe/g dry weight in patients treated with deferoxamine. Reduction of LIC and serum ferritin was observed with deferasirox doses of 20 mg per kg per day to 30 mg per kg per day. Deferasirox doses below 20 mg per kg per day failed to provide consistent lowering of LIC and serum ferritin levels (Figure 1). Therefore, a starting dose of 20 mg per kg per day is recommended

                  <paragraph>Study 2 (
 
  <linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00061763">NCT00061763</linkHtml>) was an open-label, noncomparative trial of efficacy and safety of deferasirox given for 1 year to patients with chronic anemias and transfusional hemosiderosis. Similar to Study 1, patients received 5 mg per kg per day, 10 mg per kg per day, 20 mg per kg per day, or 30 mg per kg per day of deferasirox based on baseline LIC.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph styleCode="CM33">A total of 184 patients were treated in this study: 85 patients with beta-thalassemia and 99 patients with other congenital or acquired anemias (myelodysplastic syndromes, n = 47; Diamond‑Blackfan syndrome, n = 30; other, n = 22). Nineteen percent (19%) of patients were less than 16 years of age and 16% were greater than 65 years of age. There was a reduction in the absolute LIC from baseline to end of study (‑4.2 mg Fe/g dry weight).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 3 (
 
  <linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00067080">NCT00067080</linkHtml>) was a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial of the safety and efficacy of deferasirox relative to deferoxamine given for 1 year in patients with sickle cell disease and transfusional hemosiderosis. Patients were randomized to deferasirox at doses of 5 mg per kg per day, 10 mg per kg per day, 20 mg per kg per day, or 30 mg per kg per day or subcutaneous deferoxamine at doses of 20 mg per kg per day to 60 mg per kg per day for 5 days per week according to baseline LIC.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A total of 195 patients were treated in this study: 132 with deferasirox and 63 with deferoxamine. Forty-four percent (44%) of patients were less than 16 years of age and 91% were black. At end of study, the mean change in LIC (as measured by magnetic susceptometry by a superconducting quantum interference device) in the per protocol-1 (PP-1) population, which consisted of patients who had at least 1 post-baseline LIC assessment, was -1.3 mg Fe/g dry weight for patients receiving deferasirox (n = 113) and ‑0.7 mg Fe/g dry weight for patients receiving deferoxamine (n = 54).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>One-hundred five (105) patients with thalassemia major and cardiac iron overload were enrolled in a study assessing the change in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2* value (measured in milliseconds, ms) before and after treatment with deferasirox. Cardiac T2* values at baseline ranged from 5 to less than 20 ms. The geometric mean of cardiac T2* in the 68 patients who completed 3 years of deferasirox therapy increased from 11.98 ms at baseline to 17.12 ms at 3 years. Cardiac T2* values improved in patients with severe cardiac iron overload (less than 10 ms) and in those with mild to moderate cardiac iron overload (greater than or equal to 10 to less than 20 ms). The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Six hundred twenty-seven (627) patients with MDS were enrolled across 5 uncontrolled trials. Two hundred thirty-nine (239) of the 627 patients were enrolled in trials that limited enrollment to patients with IPSS Low or Intermediate 1 risk MDS, and the remaining 388 patients were enrolled in trials that did not specify MDS risk stratification but required a life expectancy of greater than 1 year. Planned duration of treatment in these trials ranged from 1 year (365 patients) to 5 years (47 patients). These trials evaluated the effects of deferasirox therapy on parameters of iron overload, including LIC (125 patients) and serum ferritin (627 patients). The percent of patients completing planned duration of treatment was 51% in the largest 1-year study, 52% in the 3-year study and 22% in the 5-year study. The major causes for treatment discontinuation were withdrawal of consent, adverse reaction, and death. Over 1-year of follow-up across these pooled studies, mean change in serum ferritin was -332.8 (± 2615.59) mcg/L (n = 593) and mean change in LIC was -5.9 (± 8.32) mg Fe/g dw (n = 68). Results of these pooled studies in 627 patients with MDS suggest a progressive decrease in serum ferritin and LIC beyond 1-year in those patients who are able to continue deferasirox.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 4 (TELESTO;
 
  <linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00940602">NCT00940602</linkHtml>) was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in 225 patients with MDS (Low/Int-1 risk) and transfusional iron overload of which 149 were treated with deferasirox and 76 received placebo. The observed hazard ratio of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.96) suggests a positive impact of deferasirox on event-free survival (EFS, a composite endpoint defined as death, worsening cardiac function, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, liver function impairment, liver cirrhosis, or progression to acute myeloid leukemia, whichever occurred first).

                  <paragraph>Study 5 (
 
  <linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00873041">NCT00873041</linkHtml>) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with deferasirox for patients 10 years of age or older with NTDT syndromes and iron overload. Eligible patients had an LIC of at least 5 mg Fe/g dw measured by R2 MRI and a serum ferritin exceeding 300 mcg/L at screening (2 consecutive values at least 14 days apart from each other). A total of 166 patients were randomized, 55 to the deferasirox 5 mg/kg/day dose group, 55 to the deferasirox 10 mg/kg/day dose group, and 56 to placebo (28 to each matching placebo group). Doses could be increased after 6 months if the LIC exceeded 7 mg Fe/g dw and the LIC reduction from baseline was less than 15%. The patients enrolled included 89 males and 77 females. The underlying disease was beta-thalassemia intermedia in 95 (57%) patients, HbE beta-thalassemia in 49 (30%) patients, and alpha-thalassemia in 22 (13%) patients. There were 17 pediatric patients in the study. Caucasians comprised 57% of the study population and Asians comprised 42%. The median baseline LIC (range) for all patients was 12.1 (2.6-49.1) mg Fe/g dw. Follow-up was for 1- year. The primary efficacy endpoint of change in LIC from baseline to Week 52 was statistically significant in favor of both deferasirox dose groups compared with placebo (p ≤ 0.001) (Table 5). Furthermore, a statistically significant dose effect of deferasirox was observed in favor of the 10 mg/kg/day dose group (10 versus 5 mg/kg/day, p = 0.009). In a descriptive analysis, the target LIC (less than 5 mg Fe/g dw) was reached by 15 (27%) of 55 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day arm, 8 (15%) of 55 patients in the 5 mg/kg/day arm and 2 (4%) of 56 patients in the combined placebo groups.

                  <paragraph>Study 6 (
 
  <linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00873041">NCT00873041</linkHtml>) was an open-label trial of deferasirox for the treatment of patients previously enrolled on Study 5, including cross-over to active treatment for those previously treated with placebo. The starting dose of deferasirox in Study 6 was assigned based on the patient's LIC at completion of Study 5, being 20 mg/kg/day for an LIC exceeding 15 mg Fe/g dw, 10 mg/kg/day for LIC 3-15 mg Fe/g dw, and observation if the LIC was less than 3 mg Fe/g dw. Patients could continue on 5 mg/kg/day if they had previously exhibited at least a 30% reduction in LIC. Doses could be increased to a maximum of 20 mg/kg/day after 6 months if the LIC was more than 7 mg Fe/g dw and the LIC reduction from baseline was less than 15%. The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 6 was the proportion of patients achieving an LIC less than 5 mg Fe/g dw. A total of 133 patients were enrolled. Twenty patients began Study 6 with an LIC less than 5 mg Fe/g dw. Of the 113 patients with a baseline LIC of at least 5 mg Fe/g dw in Study 6, the target LIC (less than 5 mg Fe/g dw) was reached by 39 patients (35%). The responders included 4 (10%) of 39 patients treated at 20 mg/kg/day for a baseline LIC exceeding 15 mg Fe/g dw, and 31 (51%) of 61 patients treated at 10 mg/kg/day for a baseline LIC between 5 and 15 mg Fe/g dw. The absolute change in LIC at Week 52 by starting dose is shown in Table 5 below.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 7 (
 
  <linkHtml href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT01709838">NCT01709838</linkHtml>) was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, 5-year study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deferasirox in iron overloaded patients with NTDT of 10 years of age or older. All patients started treatment on 10 mg/kg/day deferasirox for four weeks. At Week 4, dose escalation was based on baseline LIC. At Week 24 and every 6 months thereafter, further dose adjustments were made according to the LIC at that visit. Treatment was interrupted when LIC &lt; 3 mg Fe/g dw or serum ferritin &lt; 300 ng/mL and was restarted at 10 mg/kg/day when LIC ≥ 5 mg Fe/g dw and serum ferritin ≥ 300 ng/mL. Throughout the study, the maximum dose of deferasirox given was 30 mg/kg/day.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A total of 134 patients were enrolled in the study. Eligible patients were required to have an LIC of at least 5 mg Fe/g dw measured by R2 MRI and a serum ferritin at least of 300 ng/mL at screening. The mean absolute change of LIC from Baseline to Week 52 was -6.7 mg Fe/g dw. The reduction in LIC was sustained until Week 260 (5 years) with the mean absolute change in LIC from Baseline to Week 260 of -10.6 mg Fe/g dw. In the subset of patients with Baseline LIC &gt; 15 mg Fe/g dw (49 patients), 51.0% achieved a first LIC &lt; 5 mg Fe/g dw (95% CI: 37.5, 64.4) with a median time of 28.6 months. In the subset of patients with target LIC of &lt; 3 mg Fe/g dw (61 patients), 39.3% developed first LIC ≥ 5 mg Fe/g dw in the follow-up period, with a median time of 13.9 months.</paragraph>
