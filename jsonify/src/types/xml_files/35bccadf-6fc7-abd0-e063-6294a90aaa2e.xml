                        <paragraph>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets combines glipizide and metformin hydrochloride, 2 antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action, to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Glipizide appears to lower blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs. The mechanism by which glipizide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established. In man, stimulation of insulin secretion by glipizide in response to a meal is undoubtedly of major importance. Fasting insulin levels are not elevated even on long-term glipizide administration, but the postprandial insulin response continues to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metformin hydrochloride is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin hydrochloride decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.</paragraph>

  <sup>®</sup>. Following administration of a single Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets 5 mg/500 mg tablet in healthy subjects with either a 20% glucose solution or a 20% glucose solution with food, there was a small effect of food on peak plasma concentration (C
 
  <sub>max</sub>) and no effect of food on area under the curve (AUC) of the glipizide component. Time to peak plasma concentration (T
 
  <sub>max</sub>) for the glipizide component was delayed 1 hour with food relative to the same tablet strength administered fasting with a 20% glucose solution. C
 
  <sub>max</sub>for the metformin component was reduced approximately 14% by food whereas AUC was not affected. T
 
  <sub>max</sub>for the metformin component was delayed 1 hour after food.

                        <paragraph>The absolute bioavailability of a 500 mg metformin hydrochloride tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablets of 500 mg and 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower peak concentration and a 25% lower AUC in plasma and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown.</paragraph>

Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &lt;1 μg/mL. During controlled clinical trials, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 μg/mL, even at maximum doses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The metabolism of glipizide is extensive and occurs mainly in the liver. The primary metabolites are inactive hydroxylation products and polar conjugates and are excreted mainly in the urine. Less than 10% unchanged glipizide is found in the urine. The half-life of elimination ranges from 2 to 4 hours in normal subjects, whether given intravenously or orally. The metabolic and excretory patterns are similar with the 2 routes of administration, indicating that first-pass metabolism is not significant.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance (see 
 
  <content styleCode="bold">Table 1</content>) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.

                        <paragraph>In the presence of normal renal function, there are no differences between single- or multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of metformin between patients with type 2 diabetes and normal subjects (see
 
  <content styleCode="bold">Table 1</content>), nor is there any accumulation of metformin in either group at usual clinical doses.

                        <paragraph>Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and Cmax is increased, when compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function (see

                        <paragraph>Increases above fasting glucose and insulin levels were determined at baseline and final study visits by measurement of plasma glucose and insulin for 3 hours following a standard mixed liquid meal. Treatment with Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets lowered the 3-hour postprandial glucose AUC, compared to baseline, to a significantly greater extent than did the glipizide and the metformin therapies. Compared to baseline, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets enhanced the postprandial insulin response, but did not significantly affect fasting insulin levels.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There were no clinically meaningful differences in changes from baseline for all lipid parameters between Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy and either metformin therapy or glipizide therapy.

                           <content styleCode="italics">Lactic Acidosis</content>—There have been post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (&gt; 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increases lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally &gt; 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets. In Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>•
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Renal Impairment</content>—The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patients renal function include (see

  <linkHtml href="#A4EBAE2CE-FAC8-45D5-B1FB-8868C26623D4">Clinical Pharmacology</linkHtml>):

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>o Before initiating Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>o Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  <sup>2</sup>. Initiation of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  <sup>2</sup>(See
 
  <linkHtml href="#A94FCEBAD-85BC-4CE8-8AA7-8B5601F72763">Contraindications</linkHtml>).

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>o Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>o In patients taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  <sup>2</sup>, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>•
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Drug interactions</content>—The concomitant use of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>•
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Age 65 or Greater</content>—The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>•
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Radiologic studies with contrast</content>—Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and lactic acidosis. Stop Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  <sup>2</sup>; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure, or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets if renal function is stable.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>•
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Surgery and other procedures</content>—Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>•
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Hypoxic states</content>—Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>•
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Excessive Alcohol intake</content>—Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, therefore, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>•
 
  <content styleCode="italics">Hepatic impairment</content>—Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are capable of producing hypoglycemia; therefore, proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions are important to avoid potential hypoglycemic episodes. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents or ethanol. Renal insufficiency may cause elevated drug levels of both glipizide and metformin hydrochloride. Hepatic insufficiency may increase drug levels of glipizide and may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of hypoglycemic reactions. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These drugs include thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid as compared to sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, some azoles, and other drugs that are highly protein-bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta adrenergic blocking agents. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, the patient should be observed closely for loss of blood glucose control.
 
  <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>binding studies with human serum proteins indicate that glipizide binds differently than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicylate or dicumarol. However, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical situation and in the use of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets with these drugs.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known. The effect of concomitant administration of fluconazole and glipizide has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled crossover study in normal volunteers. All subjects received glipizide alone and following treatment with 100 mg of fluconazole as a single oral daily dose for 7 days, the mean percent increase in the glipizide AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35% - 81%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC
 
  <sub>0-∞</sub>and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>of 12% and 13%, respectively, were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER. When glipizide ER was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glipizide AUC
 
  <sub>0-∞</sub>or C
 
  <sub>max</sub>, -4% and 0%, respectively. Therefore, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.

                        <paragraph>A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by coadministration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood C
 
  <sub>max</sub>by 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when coadministered chronically.

Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC.

                        <paragraph>Long-term carcinogenicity studies were performed with metformin alone in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human daily (MRHD) dose of 2000 mg of the metformin component of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin alone was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin alone in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day of metformin alone.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Recent information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities. Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose as close to normal as possible. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed. (See below.)</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets or its individual components.

                        <paragraph>Glipizide was found to be mildly fetotoxic in rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5-50 mg/kg). This fetotoxicity has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and tolazamide. The effect is perinatal and believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of glipizide. In studies in rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were found.</paragraph>

Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma. Similar studies have not been conducted in nursing mothers. Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (&gt;5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally &gt;5 mcg/mL [

                     <content styleCode="bold">The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (</content>

                     <content styleCode="bold">UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2½ times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of glipizide and of alternative modes of therapy.</content>

                  <paragraph>Overdosage of sulfonylureas, including glipizide, can produce hypoglycemia. Mild hypoglycemic symptoms, without loss of consciousness or neurological findings, should be treated aggressively with oral glucose and adjustments in drug dosage and/or meal patterns. Close monitoring should continue until the physician is assured that the patient is out of danger. Severe hypoglycemic reactions with coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment occur infrequently, but constitute medical emergencies requiring immediate hospitalization. If hypoglycemic coma is diagnosed or suspected, the patient should be given a rapid intravenous injection of concentrated (50%) glucose solution. This should be followed by a continuous infusion of a more dilute (10%) glucose solution at a rate that will maintain the blood glucose at a level above 100 mg/dL. Patients should be closely monitored for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours, since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery. Clearance of glipizide from plasma would be prolonged in persons with liver disease. Because of the extensive protein binding of glipizide, dialysis is unlikely to be of benefit.</paragraph>

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>With initial treatment and during dose titration, appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be used to determine the therapeutic response to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets and to identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, HbA
 
  <sub>1c</sub>should be measured at intervals of approximately 3 months to assess the effectiveness of therapy. The therapeutic goal in all patients with type 2 diabetes is to decrease FPG, PPG, and HbA
 
  <sub>1c</sub>to normal or as near normal as possible. Ideally, the response to therapy should be evaluated using HbA
 
  <sub>1c</sub>, which is a better indicator of long-term glycemic control than FPG alone.

                  <paragraph>No studies have been performed specifically examining the safety and efficacy of switching to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets therapy in patients taking concomitant glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) plus metformin.

Any change in therapy of type 2 diabetes should be undertaken with care and appropriate monitoring.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced. Therefore, Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.</paragraph>

In order to avoid hypoglycemia, the starting dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should not exceed the daily doses of glipizide or metformin already being taken. The daily dose should be titrated in increments of no more than 5 mg/500 mg up to the minimum effective dose to achieve adequate control of blood glucose or to a maximum dose of 20 mg/2000 mg per day.</paragraph>

The decision to switch to the nearest equivalent dose or to titrate should be based on clinical judgment. Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia following such a switch and the dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be titrated as described above to achieve adequate control of blood glucose.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are not recommended for use during pregnancy or for use in pediatric patients. The initial and maintenance dosing of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment requires a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. (See

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Your doctor has prescribed Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets to treat your type 2 diabetes. This is also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q2. What is type 2 diabetes?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>People with diabetes are not able to make enough insulin and/or respond normally to the insulin their body does make. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems, including kidney damage, amputations, and blindness. Diabetes is also closely linked to heart disease. The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q3. Why is it important to control type 2 diabetes?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level. Studies have shown that good control of blood sugar may prevent or delay complications such as heart disease, kidney disease, or blindness.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q4. How is type 2 diabetes usually controlled?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, a number of oral medications, and insulin injections. Before taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets you should first try to control your diabetes by exercise and weight loss. Even if you are taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, you should still exercise and follow the diet recommended for your diabetes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q5. Does Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets work differently from other glucose-control medications?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Yes, they do. Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets combines 2 glucose-lowering drugs, glipizide and metformin. These 2 drugs work together to improve the different metabolic defects found in type 2 diabetes. Glipizide lowers blood sugar primarily by causing more of the body's own insulin to be released, and metformin lowers blood sugar, in part, by helping your body use your own insulin more effectively. Together, they are efficient in helping you to achieve better glucose control.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Q6. What happens if my blood sugar is still too high?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When blood sugar cannot be lowered enough by Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, your doctor may prescribe injectable insulin or take other measures to control your diabetes.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Q7. Can Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets cause side effects?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, like all blood sugar-lowering medications, can cause side effects in some patients. Most of these side effects are minor. However, there are also serious, but rare, side effects related to Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets (see 
  <content styleCode="bold">Question Nos. 9 to 13</content>).

                     <content styleCode="bold">Q8. What are the most common side effects of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The most common side effects of Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets are normally minor ones such as diarrhea, nausea, and upset stomach. If these side effects occur, they usually occur during the first few weeks of therapy. Taking your Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets with meals can help reduce these side effects.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), such as lightheadedness, dizziness, shakiness, or hunger may occur. The risk of hypoglycemic symptoms increases when meals are skipped, too much alcohol is consumed, or heavy exercise occurs without enough food. Following the advice of your doctor can help you to avoid these symptoms.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Q9. Are there any serious side effects that Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets can cause?</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>People who have a condition known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and who take Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets may develop hemolytic anemia (fast breakdown of red blood cells). G6PD deficiency usually runs in families. Tell your doctor if you or any members of your family have been diagnosed with G6PD deficiency before you start taking Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets rarely causes serious side effects. Metformin , one of the medicine in Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets, can cause a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis (a buildup of aan acid in the blood) that can cause death. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in the hospital.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms, which could be signs of lactic acidosis:</paragraph>
                  <list listType="unordered" styleCode="Disc">
                     <item>you feel cold in your hands or feet</item>

                     <item>you have stomach pains, nausea or vomiting</item>
                  </list>
                  <paragraph>Most people who have had lactic acidosis with metformin have other things that, combined with the metformin, led to the lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following, because you have a higher chance for getting lactic acidosis with glipizide and metformin tabltes if you:</paragraph>
                  <list listType="unordered" styleCode="Disc">
                     <item>have severe kidney problems or your kidneys are affected by certain x-ray tests that use injectable dye.</item>

                     <item>have heart attack, severe infection, or stroke</item>
                  </list>
                  <paragraph>The best way to keep from having with lactic acidosis from metformin is to tell your doctor if you have any of the problems in the list above. Your doctor may decide to stop your Glipizide and Metformin HCl tablets for a while if you have any of these things.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Glipizide and Metformin HCl Tablets can have other serious side effects. See "
