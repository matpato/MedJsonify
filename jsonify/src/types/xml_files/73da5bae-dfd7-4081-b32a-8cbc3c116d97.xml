                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because of a risk for bradyarrhythmia and AV blocks, patients should be monitored during fingolimod treatment initiation <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_2.5">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml>].</content>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Reduction in Heart Rate</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>After the first dose of fingolimod, the heart rate decrease starts within an hour. On Day 1, the maximum decline in heart rate generally occurs within 6 hours and recovers, although not to baseline levels, by 8 to 10 hours postdose. Because of physiological diurnal variation, there is a second period of heart rate decrease within 24 hours after the first dose. In some patients, heart rate decrease during the second period is more pronounced than the decrease observed in the first 6 hours. Heart rates below 40 bpm in adults, and below 50 bpm in pediatric patientsÂ occurred rarely. In controlled clinical trials in adult patients, adverse reactions of symptomatic bradycardia following the first dose were reported in 0.6% of patients receiving fingolimod 0.5 mg and in 0.1% of patients on placebo. Patients who experienced bradycardia were generally asymptomatic, but some patients experienced hypotension, dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, and/or chest pain that usually resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment.<br/>
                           <br/> Patients with some preexisting conditions (e.g., ischemic heart disease, history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, history of symptomatic bradycardia, history of recurrent syncope, severe untreated sleep apnea, AV block, sinoatrial heart block) may poorly tolerate the fingolimod-induced bradycardia,Â orÂ experience serious rhythm disturbances after the first dose of fingolimod. Prior to treatment with fingolimod, these patients should have a cardiac evaluation by a physician appropriately trained to conduct such evaluation, and if treated with fingolimod, should be monitored overnight with continuous ECG in a medical facility after the first dose.<br/>
                           <br/> Since initiation of fingolimod treatment, results in decreased heart rate and may prolong the QT interval, patients with a prolonged QTc interval (&gt; 450 msec adult and pediatric males, &gt; 470 msec adult females, or &gt; 460 msec pediatric females) before dosing or during 6-hour observation,Â or at additional risk for QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, congenital long-QT syndrome), or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes (e.g., citalopram, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, methadone, erythromycin) should be monitored overnight with continuous ECG in a medical facility.<br/>
                           <br/> Following the second dose, a further decrease in heart rate may occur when compared to the heart rate prior to the second dose, but this change is of a smaller magnitude than that observed following the first dose. With continued dosing, the heart rate returns to baseline withinÂ 1 month of chronic treatment. Clinical data indicate effects of fingolimod on heart rate are maximal after the first dose although milder effects on heart rate may persist for, on average, 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy at which time heart rate generally returns to baseline. Physicians should continue to be alert to patient reports of cardiac symptoms.<br/>

                           <br/> Initiation of fingolimod treatment has resulted in transient AV conduction delays. In controlled clinical trials in adult patients, first-degree AV block after the first dose occurred in 4.7% of patients receiving fingolimod and 1.6% of patients on placebo. In a study of 697 patients with available 24-hour Holter monitoring data after their first dose (N = 351 receiving fingolimod and N = 346 on placebo), second-degree AV blocks (Mobitz Types I [Wenckebach] or 2:1 AV blocks) occurred in 4% (N = 14) of patients receiving fingolimod and 2% (N = 7) of patients on placebo. Of the 14 patients receiving fingolimod, 7 patients had 2:1 AV block (5 patients within the first 6 hours postdose and 2 patients after 6 hours postdose). All second-degree AV blocks on placebo were Mobitz Type I and occurred after the first 12 hours postdose. The conduction abnormalities were usually transient and asymptomatic, and resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment, but they occasionally required treatment with atropine or isoproterenol.<br/>

                        <paragraph>In the postmarketing setting, third-degree AV block and AV block with junctional escape have been observed during the first-dose 6-hour observation period with fingolimod. Isolated delayed onset events, including transient asystole and unexplained death, have occurred within 24 hours of the first dose. These events were confounded by concomitant medications and/or preexisting disease, and the relationship to fingolimod is uncertain. Cases of syncope were also reported after the first dose of fingolimod.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.2 Infections</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Risk of Infections</content>
                           <br/>
                           <br/> Fingolimod causesÂ a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20% to 30% of baseline values because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. Fingolimod may therefore increase the risk of infections, some serious in nature <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>]. </content>Life-threatening and fatal infections have occurred in association with fingolimod.<br/>
                           <br/> Before initiating treatment with fingolimod, a recent CBC (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Consider suspending treatment with fingolimod if a patient develops a serious infection, and reassess the benefits and risks prior to reinitiation of therapy. Because the elimination of fingolimod after discontinuation may take up to 2 months, continue monitoring for infections throughout this period. Instruct patients receiving fingolimod to report symptoms of infections to a physician. Patients with active acute or chronic infections should not start treatment until the infection(s) is resolved. <br/>
                           <br/> In MS placebo-controlled trials in adult patients, the overall rate of infections (72%) with fingolimod was similar to placebo. However, bronchitis, herpes zoster, influenza, sinusitis, and pneumonia were more common in fingolimod-treated patients. Serious infections occurred at a rate of 2.3% in the fingolimod group versus 1.6% in the placebo group.<br/>
                           <br/> In the postmarketing setting, serious infections with opportunistic pathogens, including viruses (e.g., John Cunningham virus [JCV], herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus), fungi (e.g., cryptococci), and bacteria (e.g., atypical mycobacteria) have been reported with fingolimod. Patients with symptoms and signs consistent with any of these infections should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.<br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Herpes Viral Infections</content>
                           <br/>
                           <br/> In placebo-controlled trials in adult patients, the rate of herpetic infections was 9% in patients receiving fingolimod 0.5 mg and 7% on placebo.<br/>
                           <br/> Two patients died of herpetic infections during controlled trials. One death was due to disseminated primary herpes zoster and the other was to herpes simplex encephalitis. In both cases, the patients were taking a 1.25 mg dose of fingolimod (higher than the recommended 0.5 mg dose) and had received high-dose corticosteroid therapy to treat suspected MS relapses.<br/>
                           <br/> Serious, life-threatening events of disseminated varicella zoster and herpes simplex infections, including cases of encephalitis and multiorgan failure, have occurred with fingolimod in the postmarketing setting. Include disseminated herpetic infections in the differential diagnosis of patients who are receiving fingolimod and present with an atypical MS relapse or multiorgan failure.<br/>
                           <br/> Cases of Kaposiâs sarcoma have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Kaposiâs sarcoma is an angioproliferative disorder that is associated with infection with human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8). Patients with symptoms or signs consistent with Kaposiâs sarcoma should be referred for prompt diagnostic evaluation and management.<br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Cryptococcal Infections</content>
                           <br/>
                           <br/> Cryptococcal infections, including cases of fatal cryptococcal meningitis and disseminated cryptococcal infections, have been reported with fingolimod in the postmarketing setting. Cryptococcal infections have generally occurred after approximately 2 years of fingolimod treatment, but may occur earlier. The relationship between the risk of cryptococcal infection and the duration of treatment is unknown. Patients with symptoms and signs consistent with a cryptococcal infection should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation and treatment.<br/>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Prior and Concomitant Treatment with Antineoplastic, Immunosuppressive, or Immune-Modulating Therapies</content>
                           <br/>
                           <br/> In clinical studies, patients who received fingolimod did not receive concomitant treatment with antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies used for treatment of MS. Concomitant use of fingolimod with any of these therapies, and also with corticosteroids, would be expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_7.4">Drug Interactions (7.4)</linkHtml>]</content>.<br/>
                           <br/> When switching to fingolimod from immune-modulating or immunosuppressive medications, consider the duration of their effects and their mode of action to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects.<br/>

                           <br/> Patients without a healthcare professional confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against VZV should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating fingolimod. VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients is recommended prior to commencing treatment with fingolimod, following which initiation of treatment with fingolimod should be postponed for 1 month to allow the full effect of vaccination to occur<content styleCode="italics"> [seeÂ </content>

                     <title>5.3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients with MS who received fingolimod in the postmarketing setting. PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. PML has occurred <content styleCode="xmChange">in </content>patients who had not been treated previously with natalizumab, which has a known association with PML, were not taking any other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medications concomitantly, and did not have any ongoing systemic medical conditions resulting in compromised immune system function.Â Longer treatment duration increases the risk of PML in fingolimod-treated patients; the majority of cases have occurred in patients treated with fingolimod for at least 18 months.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold fingolimod and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Cases of PML, diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms specific to PML, have been reported in patients treated with MS medications associated with PML, including fingolimod. Many of these patients subsequently became symptomatic with PML. Therefore, monitoring with MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be useful, and any suspicious findings should lead to further investigation to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported following discontinuation of another MS medication associated with PML in patients with PML who were initially asymptomatic compared to patients with PML who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis. It is not known whether these differences are due to early detection and discontinuation of MS treatment or due to differences in disease in these patients.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>If PML is confirmed, treatment with fingolimod shouldÂ <content styleCode="xmChange">be</content> discontinued. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators, including fingolimod, who developed PML and subsequently discontinued treatment. IRIS presents as a clinical decline in the patientâs condition that may be rapid, can lead to serious neurological complications or death, andÂ <content styleCode="xmChange">is</content> often associated with characteristic changes on MRI. The time to onset of IRIS in patients with PML was generally within a few months after S1P receptor modulator discontinuation. Monitoring for development of IRIS and appropriate treatment of the associated inflammation should be undertaken.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>S1P receptor modulators, including fingolimod, have been associated with an increased risk of macular edema. Obtain a baseline evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, near the start of treatment with fingolimod. Perform <content styleCode="xmChange">an </content>examination of the fundus, including the macula, 3 to 4 months after starting treatment, periodically while on therapy, and any time there is a change in vision.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>A dose-dependent increase in the risk of macular edema occurred in the fingolimod clinical development program. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adult patients with multiple sclerosis, macular edema with or without visual symptoms occurred in 1.5% of patients (11/799) treated with fingolimod 1.25 mg, 0.5% of patients (4/783) treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg, and 0.4% of patients (3/773) treated with placebo. Macular edema occurred predominantly during the first 3 to 4 months of therapy. These clinical trials excluded patients with diabetes mellitus, a known risk factor for macular edema (see below <content styleCode="italics">Macular Edema in Patients with History of Uveitis or Diabetes Mellitus)</content>. Symptoms of macular edema included blurred vision and decreased visual acuity. Routine ophthalmological examination detected macular edema in some patients with no visual symptoms. Macular edema generally partially or completely resolved with or without treatment after drug discontinuation. Some patients had residual visual acuity loss even after resolution of macular edema. Macular edema has also been reported in patients taking fingolimod in the postmarketing setting, usually within the first 6 months of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Continuation of fingolimod in patients who develop macular edema has not been evaluated. Macular edema over an extended period of time (i.e., 6 months) can lead to permanent visual loss.

                     <title>5.5  	Liver Injury</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinically significant liver injury has occurred in patients treated with fingolimod in the postmarketing setting. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes and elevated total bilirubin, have occurred as early as ten days after the first dose and have also been reported after prolonged use. Cases of acute liver failure requiring liver transplant have been reported.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In 2-year placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients, elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and GGT) to 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater occurred in 14% of patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg and 3% of patients on placebo. Elevations 5-fold the ULN or greater occurred in 4.5% of patients on fingolimod and 1% of patients on placebo. The majority of elevations occurred within 6 to 9 months. In clinical trials, fingolimod was discontinued if the elevation exceeded 5 times the ULN. Serum transaminase levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of fingolimod. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations occurred with rechallenge in some patients.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Prior to starting treatment with fingolimod (within 6 months), obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Obtain transaminase levels and total bilirubin levels periodically until two months after fingolimod discontinuation. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury. Measure liver transaminase and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range, treatment with fingolimod should be interrupted. Treatment should not be resumed if a plausible alternative etiology for the signs and symptoms cannot be established, because these patients are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Because fingolimod exposure is doubled in patients with severe hepatic impairment, these patients should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_8.6">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Section_12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>There have been rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) reported in adult patients receiving fingolimod. Symptoms reported included sudden onset of severe headache, altered mental status, visual disturbances, and seizure. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischemic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, fingolimod should be discontinued.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Dose-dependent reductions in forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV1) and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were observed in patients treated with fingolimod as early as 1 month after treatment initiation. In 2-year placebo-controlled trials in adult patients, the reduction from baseline in the percent of predicted values for FEV1 at the time of last assessment on drug was 2.8% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.0% for placebo. For DLCO, the reduction from baseline in percent of predicted values at the time of last assessment on drug was 3.3% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 0.5% for placebo. The changes in FEV1 appear to be reversible after treatment discontinuation. There is insufficient information to determine the reversibility of the decrease of DLCO after drug discontinuation. In MS placebo-controlled trials in adult patients, dyspnea was reported in 9% of patients receiving fingolimod 0.5 mg and 7% of patients receiving placebo. Several patients discontinued fingolimod because of unexplained dyspnea during the extension (uncontrolled) studies. Fingolimod has not been tested in MS patients with compromised respiratory function.<br/>
                           <br/> Spirometric evaluation of respiratory function and evaluation of DLCO should be performed during therapy with fingolimod if clinically indicated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on findings from animal studies, fingolimod may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, developmental toxicity was observed with administration of fingolimod at doses less than the recommended human dose.

                        <paragraph>MS relapses with tumefactive demyelinating lesions on imaging have been observed during fingolimod therapy and after fingolimod discontinuation in the postmarketing setting. Most reported cases of tumefactive MS in patients receiving fingolimod have occurred within the first 9 months after fingolimod initiation, but tumefactive MS may occur at any point during treatment. Cases of tumefactive MS have also been reported within the first 4 months after fingolimod discontinuation. Tumefactive MS should be considered when a severe MS relapse occurs during fingolimod treatment, especially during initiation, or after discontinuation of fingolimod, prompting imaging evaluation and initiation of appropriate treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.<br/>

                           <br/> In clinical trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3), a total of 1212 patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis received fingolimod 0.5 mg. This included 783 patients who received fingolimod 0.5 mg in the 2-year placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 3) and 429 patients who received fingolimod 0.5 mg in the 1-year active-controlled trial (Study 2). The overall exposure in the controlled trials was equivalent to 1716 person-years. Approximately 1000 patients received at least 2 years of treatment with fingolimod 0.5 mg. In all clinical studies, including uncontrolled extension studies, the exposure to fingolimod 0.5 mg was approximately 4119 person-years.<br/>
                           <br/> In placebo-controlled trials, the most frequent adverse reactions (incidence â¥ 10% and greater than placebo) for fingolimod 0.5 mg were headache, liver transaminase elevation, diarrhea, cough, influenza, sinusitis, back pain, abdominal pain, and pain in extremity. Adverse events that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred in more than 1% of patients taking fingolimod 0.5 mg, were serum transaminase elevations (4.7% compared to 1% on placebo) and basal cell carcinoma (1% compared to 0.5% on placebo).<br/>
                           <br/> Table 1 lists adverse reactions in clinical studies in adults that occurred in â¥ 1% of fingolimod-treated patients and â¥ 1% higher rate than for placebo.<content styleCode="bold">Â </content>

                        <paragraph>Experience with fingolimod in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow the heart rate orÂ AV conduction (e.g., beta blockers, digoxin, or heart rate-slowing calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem or verapamil) is limited. Because initiation of fingolimod treatment may result in an additional decrease in heart rate, concomitant use of these drugs during fingolimod initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia or heart block. Seek advice from the physician prescribing these drugs regarding the possibility to switch to drugs that do not slow the heart rate or atrioventricular conduction before initiating fingolimod. Patients who cannot switch should have overnight continuous ECG monitoring after the first dose <content styleCode="italics">[seeÂ <linkHtml href="#Section_2.5">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#Section_5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In oral studies conducted in rats and rabbits, fingolimod demonstrated developmental toxicity, including an increase in malformations (rats) and embryolethality, when given to pregnant animals. In rats, the highest no-effect dose was less than the recommended human dose of 0.5 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis. The most common fetal visceral malformations in rats were persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect. The receptor affected by fingolimod (sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor) is known to be involved in vascular formation during embryogenesis <content styleCode="italics">(see Data).</content> Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>When fingolimod was orally administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis (0, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg/day or 0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day), increased incidences of fetal malformations and embryofetal deaths were observed at all but the lowest dose tested (0.03 mg/kg/day), which is less than the recommended human dose (RHD) on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. Oral administration to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (0, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 mg/kg/day) resulted in increased incidences of embryofetal mortality and fetal growth retardation at the mid and high doses. The no-effect dose for these effects in rabbits (0.5 mg/kg/day) is approximately 20 times the RHD on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis.</paragraph>

                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM1"/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>Fingolimod hydrochloride USP is a white to practically white powder that is freely soluble in water and alcohol. It has a molecular weight of 343.93 g/mol.<br/>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Fingolimod is metabolized by sphingosine kinase to the active metabolite, fingolimod-phosphate. Fingolimod-phosphate is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, and binds with high affinity to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1, 3, 4, and 5. Fingolimod-phosphate blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, reducing the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. The mechanism by which fingolimod exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is unknown, but may involve reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system.</paragraph>

                           <br/>
                           <br/> In a thorough QT interval study of doses of 1.25 or 2.5 mg fingolimod at steady-state, when a negative chronotropic effect of fingolimod was still present, fingolimod treatment resulted in a prolongation of QTc, with the upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of 14.0 msec. There is no consistent signal of increased incidence of QTc outliers, either absolute or change from baseline, associated with fingolimod treatment. In MS studies, there was no clinically relevant prolongation of the QT interval, but patients at risk for QT prolongation were not included in clinical studies.<br/>

                           <br/> In a study in which 12 adult subjects received fingolimod 0.5 mg daily, the lymphocyte count decreased to approximately 60% of baseline within 4 to 6 hours after the first dose. With continued daily dosing, the lymphocyte count continued to decrease over a 2-week period, reaching a nadir count of approximately 500 cells/mcL or approximately 30% of baseline. In a placebo-controlled study in 1272 MS patients (of whom 425 received fingolimod 0.5 mg daily and 418 received placebo), 18% (N = 78) of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg reached a nadir of &lt; 200 cells/mcL on at least 1 occasion. No patient on placebo reached a nadir of &lt; 200 cells/mcL. Low lymphocyte counts are maintained with chronic daily dosing of fingolimod 0.5 mg daily.<br/>
                           <br/> Chronic fingolimod dosing leads to a mild decrease in the neutrophil count to approximately 80% of baseline. Monocytes are unaffected by fingolimod.<br/>
                           <br/> Peripheral lymphocyte count increases are evident within days of stopping fingolimod treatment and typically normal counts are reached within 1 to 2 months.<br/>

                           <br/> Fingolimod reduces the immune response to vaccination, as evaluated in 2 studies.<br/>
                           <br/> In the first study, the immunogenicity of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) immunization were assessed by IgM and IgG titers in a steady-state, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy adult volunteers. Compared to placebo, antigen-specific IgM titers were decreased by 91% and 25% in response to KLH and PPV-23, respectively, in subjects on fingolimod 0.5 mg. Similarly, IgG titers were decreased by 45% and 50%, in response to KLH and PPV-23, respectively, in subjects on fingolimod 0.5 mg daily compared to placebo. The responder rate for fingolimod 0.5 mg as measured by the number of subjects with a &gt; 4-fold increase in KLH IgG was comparable to placebo and 25% lower for PPV-23 IgG, while the number of subjects with a &gt; 4-fold increase in KLH and PPV-23 IgM was 75% and 40% lower, respectively, compared to placebo. The capacity to mount a skin delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to <content styleCode="italics">Candida</content> and tetanus toxoid was decreased by approximately 30% in subjects on fingolimod 0.5 mg daily, compared to placebo. Immunologic responses were further decreased with fingolimod 1.25 mg (a dose higher than recommended in MS) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.<br/>
                           <br/> In the second study, the immunogenicity of Northern hemisphere seasonal influenza and tetanus toxoid vaccination was assessed in a 12-week steady-state, randomized, placebo-controlled study of fingolimod 0.5 mg in adult multiple sclerosis patients (n = 136). The responder rate 3 weeks after vaccination, defined as seroconversion or a â¥ 4-fold increase in antibody directed against at least 1 of the 3 influenza strains, was 54% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 85% in the placebo group. The responder rate 3 weeks after vaccination, defined as seroconversion or a â¥ 4-fold increase in antibody directed against tetanus toxoid was 40% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 61% in the placebo group.<br/>

                           <br/> Single fingolimod doses â¥ 5 mg (10-fold the recommended dose) are associated with a dose-dependent increase in airway resistance. In a 14-day study of 0.5, 1.25, or 5 mg/day, fingolimod was not associated with impaired oxygenation or oxygen desaturation with exercise or an increase in airway responsiveness to methacholine. Subjects on fingolimod treatment had a normal bronchodilator response to inhaled beta-agonists.<br/>
                           <br/> In a 14-day placebo-controlled study of adult patients with moderate asthma, no effect was seen for fingolimod 0.5 mg (recommended dose in MS). A 10% reduction in mean FEV1 at 6 hours after dosing was observed in adult patients receiving fingolimod 1.25 mg (a dose higher than recommended for use in MS) on Day 10 of treatment. Fingolimod 1.25 mg was associated with a 5-fold increase in the use of rescue short-acting beta-agonists.</paragraph>

                           <br/> The T<sub>max </sub>of fingolimod is 12 to 16 hours. The apparent absolute oral bioavailability is 93%.<br/>
                           <br/>Food intake does not alter C<sub>max</sub> or (AUC) of fingolimod or fingolimod-phosphate. Therefore, fingolimod may be taken without regard to meals.<br/>
                           <br/> Steady-state blood concentrations are reached within 1 to 2 months following once-daily administration and steady-state levels are approximately 10-fold greater than with the initial dose.<br/>

                           <br/> Fingolimod highly (86%) distributes in red blood cells. Fingolimod-phosphate has a smaller uptake in blood cells of &lt; 17%. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate are &gt; 99.7% protein bound. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate protein binding is not altered by renal or hepatic impairment.<br/>
                           <br/> Fingolimod is extensively distributed to body tissues with a volume of distribution of about 1200 Â± 260 L.<br/>

                           <br/>
                           <br/> The biotransformation of fingolimod in humans occurs by 3 main pathways: by reversible stereoselective phosphorylation to the pharmacologically active (<content styleCode="italics">S</content>)-enantiomer of fingolimod-phosphate, by oxidative biotransformation catalyzed mainly by the cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) and possibly other CYP4F isoenzymes with subsequent fatty acid-like degradation to inactive metabolites, and by formation of pharmacologically inactive non-polar ceramide analogs of fingolimod.<br/>
                           <br/> Inhibitors or inducers of CYP4F2 and possibly other CYP4F isozymes might alter the exposure of fingolimod or fingolimod-phosphate. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies in hepatocytes indicated that CYP3A4 may contribute to fingolimod metabolism in the case of strong induction of CYP3A4.<br/>
                           <br/> Following single oral administration of [<sup>14</sup>C] fingolimod, the major fingolimod-related components in blood, as judged from their contribution to the AUC up to 816 hours post-dose of total radiolabeled components, are fingolimod itself (23.3%), fingolimod-phosphate (10.3%), and inactive metabolites [M3 carboxylic acid metabolite (8.3%), M29 ceramide metabolite (8.9%), and M30 ceramide metabolite (7.3%)].<br/>

                           <br/>
                           <br/> Fingolimod blood clearance is 6.3 Â± 2.3 L/h, and the average apparent terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) is 6 to 9 days. Blood levels of fingolimod-phosphate decline in parallel with those of fingolimod in the terminal phase, yielding similar half-lives for both.<br/>
                           <br/> After oral administration, about 81% of the dose is slowly excreted in the urine as inactive metabolites. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate are not excreted intact in urine but are the major components in the feces with amounts of each representing less than 2.5% of the dose.<br/>

                              <br/> In vitro</content> inhibition studies using pooled human liver microsomes and specific metabolic probe substrates demonstrate that fingolimod has little or no capacity to inhibit the activity of the following CYP enzymes: CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, or CYP4A9/11 (fingolimod only), and similarly fingolimod-phosphate has little or no capacity to inhibit the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4 at concentrations up to 3 orders of magnitude of therapeutic concentrations. Therefore, fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate are unlikely to reduce the clearance of drugs that are mainly cleared through metabolism by the major CYP isoenzymes described above.<br/>

                           <br/> Fingolimod was examined for its potential to induce human CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP4F2, and MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) mRNA and CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP4F2 activity in primary human hepatocytes. Fingolimod did not induce mRNA or activity of the different CYP enzymes and MDR1 with respect to the vehicle control; therefore, no clinically relevant induction of the tested CYP enzymes or MDR1 by fingolimod are expected at therapeutic concentrations. Fingolimod-phosphate was also examined for its potential to induce mRNA and/or activity of human CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A, CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, and CYP4F12. Fingolimod-phosphate is not expected to have clinically significant induction effects on these enzymes at therapeutic doses of fingolimod. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> experiments did not provide an indication of CYP induction by fingolimod-phosphate.<br/>

                           <br/> Based on <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> data, fingolimod as well as fingolimod-phosphate are not expected to inhibit the uptake of comedications and/or biologics transported by the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). Similarly, they are not expected to inhibit the efflux of comedications and/or biologics transported by the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), the bile salt export pump (BSEP), the multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at therapeutic concentrations.<br/>

                           <br/> The coadministration of fingolimod 0.5 mg daily with oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) did not elicit any clinically significant change in oral contraceptives exposure. Fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate exposure were consistent with those from previous studies. No interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing other progestagens; however, an effect of fingolimod on their exposure is not expected.<br/>

                           <br/> The pharmacokinetics of single-dose fingolimod was not altered during coadministration with cyclosporine at steady-state, nor was cyclosporine steady-state pharmacokinetics altered by fingolimod. These data indicate that fingolimod is unlikely to reduce or increase the clearance of drugs cleared mainly by CYP3A4. Potent inhibition of transporters MDR1 (P-gp), MRP2, and OATP-1B1 does not influence fingolimod disposition.<br/>

In addition, the following commonly coprescribed substances had no clinically relevant effect (&lt; 20%) on fingolimod or fingolimod-phosphate predose concentrations: baclofen, gabapentin, oxybutynin, amantadine, modafinil, amitriptyline, pregabalin, and corticosteroids.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oral carcinogenicity studies of fingolimod were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, fingolimod was administered at oral doses of 0, 0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day for up to 2 years. The incidence of malignant lymphoma was increased in males and females at the mid and high dose. The lowest dose tested (0.025 mg/kg/day) is less than the RHD of 0.5 mg/day on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis. In rats, fingolimod was administered at oral doses of 0, 0.05, 0.15, 0.5, and 2.5 mg/kg/day. No increase in tumors was observed. The highest dose tested (2.5 mg/kg/day) is approximately 50 times the RHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.<br/>
                           <br/> Fingolimod was negative in a battery of <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> (Ames, mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase, chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells) and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>(micronucleus in mouse and rat) assays.<br/>
                           <br/> When fingolimod was administered orally (0, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day) to male and female rats prior to and during mating, and continuing to Day 7 of gestation in females, no effect on fertility was observed up to the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg), which is approximately 200 times the RHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lung toxicity was observed in 2 different strains of rats and in dogs and monkeys. The primary findings included increase in lung weight, associated with smooth muscle hypertrophy, hyperdistention of the alveoli, and/or increased collagen. Insufficient or lack of pulmonary collapse at necropsy, generally correlated with microscopic changes, was observed in all species. In rats and monkeys, lung toxicity was observed at all oral doses tested in chronic studies. The lowest doses tested in rats (0.05 mg/kg/day in the 2-year carcinogenicity study) and monkeys (0.5 mg/kg/day in the 39-week toxicity study) are similar to and approximately 20 times the RHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis, respectively.<br/>
                           <br/> In the 52-week oral study in monkeys, respiratory distress associated with ketamine administration was observed at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day; the most affected animal became hypoxic and required oxygenation. As ketamine is not generally associated with respiratory depression, this effect was attributed to fingolimod. In a subsequent study in rats, ketamine was shown to potentiate the bronchoconstrictive effects of fingolimod. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of fingolimod was demonstrated in 2 studies that evaluated once-daily doses of fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Both studies included patients who had experienced at least 2 clinical relapses during the 2 years prior to randomization or at least 1 clinical relapse during the 1 year prior to randomization, and had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.5. Study 1 was a 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with RRMS who had not received any interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate for at least the previous 3 months and had not received any natalizumab for at least the previous 6 months. Neurological evaluations were performed at screening, every 3 months and at time of suspected relapse. MRI evaluations were performed at screening, Month 6, Month 12, and Month 24. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate.<br/>
                           <br/> Median age was 37 years, median disease duration was 6.7 years and median EDSS score at baseline was 2.0. Patients were randomized to receive fingolimod 0.5 mg (N = 425), 1.25 mg (N = 429), or placebo (N = 418) for up to 24 months. Median time on study drug was 717 days on 0.5 mg, 715 days on 1.25 mg, and 719 days on placebo.<br/>
                           <br/> The annualized relapse rate was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod than in patients who received placebo. The secondary endpoint was the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression as measured by at least a 1Â­-point increase from baseline in EDSS (0.5-point increase for patients with baseline EDSS of 5.5) sustained for 3 months. Time to onset of 3-month confirmed disability progression was significantly delayed with fingolimod treatment compared to placebo. The 1.25 mg dose resulted in no additional benefit over the fingolimod 0.5 mg dose. The results for this study are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1.</paragraph>

                           <br/> Study 2 was a 1-year randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled study in patients with RRMS who had not received any natalizumab in the previous 6 months. Prior therapy with interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate up to the time of randomization was permitted.<br/>
                           <br/> Neurological evaluations were performed at screening, every 3 months, and at the time of suspected relapses. MRI evaluations were performed at screening and at Month 12. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate.<br/>
                           <br/> Median age was 36 years, median disease duration was 5.9 years, and median EDSS score at baseline was 2.0. Patients were randomized to receive fingolimod 0.5 mg (N = 431), 1.25 mg (N = 426), or interferon beta-1a, 30 mcg via the intramuscular route (IM) once-weekly (N = 435) for up to 12 months. Median time on study drug was 365 days on fingolimod 0.5 mg, 354 days on 1.25 mg, and 361 days on interferon beta-1a IM.<br/>
                           <br/> The annualized relapse rate was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg than in patients who received interferon beta-1a IM. The key secondary endpoints were number of new and newly enlarging T2 lesions and time to onset of 3-month confirmed disability progression as measured by at least a 1-point increase from baseline in EDSS (0.5-point increase for those with baseline EDSS of 5.5) sustained for 3 months. The number of new and newly enlarging T2 lesions was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod than in patients who received interferon beta-1a IM. There was no significant difference in the time to 3-month confirmed disability progression between fingolimod and interferon beta-1a-treated patients at Â Â Â Â 1 year. The 1.25 mg dose resulted in no additional benefit over the fingolimod 0.5 mg dose. The results for this study are shown in Table 3.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Study 4 (NCT 01892722) evaluated the efficacy of once-daily oral doses of fingolimod 0.5 mg in pediatric patients 10 to less than 18 years of age with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Study 4 was a 215-patient, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial that compared fingolimod to intramuscular interferon beta-1a. Prior therapy with interferon-beta, dimethyl fumarate, or glatiramer acetate up to the time of randomization was permitted. The study included patients who had experienced at least 1 clinical relapse during the year prior or 2 relapses during the 2 years prior to screening, or evidence of 1 or more Gd-enhancing lesions on MRI within 6 months prior to randomization, and had an EDSS score from 0 to 5.5. Neurological evaluations were scheduled at screening, every 3 months, and at the time of suspected relapses. MRI evaluations were performed at screening and every 6 months throughout the study. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At baseline, the median age was 16 years, median disease duration since first symptom was 1.5 years, and median EDSS score was 1.5. One patient received no study drug and is excluded from the analysis of efficacy. Median duration of exposure to study drug was 634 days in the fingolimod group (n = 107) and 547 days in the interferon beta-1a group (n = 107). In the fingolimod group, 6.5% of patients did not complete the study, compared to 18.5% in the interferon beta-1a group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint, the annualized relapse rate (ARR), was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod (0.122) than in patients who received interferon beta-1a (0.675). Relative reduction in ARR was 81.9%. The annualized rate of the number of new or newly enlarged T2 lesions up to Month 24 (key secondary endpoint) was significantly lower in patients treated with fingolimod, as was the number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions per scan up to Month 24.</paragraph>
