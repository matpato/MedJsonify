                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg is indicated for the twice-daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg is also indicated to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations. Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg twice daily is the only approved dosage for the treatment of COPD because an efficacy advantage of the higher strength fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg over fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg has not been demonstrated.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder should be administered as 1 inhalation twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>More frequent administration or a greater number of inhalations (more than 1 inhalation twice daily) of the prescribed strength of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder is not recommended as some patients are more likely to experience adverse effects with higher doses of salmeterol. Patients using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder should not use additional LABA for any reason <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (</content>

                        <paragraph>Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder can occur within 30 minutes of beginning treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dosage after 2 weeks of therapy, replacing the current strength of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder with a higher strength may provide additional improvement in asthma control.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the current strength of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder with a higher strength, adding additional ICS, initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Use of LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death <content styleCode="italics">[see Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)]</content>. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone <content styleCode="italics">(see Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-acting Beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic Agonists)</content>.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Four (4) large, 26-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical safety trials were conducted to evaluate the risk of serious asthma-related events when LABA were used in fixed-dose combination with ICS compared with ICS alone in subjects with asthma. Three (3) trials included adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older: 1 trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder [<content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#ID_83c652c9-5580-4fec-9f8c-f40467d6a815">14.1</linkHtml>)</content>], 1 trial compared mometasone furoate/formoterol with mometasone furoate, and 1 trial compared budesonide/formoterol with budesonide. The fourth trial included pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years and compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder [<content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#ID_83c652c9-5580-4fec-9f8c-f40467d6a815">14.1</linkHtml>)</content>]. The primary safety endpoint for all 4 trials was serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death). A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma related.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The 3 adult and adolescent trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the 3 adult and adolescent trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma or COPD. Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD. The initiation of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in this setting is not appropriate. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol, a component of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function). However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder with a higher strength, adding additional ICS, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When beginning treatment with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.</paragraph>

When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while treatment with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder continues, but at times therapy with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder may need to be interrupted. Advise the patient to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing following inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ICS should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Particular care is needed for patients who have been transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ICS because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available ICS. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder may control asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate, a component of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of ICS in sensitive patients, patients treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and other treatments for management of asthma symptoms should be considered.</paragraph>

In addition, beta‑agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing ICS. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids), should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Since patients with COPD often have multiple risk factors for reduced BMD, assessment of BMD is recommended prior to initiating fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder and periodically thereafter. If significant reductions in BMD are seen and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder is still considered medically important for that patient’s COPD therapy, use of medicine to treat or prevent osteoporosis should be strongly considered.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.15 Glaucoma and Cataracts   </title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported in patients with asthma and COPD following the long-term administration of ICS, including fluticasone propionate, a component of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder long term.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Effects of treatment with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, or placebo on development of cataracts or glaucoma was evaluated in a subset of 658 subjects with COPD in the 3-year survival trial. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline and at 48, 108, and 158 weeks. Conclusions about cataracts cannot be drawn from this trial because the high incidence of cataracts at baseline (61% to 71%) resulted in an inadequate number of subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg who were eligible and available for evaluation of cataracts at the end of the trial (n = 53). The incidence of newly diagnosed glaucoma was 2% with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, 5% with fluticasone propionate, 0% with salmeterol, and 2% with placebo.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate, a component of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other ICS in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID_a9114a82-4e4b-4f19-b057-851a3acf0977">12.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Clinically significant changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen infrequently during clinical trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder at recommended doses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The short-term safety data are based on exposure to fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg twice daily in one 6-month and two 1-year clinical trials. In the 6-month trial, a total of 723 adult subjects (266 females and 457 males) were treated twice daily with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, salmeterol inhalation powder, or placebo. The mean age of the subjects was 64, and the majority (93%) was Caucasian. In this trial, 70% of the subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder reported an adverse reaction compared with 64% on placebo. The average duration of exposure to fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg was 141.3 days compared with 131.6 days for placebo. The incidence of adverse reactions in the 6-month trial is shown in Table 3.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the two 1-year trials, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg was compared with salmeterol in 1,579 subjects (863 males and 716 females). The mean age of the subjects was 65 years, and the majority (94%) was Caucasian. To be enrolled, all of the subjects had to have had a COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months. In this trial, 88% of the subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder and 86% of the subjects treated with <br/>salmeterol reported an adverse event. The most common events that occurred with a frequency of  &gt;5% and more frequently in the subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, nasal congestion, back pain, sinusitis, dizziness, nausea, pneumonia, candidiasis, and dysphonia. Overall, 55 (7%) of the subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder and 25 (3%) of the subjects treated with salmeterol developed pneumonia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The incidence of pneumonia was higher in subjects older than 65 years, 9% in the subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder compared with 4% in the subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder younger than 65 years. In the subjects treated with salmeterol, the incidence of pneumonia was the same (3%) in both age groups <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_10f62534-fbca-4a10-8b41-b5ce1f480152">5.5</linkHtml>), Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#ID_1bbf7d45-a0aa-4b90-b6c2-8f1adac986e2">8.5</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international, 3-year trial in 6,184 adult subjects with COPD (4,684 males and 1,500 females). The mean age of the subjects was 65 years, and the majority (82%) was Caucasian. The distribution of adverse events was similar to that seen in the 1-year trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg. In addition, pneumonia was reported in a significantly increased number of subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg (16% and 14%, respectively) compared with subjects treated with salmeterol 50 mcg or placebo (11% and 9%, respectively). When adjusted for time on treatment, the rates of pneumonia were 84 and 88 events per 1,000 treatment-years in the groups treated with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg and with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, respectively, compared with 52 events per 1,000 treatment-years in the salmeterol and placebo groups. Similar to what was seen in the 1-year trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, the incidence of pneumonia was higher in subjects older than 65 years (18% with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg versus 10% with placebo) compared with subjects younger than 65 years (14% with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg versus 8% with placebo) <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID_10f62534-fbca-4a10-8b41-b5ce1f480152">5.5</linkHtml>), Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#ID_1bbf7d45-a0aa-4b90-b6c2-8f1adac986e2">8.5</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma or COPD. Therefore, patients with asthma or COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium‑ sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, such as salmeterol, a component of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder with non–potassium-sparing diuretics.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are insufficient data on the use of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder or individual monoproducts, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate, in pregnant women. There are clinical considerations with the use of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in pregnant women (<content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Considerations</content>). In animals, teratogenicity characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis (see <content styleCode="italics">Data</content>). However, fluticasone propionate administered via inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis (see <content styleCode="italics">Data</content>). Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. Oral administration of salmeterol to pregnant rabbits caused teratogenicity characteristic of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation at maternal doses approximately 50 times the MRHDID on an AUC basis. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when salmeterol was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No such effects occurred at an oral salmeterol dose approximately 20 times the MRHDID (see <content styleCode="italics">Data</content>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk:</content> In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal control of asthma.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Labor and Delivery: There are no human studies evaluating the effects of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder during labor and delivery. Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.</paragraph>

In pregnant Dutch rabbits administered salmeterol doses approximately 50 times the MRHDID (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses of 1,000 mcg/kg/day and higher), fetal toxic effects were observed characteristically resulting from beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. These included precocious eyelid openings, cleft palate, sternebral fusion, limb and paw flexures, and delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones. No such effects occurred at a salmeterol dose approximately 20 times the MRHDID (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 600 mcg/kg/day). New Zealand White rabbits were less sensitive since only delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones was seen at a salmeterol dose approximately 2,000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day).</paragraph>

The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, should be monitored.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A 52-week placebo-controlled trial to assess the potential growth effects of fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (FLOVENT ROTADISK) at 50 and 100 mcg twice daily was conducted in the U.S. in 325 prepubescent children (244 males and 81 females) aged 4 to 11 years. The mean growth velocities at 52 weeks observed in the intent-to-treat population were 6.32 cm/year in the placebo group (n = 76), 6.07 cm/year in the 50-mcg group (n = 98), and 5.66 cm/year in the 100-mcg group (n = 89). An imbalance in the proportion of children entering puberty between groups and a higher dropout rate in the placebo group due to poorly controlled asthma may be confounding factors in interpreting these data. A separate subset analysis of children who remained prepubertal during the trial revealed growth rates at 52 weeks of 6.10 cm/year in the placebo group (n = 57), 5.91 cm/year in the 50-mcg group (n = 74), and 5.67 cm/year in the 100-mcg group (n = 79). In children aged 8.5 years, the mean age of children in this trial, the range for expected growth velocity is: boys – 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile = 3.8 cm/year, 50<sup>th</sup> percentile = 5.4 cm/year, and 97<sup>th</sup> percentile = 7.0 cm/year; girls – 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile = 4.2 cm/year, 50<sup>th</sup> percentile = 5.7 cm/year, and 97<sup>th</sup> percentile = 7.3 cm/year. The clinical relevance of these growth data is not certain.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Clinical trials of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder for asthma did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether older subjects with asthma respond differently than younger subjects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder for COPD, 1,621 were aged 65 years and older and 379 were aged 75 years and older. Subjects with COPD aged 65 years and older had a higher incidence of serious adverse events compared with subjects younger than 65 years. Although the distribution of adverse events was similar in the 2 age groups, subjects older than 65 years experienced more severe events. In two 1-year trials, the excess risk of pneumonia that was seen in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder compared with those treated with salmeterol was greater in subjects older than 65 years than in subjects younger than 65 years <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_12a6d52c-4c39-4352-b13b-296d44188b0e">6.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. As with other products containing beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists, special caution should be observed when using fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in geriatric patients who have concomitant cardiovascular disease that could be adversely affected by beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists. Based on available data for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder or its active components, no adjustment of dosage of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in geriatric patients is warranted.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No relationship between fluticasone propionate systemic exposure and age was observed in 57 subjects with COPD (aged 40 to 82 years) given 250 or 500 mcg twice daily.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in cases of overdosage.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Salmeterol xinafoate is a white to off-white powder with a molecular weight of 603.75, and the empirical formula is C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>37</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>•C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. It is freely soluble in methanol; slightly soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and isopropanol; and sparingly soluble in water.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder is in a gray plastic inhaler containing a foil blister strip. Each blister on the strip contains a white powder mix of micronized fluticasone propionate (100 mcg or 250 mcg) and micronized salmeterol xinafoate salt (72.5 mcg, equivalent to 50 mcg of salmeterol base) in 12.5 mg of formulation containing lactose monohydrate (which contains milk proteins). After the inhaler is activated, the powder is dispersed into the airstream created by the patient inhaling through the mouthpiece.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Under standardized in vitro test conditions, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder delivers 93 mcg and 233 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 45 mcg of salmeterol base per blister from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, respectively, when tested at a flow rate of 60 L/min for 2 seconds. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In adult subjects with obstructive lung disease and severely compromised lung function (mean FEV<sub>1</sub> 20% to 30% of predicted), mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through another dry powder inhaler was 82.4 L/min (range: 46.1 to 115.3 L/min).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Inhalation profiles for adolescent (N = 13, aged 12 to 17 years) and adult (N = 17, aged 18 to 50 years) subjects with asthma inhaling maximally through another dry powder inhaler show mean PIF of 122.2 L/min (range: 81.6 to 152.1 L/min). Inhalation profiles for pediatric subjects with asthma inhaling maximally through another dry powder inhaler show a mean PIF of 75.5 L/min (range: 49.0 to 104.8 L/min) for the 4‑year‑old subject set (N = 20) and 107.3 L/min (range: 82.8 to 125.6 L/min) for the 8‑year‑old subject set (N = 20). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors, such as inspiratory flow profile.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Fluticasone Propionate</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in asthma.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inflammation is also a component in the pathogenesis of COPD. In contrast to asthma, however, the predominant inflammatory cells in COPD include neutrophils, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. The effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of COPD are not well defined and ICS and fluticasone propionate when used apart from fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder are not indicated for the treatment of COPD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Salmeterol Xinafoate</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists may have cardiac effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacologic effects of beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’,5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>, from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor– induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness.</paragraph>

                           </content> Since systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol are not normally seen at the therapeutic dose, higher doses were used to produce measurable effects. Four (4) trials were conducted with healthy adult subjects: (1) a single-dose crossover trial using 2 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg and salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg given concurrently, or fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg given alone, (2) a cumulative-dose trial using 50 to 400 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder given alone or as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, (3) a repeat-dose trial for 11 days using 2 inhalations twice daily of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 250 mcg, or salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, and (4) a single-dose trial using 5 inhalations of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg alone, or placebo. In these trials no significant differences were observed in the pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and glucose) whether the salmeterol was given as fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, concurrently with fluticasone propionate from separate inhalers, or as salmeterol alone. The systemic pharmacodynamic effects of salmeterol were not altered by the presence of fluticasone propionate in fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. The potential effect of salmeterol on the effects of fluticasone propionate on the HPA axis was also evaluated in these trials.</paragraph>

For most subjects, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by 30-minute cosyntropin stimulation, remained intact with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder. One subject (3%) who received fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg had an abnormal response (peak serum cortisol less than 18 mcg/dL) after dosing, compared with 2 subjects (6%) who received placebo, 2 subjects (6%) who received fluticasone propionate 250 mcg, and no subjects who received salmeterol.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a 24-week trial, 130 subjects with COPD received continuous 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring prior to the first dose and after 4 weeks of twice-daily treatment with either fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg, salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg, or placebo. No significant differences in ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias and heart rate were observed among the groups treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, the individual components, or placebo. One (1) subject in the fluticasone propionate group experienced atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation, and 1 subject in the group given fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg experienced heart block.

                           </content> Fluticasone propionate acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate is negligible (less than 1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following administration of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder to healthy adult subjects, peak plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate were achieved in 1 to 2 hours. In a single-dose crossover trial, a higher-than-recommended dose of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder was administered to 14 healthy adult subjects. Two (2) inhalations of the following treatments were administered: fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg and salmeterol inhalation powder 50 mcg given concurrently, and fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 500 mcg alone. Mean peak plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate averaged 107, 94, and 120 pg/mL, respectively, indicating no significant changes in systemic exposures of fluticasone propionate.</paragraph>

Similar results were observed for peak fluticasone propionate plasma concentrations (186 and 182 pg/mL from ADVAIR HFA and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, respectively, and 307 pg/mL from the fluticasone propionate CFC inhalation aerosol). Absolute bioavailability of fluticasone propionate was 5.3% and 5.5% following administration of ADVAIR HFA and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, respectively.</paragraph>

Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (less than 10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable peak levels (C<sub>max</sub>) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC<sub>(0-τ)</sub> averaged 8.43 pg•h/mL (range: 4.2 to 18.8 pg•h/mL).

                        <paragraph>In clinical trials comparing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder with its individual components, improvements in most efficacy endpoints were greater with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder than with the use of either fluticasone propionate or salmeterol alone. In addition, clinical trials showed similar results between fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder and the concurrent use of fluticasone propionate plus salmeterol at corresponding doses from separate inhalers.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Trials Comparing Fluticasone Propionate and Salmeterol Inhalation Powder with Fluticasone Propionate Alone or Salmeterol Alone:</content> Three (3) double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials were conducted with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder in 1,208 adult and adolescent subjects (aged 12 years and older, baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> 63% to 72% of predicted normal) with asthma that was not optimally controlled on their current therapy. All treatments were inhalation powders given as 1 inhalation from a dry powder inhaler twice daily, and other maintenance therapies were discontinued.</paragraph>

                           </content> This placebo-controlled, 12-week, U.S. trial compared fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg with its individual components, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg. The trial was stratified according to baseline asthma maintenance therapy; subjects were using either ICS (n = 250) (daily doses of beclomethasone dipropionate 252 to 420 mcg; flunisolide 1,000 mcg; fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol 176 mcg; or triamcinolone acetonide 600 to 1,000 mcg) or salmeterol (n = 106). Baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements were similar across treatments: fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, 2.17 L; fluticasone propionate 100 mcg, 2.11 L; salmeterol, 2.13 L; and placebo, 2.15 L.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Predefined withdrawal criteria for lack of efficacy, an indicator of worsening asthma, were utilized for this placebo-controlled trial. Worsening asthma was defined as a clinically important decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> or PEF, increase in use of VENTOLIN (albuterol, USP) Inhalation Aerosol, increase in night awakenings due to asthma, emergency intervention or hospitalization due to asthma, or requirement for asthma medication not allowed by the protocol. As shown in Table 4, statistically significantly fewer subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg were withdrawn due to worsening asthma compared with fluticasone propionate, salmeterol, and placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The FEV<sub>1</sub> results are displayed in Figure 1. Because this trial used predetermined criteria for worsening asthma, which caused more subjects in the placebo group to be withdrawn, FEV<sub>1</sub> results at Endpoint (last available FEV<sub>1</sub> result) are also provided. Subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg had significantly greater improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (0.51 L, 25%) compared with fluticasone propionate 100 mcg (0.28 L, 15%), salmeterol (0.11 L, 5%), and placebo (0.01 L, 1%). These improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder were achieved regardless of baseline asthma maintenance therapy (ICS or salmeterol).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The subjective impact of asthma on subjects’ perception of health was evaluated through use of an instrument called the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) (based on a 7-point scale where 1 = maximum impairment and 7 = none). Subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg had clinically meaningful improvements in overall asthma-specific quality of life as defined by a difference between groups of  ≥0.5 points in change from baseline AQLQ scores (difference in AQLQ score of 1.25 compared with placebo).</paragraph>

                           </content> This placebo-controlled, 12-week, U.S. trial compared fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg with its individual components, fluticasone propionate 250 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg, in 349 subjects with asthma using ICS (daily doses of beclomethasone dipropionate 462 to 672 mcg; flunisolide 1,250 to 2,000 mcg; fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol 440 mcg; or triamcinolone acetonide 1,100 to 1,600 mcg). Baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements were similar across treatments: fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, 2.23 L; fluticasone propionate 250 mcg, 2.12 L; salmeterol, 2.20 L; and placebo, 2.19 L.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy results in this trial were similar to those observed in Trial 1. Subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg had significantly greater improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (0.48 L, 23%) compared with fluticasone propionate 250 mcg (0.25 L, 13%), salmeterol (0.05 L, 4%), and placebo (decrease of 0.11 L, decrease of 5%). Statistically significantly fewer subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg were withdrawn from this trial for worsening asthma (4%) compared with fluticasone propionate (22%), salmeterol (38%), and placebo (62%). In addition, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg was superior to fluticasone propionate, salmeterol, and placebo for improvements in morning and evening PEF. Subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg also had clinically meaningful improvements in overall asthma-specific quality of life as described in Trial 1 (difference in AQLQ score of 1.29 compared with placebo).</paragraph>

The primary efficacy parameter, morning PEF, was collected daily for the first 12 weeks of the trial. The primary purpose of weeks 13 to 28 was to collect safety data.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Baseline PEF measurements were similar across treatments: fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, 359 L/min; fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, 351 L/min; and concurrent therapy, 345 L/min. Morning PEF improved significantly with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg compared with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg over the 12-week treatment period.

Maximum improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> generally occurred within 3 hours, and clinically significant improvement was maintained for 12 hours (Figure 2). Following the initial dose, predose FEV<sub>1</sub> relative to Day 1 baseline improved markedly over the first week of treatment and continued to improve over the 12 weeks of treatment in both trials. No diminution in the 12-hour bronchodilator effect was observed with either fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg (Figures 2 and 3) or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg as assessed by FEV<sub>1</sub> following 12 weeks of therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a 12-week U.S. trial, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg twice daily was compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg twice daily in 203 children with asthma aged 4 to 11 years. At trial entry, the children were symptomatic on low doses of ICS (beclomethasone dipropionate 252 to 336 mcg/day; budesonide 200 to 400 mcg/day; flunisolide 1,000 mcg/day; triamcinolone acetonide 600 to 1,000 mcg/day; or fluticasone propionate 88 to 250 mcg/day). The primary objective of this trial was to determine the safety of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg compared with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder 100 mcg in this age group; however, the trial also included secondary efficacy measures of pulmonary function. Morning predose FEV<sub>1</sub> was obtained at baseline and Endpoint (last available FEV<sub>1</sub> result) in children aged 6 to 11 years. In subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, FEV<sub>1</sub> increased from 1.70 L at baseline (n = 79) to 1.88 L at Endpoint (n = 69) compared with an increase from 1.65 L at baseline (n = 83) to 1.77 L at Endpoint (n = 75) in subjects receiving fluticasone propionate 100 mcg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The findings of this trial, along with extrapolation of efficacy data from subjects aged 12 years and older, support the overall conclusion that fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg is efficacious in the treatment of asthma in subjects aged 4 to 11 years. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Serious Asthma-Related Events: </content>Two 26-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active comparator trials were conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder in adult and adolescent subjects (Trial 4, NCT01475721) and in pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years (Trial 5, NCT01462344). The primary safety objective of both trials was to evaluate whether the addition of salmeterol xinafoate to fluticasone propionate therapy (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder) was non-inferior to ICS fluticasone propionate in terms of the risk of a serious asthma-related event (hospitalization, endotracheal intubation, and death). The trials were designed to rule out pre-defined risk margins for serious asthma-related events of 2.0 for Trial 4 and 2.7 for Trial 5. A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma related.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Trial 4 enrolled subjects with moderate to severe persistent asthma with a history of asthma-related hospitalization or at least 1 asthma exacerbation in the previous year treated with systemic corticosteroids. A total of 11,679 adult and adolescent subjects [5,834 receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg, or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg and 5,845 receiving fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (100 mcg, 250 mcg, or 500 mcg)] were included. Trial 5 enrolled subjects with a diagnosis of asthma and a history of at least 1 asthma exacerbation in the previous year treated with systemic corticosteroid. A total of 6,208 subjects aged 4 to 11 years [3,107 receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 100 mcg/50 mcg or fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg and 3,101 receiving fluticasone propionate inhalation powder (100 mcg or 250 mcg)] were included. In both trials, subjects with life-threatening asthma were excluded. In Trials 4 and 5, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder was non-inferior to fluticasone propionate in terms of time to first serious asthma-related events based on the pre-specified risk margins, with estimated hazard ratios of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.66) and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.73, 2.27), respectively (Table 6).</paragraph>

In Trials 4 and 5, the hazard ratio for the time to first asthma exacerbation for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder relative to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.89) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.01), respectively. The difference in exacerbations was primarily driven by a reduction in those requiring systemic corticosteroids only.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg and fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg in the treatment of subjects with COPD was evaluated in 6 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials in adult subjects aged 40 years and older. These trials were primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder on lung function (3 trials), exacerbations (2 trials), and survival (1 trial).</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Lung Function</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two (2) of the 3 clinical trials primarily designed to evaluate the efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder on lung function were conducted in 1,414 subjects with COPD associated with chronic bronchitis. In these 2 trials, all the subjects had a history of cough productive of sputum that was not attributable to another disease process on most days for at least 3 months of the year for at least 2 years. The trials were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 24-week treatment duration. One (1) trial evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg compared with its components fluticasone propionate 250 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg and with placebo, and the other trial evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg compared with its components fluticasone propionate 500 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg and with placebo. Trial treatments were inhalation powders given as 1 inhalation from the dry powder inhaler twice daily. Maintenance COPD therapies were discontinued, with the exception of theophylline. The subjects had a mean pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> of 41% and 20% reversibility at trial entry. Percent reversibility was calculated as 100 times (FEV<sub>1</sub> post-albuterol minus FEV<sub>1</sub> pre-albuterol)/FEV<sub>1</sub> pre-albuterol.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Improvements in lung function (as defined by predose and postdose FEV<sub>1</sub>) were significantly greater with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder than with fluticasone propionate, salmeterol, or placebo. The improvement in lung function with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg was similar to the improvement seen with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Figures 4 and 5 display predose and 2-hour postdose, respectively, FEV<sub>1</sub> results for the trial with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg. To account for subject withdrawals during the trial, FEV<sub>1</sub> at Endpoint (last evaluable FEV<sub>1</sub>) was evaluated. Subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg had significantly greater improvements in predose FEV<sub>1</sub> at Endpoint (165 mL, 17%) compared with salmeterol 50 mcg (91 mL, 9%) and placebo (1 mL, 1%), demonstrating the contribution of fluticasone propionate to the improvement in lung function with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder (Figure 4). Subjects receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg had significantly greater improvements in postdose FEV<sub>1</sub> at Endpoint (281 mL, 27%) compared with fluticasone propionate 250 mcg  (147 mL, 14%) and placebo (58 mL, 6%), demonstrating the contribution of salmeterol to the improvement in lung function with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder (Figure 5).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The third trial was a 1-year trial that evaluated fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, and placebo in 1,465 subjects. The subjects had an established history of COPD and exacerbations, a pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;70% of predicted at trial entry, and 8.3% reversibility. The primary endpoint was the comparison of pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> in the groups receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg or placebo. Subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg had greater improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> (113 mL, 10%) compared with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg (7 mL, 2%), salmeterol (15 mL, 2%), and placebo (-60 mL, -3%). </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two (2) trials were primarily designed to evaluate the effect of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg on exacerbations. In these 2 trials, exacerbations were defined as worsening of 2 or more major symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence) or worsening of any 1 major symptom together with any 1 of the following minor symptoms: sore throat, colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion), fever without other cause, and increased cough or wheeze for at least 2 consecutive days. COPD exacerbations were considered of moderate severity if treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics was required and were considered severe if hospitalization was required.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Exacerbations were also evaluated as a secondary outcome in the 1- and 3-year trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg. There was not a symptomatic definition of exacerbation in these 2 trials. Exacerbations were defined in terms of severity requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids (moderately severe) or requiring hospitalization (severe).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The 2 exacerbation trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg were identical trials designed to evaluate the effect of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg and salmeterol 50 mcg, each given twice daily, on exacerbations of COPD over a 12-month period. A total of 1,579 subjects had an established history of COPD (but no other significant respiratory disorders). Subjects had a pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> of 33% of predicted, a mean reversibility of 23% at baseline, and a history of  ≥1 COPD exacerbation in the previous year that was moderate or severe. All subjects were treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg twice daily during a 4-week run-in period prior to being assigned trial treatment with twice-daily fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg or salmeterol 50 mcg. In both trials, treatment with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg resulted in a significantly lower annual rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations compared with salmeterol (30.5% reduction [95% CI: 17.0, 41.8], P&lt;0.001) in the first trial and (30.4% reduction [95% CI: 16.9, 41.7], P&lt;0.001) in the second trial. Subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg also had a significantly lower annual rate of exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids compared with subjects treated with salmeterol (39.7% reduction [95% CI: 22.8, 52.9], P&lt;0.001) in the first trial and (34.3% reduction [95% CI: 18.6, 47.0], P&lt;0.001) in the second trial. Secondary endpoints including pulmonary function and symptom scores improved more in subjects treated with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg than with salmeterol 50 mcg in both trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Exacerbations were evaluated in the 1- and the 3-year trials with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg as 1 of the secondary efficacy endpoints. In the 1-year trial, the group receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg had a significantly lower rate of moderate and severe exacerbations compared with placebo (25.4% reduction compared with placebo [95% CI: 13.5, 35.7]) but not when compared with its components (7.5% reduction compared with fluticasone propionate [95% CI: -7.3, 20.3] and 7% reduction compared with salmeterol [95% CI: -8.0, 19.9]). In the 3-year trial, the group receiving fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg had a significantly lower rate of moderate and severe exacerbations compared with each of the other treatment groups (25.1% reduction compared with placebo [95% CI: 18.6, 31.1], 9.0% reduction compared with fluticasone propionate [95% CI: 1.2, 16.2], and 12.2% reduction compared with salmeterol [95% CI: 4.6, 19.2]).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There were no trials conducted to directly compare the efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg on exacerbations. Across trials, the reduction in exacerbations seen with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg was not greater than the reduction in exacerbations seen with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 250 mcg/50 mcg.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A 3-year multicenter, international trial evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg compared with fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, and placebo on survival in 6,112 subjects with COPD. During the trial subjects were permitted usual COPD therapy with the exception of other ICS and long-acting bronchodilators. The subjects were aged 40 to 80 years with an established history of COPD, a pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;60% of predicted at trial entry, and &lt;10% of predicted reversibility. Each subject who withdrew from double-blind treatment for any reason was followed for the full 3-year trial period to determine survival status. The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality. Survival with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg was not significantly improved compared with placebo or the individual components (all-cause mortality rate 12.6% fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder versus 15.2% placebo). The rates for all-cause mortality were 13.5% and 16.0% in the groups treated with salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg, respectively. Secondary outcomes, including pulmonary function (post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>), improved with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, salmeterol 50 mcg, and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg compared with placebo. </paragraph>
