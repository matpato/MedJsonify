                           <br/>No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 mL/min). The recommended initial dose of ropinirole for patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis is 0.25 mg once daily. Further dose escalations should be based on tolerability and need for efficacy. The recommended maximum total daily dose is 3 mg/day in patients receiving regular dialysis. Supplemental doses after dialysis are not required. The use of ropinirole tablets in patients with severe renal impairment without regular dialysis has not been studied.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.1 Falling Asleep during Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients treated with ropinirole tablets have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including driving or operating machinery, which sometimes resulted in accidents. Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on ropinirole tablets, some perceived that they had no warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some have reported these events more than 1 year after initiation of treatment. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In controlled clinical trials, somnolence was commonly reported in patients receiving ropinirole tablets and was more frequent in Parkinson's disease (up to 40% ropinirole tablets, 6% placebo) than in Restless Legs Syndrome (12% ropinirole tablets, 6% placebo) <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in a setting of pre-existing somnolence, although patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness, especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. <content styleCode="italics">Â </content>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Before initiating treatment with ropinirole tablets, patients should be advised of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically asked about factors that may increase the risk with ropinirole tablets such as concomitant sedating medications or alcohol, the presence of sleep disorders (other than RLS), and concomitant medications that increase ropinirole plasma levels (e.g., ciprofloxacin) <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.1)]</content>. If a patient develops significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), ropinirole tablets should ordinarily be discontinued <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)]</content>. If a decision is made to continue ropinirole tablets, patients should be advised to not drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living<content styleCode="italics">. </content>

                        <paragraph>Syncope, sometimes associated with bradycardia, was observed in association withÂ  treatment withÂ  ropinirole in both patients with Parkinsonâs disease and patients with RLS. In controlled clinical trials in patients with Parkinsonâs disease, syncope was observed more frequently in patients receiving ropinirole tablets than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinsonâs disease without levodopa [L-dopa]: ropinirole tablets 12%, placebo 1%; advanced Parkinsonâs disease: ropinirole tablets 3%, placebo 2%). Syncope was reported in 1% of patients treated with ropinirole tablets for RLS in 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials compared with 0.2% of patients treated with placebo <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>. Most cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole tablets, and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because the trialsÂ conducted with Â ropinirole tablets excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, patients with significant cardiovascular disease should be treated with caution. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 4% of patients with Parkinsonâs disease enrolled in Phase 1 trials had syncope following a 1-mg dose of ropinirole tablets. In two trials in patients with RLS that used a forced-titration regimen and orthostatic challenge with intensive blood pressure monitoring, 2% of RLS patients treated with ropinirole tablets compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo reported syncope. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Phase 1 trials including healthy volunteers, the incidence of syncope was 2%. Of note, 1 subject with syncope developed hypotension, bradycardia, and sinus arrest; the subject recovered spontaneously without intervention. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients with Parkinsonâs disease may have impaired ability to respond normally to a fall in blood pressure after standing from lying down or seated position. Patients on ropinirole tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of the risk for syncope and hypotension <content styleCode="italics">[see Patient Counseling Information (17)]</content>.Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although the clinical trials were not designed to systematically monitor blood pressure, there were individual reported cases of orthostatic hypotension in early Parkinsonâs disease (without L-dopa) in patients treated with ropinirole tablets. Most of these cases occurred more than 4 weeks after initiation of therapy with ropinirole tablets and were usually associated with a recent increase in dose. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 12-week, placebo-controlled trials of patients with RLS, the adverse event orthostatic hypotension was reported by 4 of 496 patients (0.8%) treated with ropinirole tablets compared with 2 of 500 patients (0.4%) receiving placebo. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In two Phase 2 studies in patients with RLS, 14 of 55 patients (25%) receiving ropinirole tablets experienced an adverse event of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension compared with none of the 27 patients receiving placebo. In these studies, 11 of the 55 patients (20%) receiving ropinirole tablets and 3 of the 26 patients (12%) who had post-dose blood pressure assessments following placebo, experienced an orthostatic blood pressure decrease of at least 40 mm Hg systolic and/or at least 20 mm Hg diastolic. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Phase 1 trials of ropinirole tablets with healthy volunteers who received single doses on more than one occasion without titration, 7% had documented symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. These episodes appeared mainly at doses above 0.8 mg and these doses are higher than the starting doses recommended for patients with either Parkinsonâs disease or with RLS. In most of these individuals, the hypotension was accompanied by bradycardia but did not develop into syncope <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although dizziness is not a specific manifestation of hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, patients with hypotension or orthostatic hypotension frequently reported dizziness. In controlled clinical trials, dizziness was a common adverse reaction in patients receiving ropinirole tablets and was more frequent in patients with Parkinsonâs disease or with RLS receiving ropinirole tablets than in patients receiving placebo (early Parkinsonâs disease without L-dopa: ropinirole tablets 40%, placebo 22%; advanced Parkinsonâs disease: ropinirole tablets 26%, placebo 16%; RLS: ropinirole tablets 11%, placebo 5%). Dizziness of sufficient severity to cause trial discontinuation of ropinirole tablets was 4% in patients with early Parkinsonâs disease without L-dopa, 3% in patients with advanced Parkinsonâs disease, and 1% in patients with RLS <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. </content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-therapy trials in patients with Parkinsonâs disease who were not treated with L-dopa, 5.2% (8 of 157) of patients treated with ropinirole tablets Â reported hallucinations, compared with 1.4% of patients on placebo (2 of 147). Among those patients receiving both ropinirole tablets and L-dopa in advanced Parkinsonâs disease studies, 10.1% (21 of 208) were reported to experience hallucinations, compared with 4.2% (5 of 120) of patients treated with placebo and L-dopa. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The incidence of hallucination was increased in elderly patients (i.e., older than 65 years) treated with extended-release ropinirole tablets <content styleCode="italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Postmarketing reports indicate that patients with Parkinsonâs disease or RLS may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during treatment with ropinirole tablets or after starting or increasing the dose of ropinirole tablets. Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinsonâs disease or RLS can have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior can consist of one or more of a variety of manifestations including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, mania, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with ropinirole tablets because of the risk of exacerbating the psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinsonâs disease and may decrease the effectiveness of ropinirole tablets <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. </content>

                     <title>5.6 Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge or compulsive eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications, including ropinirole tablets, that increase central dopaminergic tone. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while being treated with ropinirole tablets for Parkinsonâs disease and RLS. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking ropinirole tablets. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Augmentation is a phenomenon in which dopaminergic medication causes a worsening of symptom severity above and beyond the level at the time the medication was started. The symptoms of augmentation may include the earlier onset of symptoms in the evening (or even the afternoon), increase in symptoms, and spread of symptoms to involve other extremities. Augmentation has been described during therapy for RLS. Rebound refers to new onset of symptoms in the early morning hours. Augmentation and/or early-morning rebound have been observed in a postmarketing trial of ropinirole tablets. If augmentation or early-morning rebound occurs, the use of ropinirole tablets should be reviewed and dosage adjustment or discontinuation of treatment should be considered. When discontinuing ropinirole tablets in patients with RLS, gradual reduction of the daily dose is recommended whenever possible <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration 2.3]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Retinal degeneration was observed in albino rats in the 2-year carcinogenicity study at all doses tested. The lowest dose tested 1.5 mg/kg/day the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for Parkinsonâs disease (24 mg/day) on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis. Retinal degeneration was not observed in a 3-month study in pigmented rats, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in albino mice, or in 1-year studies in monkeys or albino rats. The significance of this effect for humans has not been established, but involves disruption of a mechanism that is universally present in vertebrates (e.g., disk shedding). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ocular electroretinogram (ERG) assessments were conducted during a 2-year, double-blind, multicenter, flexible dose, L-dopaâcontrolled clinical trial of ropinirole in patients with Parkinsonâs disease; 156 patients (78 on ropinirole, mean dose: 11.9 mg/day, and 78 on L-dopa, mean dose: 555.2 mg/day) were evaluated for evidence of retinal dysfunction through electroretinograms. There was no clinically meaningful difference between the treatment groups in retinal function over the duration of the trial.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug (or of another development program of a different formulation of the same drug) and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>During the premarketing development of ropinirole tablets, patients received ropinirole tablets either without L-dopa (early Parkinsonâs disease trials) or as concomitant therapy with L-dopa (advanced Parkinsonâs disease trials). Because these two populations may have differential risks for various adverse reactions, this section will in general present adverse reaction data for these two populations separately. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with early-stage Parkinsonâs disease, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole tablets (incidence at least 5% greater than placebo) were nausea, somnolence, dizziness, syncope, asthenic condition (i.e., asthenia, fatigue, and/or malaise), viral infection, leg edema, vomiting, and dyspepsia. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Approximately 24% of patients treated with ropinirole tablets who participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled early Parkinsonâs disease (without L-dopa) trials discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 13% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in patients treated with ropinirole tablets (incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) of sufficient severity to cause discontinuation were nausea and dizziness. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 3 lists treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients with early Parkinsonâs disease (without L-dopa) treated with ropinirole tablets participating in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common than the incidence for placebo-treated patients. In these trials, either ropinirole tablets or placebo was used as early therapy (i.e., without L-dopa). </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In vitro metabolism studies showed that CYP1A2 is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. There is thus the potential for inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme to alter the clearance of ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole tablets, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole tablets may be required. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, increases the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of ropinirole <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. </content>Cigarette smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. </content>

                        <paragraph>There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of ropinirole tablets in pregnant women. In animal studies, ropinirole had adverse effects on development when administered to pregnant rats at doses similar to (neurobehavioral impairment) or greater than (teratogenicity and embryolethality at &gt;36 times) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) for Parkinsonâs disease. Ropinirole doses associated with teratogenicity and embryolethality in pregnant rats were associated with maternal toxicity. In pregnant rabbits, ropinirole potentiated the teratogenic effects of L-dopa when these drugs were administered in combination <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

                        <paragraph>Oral administration of ropinirole (0, 20, 60, 90, 120, or 150 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality, increased incidence of fetal malformations (digit, cardiovascular, and neural tube defects) and variations, and decreased fetal weight at the two highest doses. These doses were also associated with maternal toxicity. The highest no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development (90 mg/kg/day) is approximately 36 times the MRHD for Parkinsonâs disease (24 mg/day) on a body surface area (mg/m<sup>2</sup>) basis. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No effect on embryofetal development was observed in rabbits when ropinirole was administered alone during organogenesis at oral doses of 0, 1, 5, or 20 mg/kg/day (up to 16 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis). In pregnant rabbits, there was a greater incidence and severity of fetal malformations (primarily digit defects) when ropinirole (10 mg/kg/day) was administered orally during gestation in combination with L-dopa (250 mg/kg/day) than when L-dopa was administered alone. This drug combination was also associated with maternal toxicity. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of ropinirole (0, 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg/day) to rats during late gestation and continuing throughout lactation resulted in neurobehavioral impairment (decreased startle response) and decreased body weight in offspring at the highest dose. The no-effect dose of 1 mg/kg/day is less than the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis. </paragraph>

The precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinsonâs disease is unknown, although it is thought to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine D2 receptors within the caudate-putamen in the brain. The precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome is unknown, although it is thought to be related to its ability to stimulate dopamine receptors. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mechanism of orthostatic hypotension induced by ropinirole is presumed to be due to a D<sub>2</sub>-mediated blunting of the noradrenergic response to standing and subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Nausea is a common concomitant symptom of orthostatic signs and symptoms. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At oral doses as low as 0.2 mg, ropinirole suppressed serum prolactin concentrations in healthy male volunteers. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ropinirole had no dose-related effect on ECG wave form and rhythm in young, healthy, male volunteers in the range of 0.01 to 2.5 mg. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ropinirole had no dose-or exposure-related effect on mean QT intervals in healthy male and female volunteers titrated to doses up to 4 mg/day. The effect of ropinirole on QTc intervals at higher exposures achieved either due to drug interactions, hepatic impairment, or at higher doses has not been systematically evaluated. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ropinirole is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are N-despropylation and hydroxylation to form the inactive N-despropyl metabolite and hydroxy metabolites. The N-despropyl metabolite is converted to carbamyl glucuronide, carboxylic acid, and N-despropyl hydroxy metabolites. The hydroxy metabolite of ropinirole is rapidly glucuronidated. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies indicate that the major cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the metabolism of ropinirole is CYP1A2, an enzyme known to be induced by smoking and omeprazole and inhibited by, for example, fluvoxamine, mexiletine, and the older fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the treatment of Parkinsonâs disease was evaluated in a multinational drug development program consisting of 11 randomized, controlled trials. Four trials were conducted in patients with early Parkinsonâs disease and no concomitantÂ L-dopa and seven trials were conducted in patients with advanced Parkinsonâs disease with concomitant L-dopa. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Three placebo-controlled trials provide evidence of effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the management of patients with Parkinsonâs disease who were and were not receiving concomitant L-dopa. Two of these three trials enrolled patients with early Parkinsonâs disease (without L-dopa) and one enrolled patients receiving L-dopa. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these trials a variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment (e.g., the Unified Parkinsonâs Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS], Clinical Global Impression [CGI] scores, patient diaries recording time âonâ and âoff,â tolerability of L-dopa dose reductions). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In both trials of patients with early Parkinsonâs disease (without L-dopa), the motor component (Part III) of the UPDRS was the primary outcome assessment. The UPDRS is a multi-item rating scale intended to evaluate mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (Part II), motor performance (Part III), and complications of therapy (Part IV). Part III of the UPDRS contains 14 items designed to assess the severity of the cardinal motor findings in patients with Parkinsonâs disease (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability) scored for different body regions and has a maximum (worst) score of 108. In the trial of patients with advanced Parkinsonâs disease (with L-dopa), both reduction in percent awake time spent âoffâ and the ability to reduce the daily use of L-dopa were assessed as a combined endpoint and individually. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Trials in Patients with Early Parkinsonâs Disease (without L-dopa) </content>Â </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Trial 1 was a 12-week multicenter trial in which 63 patients with idiopathic Parkinsonâs disease receiving concomitant anti-Parkinson medication (but not L-dopa) were enrolled and 41 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 22 to placebo. Patients had a mean disease duration of approximately 2 years. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they presented with bradykinesia and at least tremor, rigidity, or postural instability. In addition, they must have been classified as Hoehn &amp; Yahr Stage I-IV. This scale, ranging from I = unilateral involvement with minimal impairment to V = confined to wheelchair or bed, is a standard instrument used for staging patients with Parkinsonâs disease. The primary outcome measure in this trial was the proportion of patients experiencing a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 30% in the UPDRS motor score. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were titrated for up to 10 weeks, starting at 0.5 mg twice daily, with weekly increments of 0.5 mg twice daily to a maximum of 5 mg twice daily. Once patients reached their maximally tolerated dose (or 5 mg twice daily), they were maintained on that dose through 12 weeks. The mean dose achieved by patients at trial endpoint was 7.4 mg/day. Mean baseline UPDRS motor score was 18.6 for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 19.9 for patients treated with placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 6). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Trial 2 in patients with early Parkinsonâs disease (without L-dopa) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial. In this trial, 241 patients were enrolled and 116 were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 125 to placebo. Patients were essentially similar to those in the trial described above; concomitant use of selegiline was allowed, but patients were not permitted to use anticholinergics or amantadine during the trial. Patients had a mean disease duration of 2 years and limited (not more than a 6-week period) or no prior exposure to L-dopa. The starting dosage of ropinirole tablets in this trial was 0.25 mg three times daily. The dosage was titrated at weekly intervals by increments of 0.25 mg three times daily to a dosage of 1 mg three times daily. Further titrations at weekly intervals were at increments of 0.5 mg three times daily up to a dosage of 3 mg three times daily, and then weekly at increments of 1 mg three times daily. Patients were to be titrated to a dosage of at least 1.5 mg three times daily and then to their maximally tolerated dosage, up to a maximum of 8 mg three times daily. The mean dose attained in patients at trial endpoint was 15.7 mg/day. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary measure of effectiveness was the mean percent reduction (improvement) from baseline in the UPDRS motor score. At the end of the 6-month trial, patients treated with ropinirole tablets showed improvement in motor score compared with placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 7). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Trial 3 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-month trial that randomized 149 patients (Hoehn &amp; Yahr II-IV) who were not adequately controlled on L-dopa. Ninety-five patients were randomized to ropinirole tablets and 54 were randomized to placebo. Patients in this trial had a mean disease duration of approximately 9 years, had been exposed to L-dopa for approximately 7 years, and had experienced âon-offâ periods with L-dopa therapy. Patients previously receiving stable doses of selegiline, amantadine, and/or anticholinergic agents could continue on these agents during the trial. Patients were started at a dosage of 0.25 mg three times daily of ropinirole tablets and titrated upward by weekly intervals until an optimal therapeutic response was achieved. The maximum dosage of trial medication was 8 mg three times daily. All patients had to be titrated to at least a dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily. Patients could then be maintained on this dosage level or higher for the remainder of the trial. Once a dosage of 2.5 mg three times daily was achieved, patients underwent a mandatory reduction in their L-dopa dosage, to be followed by additional mandatory reductions with continued escalation of the dosage of ropinirole tablets. Reductions in the dosage of L-dopa were also allowed if patients experienced adverse reactions that the investigator considered related to dopaminergic therapy. The mean dose attained at trial endpoint was 16.3 mg/day. The primary outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as patients who were able both to achieve a decrease (compared with baseline) of at least 20% in their L-dopa dosage and a decrease of at least 20% in the proportion of the time awake in the âoffâ condition (a period of time during the day when patients are particularly immobile), as determined by subject diary. In addition, the mean change in âoffâ time from baseline and the percent change from baseline in daily L-dopa dosage were examined. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At the end of 6 months, the percentage of responders was greater on ropinirole tablets than on placebo and the difference was statistically significant (Table 8). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Based on the protocol-mandated reductions in L-dopa dosage with escalating doses of ropinirole tablets, patients treated with ropinirole tablets had a 19.4% mean reduction in L-dopa dosage while patients treated with placebo had a 3% reduction. Mean daily L-dopa dosage at baseline was 759 mg for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 843 mg for patients treated with placebo. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean number of daily âoffâ hours at baseline was 6.4 hours for patients treated with ropinirole tablets and 7.3 hours for patients treated with placebo. At the end of the 6-month trial, there was a mean reduction of 1.5 hours of âoffâ time in patients treated with ropinirole tablets and a mean reduction of 0.9 hours of âoffâ time in patients treated with placebo, resulting in a treatment difference of 0.6 hours of âoffâ time.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Patients were required to have a history of a minimum of 15 RLS episodes/month during the previous month and a total score of â¥15 on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS scale) at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g., pregnancy, renal failure, anemia) were excluded. All trials employed flexible dosing, with patients initiating therapy at 0.25 mg ropinirole tablets once daily. Patients were titrated based on clinical response and tolerability over 7 weeks to a maximum of 4 mg once daily. All doses were taken between 1 and 3 hours before bedtime. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment, including the IRLS scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 being absence of RLS symptoms and 40 the most severe symptoms. Three of the controlled trials utilized the change from baseline in the IRLS scale at the Week 12 endpoint as the primary efficacy outcome. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Three hundred eighty patients were randomized to receive ropinirole tablets (n = 187) or placebo (n = 193) in a US trial (RLS-1); 284 were randomized to receive either ropinirole tablets (n = 146) or placebo (n = 138) in a multinational trial (excluding US) (RLS-2); and 267 patients were randomized to ropinirole tablets (n = 131) or placebo (n = 136) in a multinational trial (including US) (RLS-3). Across the three trials, the mean duration of RLS was 16 to 22 years (range: 0 to 65 years), mean age was approximately 54 years (range: 18 to 79 years), and approximately 61% were women. The mean dose at Week 12 was approximately 2 mg/day for the three trials. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At baseline, mean total IRLS score was 22 for ropinirole tablets and 21.6 for placebo in RLS-1, was 24.4 for ropinirole tablets and 25.2 for placebo in RLS-2, and was 23.6 for ropinirole tablets and 24.8 for placebo in RLS-3. In all three trials, a statistically significant difference between the treatment group receiving ropinirole tablets and the treatment group receiving placebo was observed at Week 12 for both the mean change from baseline in the IRLS scale total score and the percentage of patients rated as responders (much improved or very much improved) on the CGI-I (see Table 9).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long-term maintenance of efficacy in the treatment of RLS was demonstrated in a 36-week trial. Following a 24-week, single-blind treatment phase (flexible dosages of ropinirole tablets of 0.25 to 4 mg once daily), patients who were responders (defined as a decrease of &gt;6 points on the IRLS scale total score relative to baseline) were randomized in double-blind fashion to placebo or continuation of ropinirole tablets for an additional 12 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase of at least 6 points on the IRLS scale total score to a total score of at least 15, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. For patients who were responders at Week 24, the mean dose of ropinirole tablets were 2 mg (range: 0.25 to 4 mg). Patients continued on ropinirole tablets demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate compared with patients randomized to placebo (32.6% versus 57.8%, <content styleCode="italics">P </content>= 0.0156). </paragraph>

                     <br/>Alert patients to the potential sedating effects caused by ropinirole tablets, including somnolence and the possibility of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. Because somnolence is a frequent adverse reaction with potentially serious consequences, patients should not drive a car, operate machinery, or engage in other potentially dangerous activities until they have gained sufficient experience with ropinirole tablets to gauge whether or not it adverselyÂ  affects their mental and/or motor performance . Advise patients that if increased somnolence or episodes of falling asleep during activities of daily living (e.g., conversations, eating, driving a motor vehicle, etc.) are experienced at any time during treatment, they should not drive or participate in potentially dangerous activities until they have contacted their physician. <br/> Advise patients of possible additive effects when patients are taking other sedating medications, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, etc.) in combination with ropinirole tablets or when taking a concomitant medication (e.g., ciprofloxacin) that increases plasma levels of ropinirole<content styleCode="italics"> [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</content>

Hypotension and/or orthostatic symptoms may occur more frequently during initial therapy or with an increase in dose at any time (cases have been seen after weeks of treatment). Postural/orthostatic symptoms may be related to sitting up or standing.

You may suddenly fall asleep without being drowsy or without warning. This may result in having accidents. Your chances of falling asleep while doing normal activities while taking ropinirole tablets are greater if you take other medicines that cause drowsiness. Tell your healthcare provider right away if this happens. Before starting ropinirole tablets, be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you take any medicines that make you drowsy. <br/> â¢Â <content styleCode="bold">Fainting.</content> Fainting can happen, and sometimes your heart rate may be decreased.
