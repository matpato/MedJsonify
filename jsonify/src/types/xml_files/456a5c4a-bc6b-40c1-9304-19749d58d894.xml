                  <paragraph>Ethacrynate sodium, the sodium salt of ethacrynic acid, is soluble in water at 25Â°C to the extent of about 7 percent. Solutions of the sodium salt are relatively stable at about pH 7 at room temperature for short periods, but as the pH or temperature increases the solutions are less stable. The molecular weight of ethacrynate sodium is 325.12. Its molecular formula is C<sub>13</sub>H<sub>11</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>NaO<sub>4</sub> and its structural formula is:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Ethacrynic acid acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and on the proximal and distal tubules. Urinary output is usually dose dependent and related to the magnitude of fluid accumulation. Water and electrolyte excretion may be increased several times over that observed with thiazide diuretics, since ethacrynic acid inhibits reabsorption of a much greater proportion of filtered sodium than most other diuretic agents. Therefore, ethacrynic acid is effective in many patients who have significant degrees of renal insufficiency (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_warnings_id_396f5106-f364-433b-8652-eee0673d3f8e">WARNINGS</linkHtml> concerning deafness). Ethacrynic acid has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The electrolyte excretion pattern of ethacrynic acid varies from that of the thiazides and mercurial diuretics. Initial sodium and chloride excretion is usually substantial and chloride loss exceeds that of sodium. With prolonged administration, chloride excretion declines, and potassium and hydrogen ion excretion may increase. Ethacrynic acid is effective whether or not there is clinical acidosis or alkalosis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although ethacrynic acid, in carefully controlled studies in animals and experimental subjects, produces a more favorable sodium/potassium excretion ratio than the thiazides, in patients with increased diuresis excessive amounts of potassium may be excreted.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Onset of action is rapid, usually within 30 minutes after an oral dose of ethacrynic acid or within 5 minutes after an intravenous injection of ethacrynate sodium for injection. After oral use, diuresis peaks in about 2 hours and lasts about 6 to 8 hours.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The sulfhydryl binding propensity of ethacrynic acid differs somewhat from that of the organomercurials. Its mode of action is not by carbonic anhydrase inhibition.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ethacrynic acid does not cross the blood-brain barrier.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>All diuretics, including ethacrynic acid, are contraindicated in anuria. If increasing electrolyte imbalance, azotemia, and/or oliguria occur during treatment of severe, progressive renal disease, the diuretic should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a few patients this diuretic has produced severe, watery diarrhea. If this occurs, it should be discontinued and not used again.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Until further experience in infants is accumulated, therapy with oral and parenteral ethacrynic acid is contraindicated.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The effects of ethacrynic acid on electrolytes are related to its renal pharmacologic activity and are dose dependent. The possibility of profound electrolyte and water loss may be avoided by weighing the patient throughout the treatment period, by careful adjustment of dosage, by initiating treatment with small doses, and by using the drug on an intermittent schedule when possible. When excessive diuresis occurs, the drug should be withdrawn until homeostasis is restored. When excessive electrolyte loss occurs, the dosage should be reduced or the drug temporarily withdrawn.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Initiation of diuretic therapy with ethacrynic acid in the cirrhotic patient with ascites is best carried out in the hospital. When maintenance therapy has been established, the individual can be satisfactorily followed as an outpatient.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ethacrynic acid should be given with caution to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, particularly those with a history of previous episodes of electrolyte imbalance or hepatic encephalopathy. Like other diuretics it may precipitate hepatic coma and death.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Too vigorous a diuresis, as evidenced by rapid and excessive weight loss, may induce an acute hypotensive episode. In elderly cardiac patients, rapid contraction of plasma volume and the resultant hemoconcentration should be avoided to prevent the development of thromboembolic episodes, such as cerebral vascular thromboses and pulmonary emboli which may be fatal. Excessive loss of potassium in patients receiving digitalis glycosides may precipitate digitalis toxicity. Care should also be exercised in patients receiving potassium-depleting steroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A number of possibly drug-related deaths have occurred in critically ill patients refractory to other diuretics. These generally have fallen into two categories: (1) patients with severe myocardial disease who have been receiving digitalis and presumably developed acute hypokalemia with fatal arrhythmia; (2) patients with severely decompensated hepatic cirrhosis with ascites, with or without accompanying encephalopathy, who were in electrolyte imbalance and died because of intensification of the electrolyte defect.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo with a sense of fullness in the ears have occurred, most frequently in patients with severe impairment of renal function. These symptoms have been associated most often with intravenous administration and with doses in excess of those recommended. The deafness has usually been reversible and of short duration (1 to 24 hours). However, in some patients the hearing loss has been permanent. A number of these patients were also receiving drugs known to be ototoxic. Ethacrynic acid may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_interactions_id_10d35644-a229-462d-8ecb-cc31ab7afa78">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics (see <linkHtml href="#i4i_interactions_id_10d35644-a229-462d-8ecb-cc31ab7afa78">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Weakness, muscle cramps, paresthesias, thirst, anorexia, and signs of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and/or hypochloremic alkalosis may occur following vigorous or excessive diuresis and these may be accentuated by rigid salt restriction. Rarely, tetany has been reported following vigorous diuresis. <content styleCode="italics">During therapy with ethacrynic acid, liberalization of salt intake and supplementary potassium chloride are often necessary.</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When a metabolic alkalosis may be anticipated, e.g., in cirrhosis with ascites, the use of potassium chloride or a potassium-sparing agent before and during therapy with ethacrynic acid may mitigate or prevent the hypokalemia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Loop diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of ethacrynic acid in hypertension have not been established. However, the dosage of coadministered antihypertensive agents may require adjustment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Orthostatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving other antihypertensive agents when given ethacrynic acid.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ethacrynic acid has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis. A transient increase in serum urea nitrogen may occur. Usually, this is readily reversible when the drug is discontinued.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with other diuretics used in the treatment of renal edema, hypoproteinemia may reduce responsiveness to ethacrynic acid and the use of salt-poor albumin should be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ethacrynic acid may increase the risk of gastric hemorrhage associated with corticosteroid treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Read circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Ethacrynic acid may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as aminoglycoside and some cephalosporin antibiotics. Their concurrent use should be avoided.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when ethacrynic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>The smallest dose required to produce gradual weight loss (about 1 to 2 pounds per day) is recommended. Onset of diuresis usually occurs at 50 mg to 100 mg for adults. After diuresis has been achieved, the minimally effective dose (usually from 50 mg to 200 mg daily) may be given on a continuous or intermittent dosage schedule. Dosage adjustments are usually in 25 mg to 50 mg increments to avoid derangement of water and electrolyte excretion.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>The patient should be weighed under standard conditions before and during the institution of diuretic therapy with this compound. Small alterations in dose should effectively prevent a massive diuretic response. The following schedule may be helpful in determining the smallest effective dose.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Day 1 â 50 mg once daily after a meal</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Day 2 â 50 mg twice daily after meals, if necessary</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Day 3 â 100 mg in the morning and 50 mg to 100 mg following the afternoon or evening meal, depending upon response to the morning dose.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>A few patients may require initial and maintenance doses as high as 200 mg twice daily. These higher doses, which should be achieved gradually, are most often required in patients with severe, refractory edema.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>It is usually possible to reduce the dosage and frequency of administration once dry weight has been achieved.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Ethacrynic acid may be given intermittently after an effective diuresis is obtained with the regimen outlined above.Dosage may be on an alternate daily schedule or more prolonged periods of diuretic therapy may be interspersed with rest periods. Such an intermittent dosage schedule allows time for correction of any electrolyte imbalance and may provide a more efficient diuretic response.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The chloruretic effect of this agent may give rise to retention of bicarbonate and a metabolic alkalosis. This may be corrected by giving chloride (ammonium chloride or arginine chloride). Ammonium chloride should not be given to cirrhotic patients. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Ethacrynic acid has additive effects when used with other diuretics. For example, a patient who is on maintenance dosage of an oral diuretic may require additional intermittent diuretic therapy, such as an organomercurial, for the maintenance of basal weight. The intermittent use of ethacrynic acid orally may eliminate the need for injections of organomercurials. Small doses of ethacrynic acid may be added to existing diuretic regimens to maintain basal weight. This drug may potentiate the action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, with augmentation of natriuresis and kaliuresis. Therefore, when adding ethacrynic acid, the initial dose and changes of dose should be in 25 mg increments, to avoid electrolyte depletion. Rarely, patients who failed to respond to ethacrynic acid have responded to older established agents.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>While many patients do not require supplemental potassium, the use of potassium chloride or potassium-sparing agents, or both, during treatment with ethacrynic acid is advisable, especially in cirrhotic or nephrotic patients and in patients receiving digitalis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Salt liberalization usually prevents the development of hyponatremia and hypochloremia. During treatment with ethacrynic acid, salt may be liberalized to a greater extent than with other diuretics. Cirrhotic patients, however, usually require at least moderate salt restriction concomitant with diuretic therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The usual intravenous dose for the average sized adult is 50 mg, or 0.5 mg to 1 mg per kg of body weight. Usually only one dose has been necessary; occasionally a second dose at a new injection site, to avoid possible thrombophlebitis, may be required. A single intravenous dose not exceeding 100 mg has been used in critical situations.</paragraph>

Occasionally, some 5 percent Dextrose Injection solutions may have a low pH (below 5). The resulting solution with such a diluent may be hazy or opalescent. Intravenous use of such a solution is not recommended. Inspect the vial containing intravenous ethacrynate sodium for injection for particulate matter and discoloration before use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The solution may be given slowly through the tubing of a running infusion or by direct intravenous injection over a period of several minutes.
