                        <paragraph>Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion (2.1): 
    <br/>  Prior to initiating treatment with Acetylcysteine injection, decide whether the three-bag or two-bag regimen will be used. 
    <br/>  Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. 
    <br/>  • If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: 
    <br/>  o Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately. 
    <br/>  o Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. 
    <br/>  • If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: 
    <br/>  o Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of two doses over 20 hours or three doses over 21 hours (2.5). 
    <br/>  • If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: 
    <br/>  o Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection immediately 
    <br/>  o Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment 
    <br/>  • If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: 
    <br/>  o Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with Acetylcysteine injection (2.2)

                           <br/>  • Calculate the dose (mg) based on the patient’s weight in kg; multiple vials of Acetylcysteine injection may be required. 
    <br/>  o Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2,600 mOsmol/L), therefore Acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids.

    <br/>  • It is not known whether the two-bag regimen is comparable to the three-bag regimen in preventing hepatotoxicity. 
    <br/>  • Patients 40 kg or less should receive the three-bag regimen. 
    <br/>  • For patients weighing 41 kg or greater, the three-bag regimen may be preferred for those with early signs of severe liver injury or a large acetaminophen ingestion.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>1. Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>   • The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>2. Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose, and electrolytes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>3. Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. The critical ingestion-treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 and 8 hours. Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post-ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy. However, it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld, since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct. 
  <br/>  If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours: 
  <br/>     • Refer to the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram (see Figure 1) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with Acetylcysteine injection. 
  <br/>     • Initiation of Acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient. 
  <br/>  The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs (e.g., isoniazid), and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range.

                           <br/>  For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the “possible” treatment line (dotted line in nomogram): 
  <br/>     • Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</content>. 
  <br/>  For patients with an acute overdose from an extended-release acetaminophen, if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible tretement line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion. If the second value is at or above the “possible” tretement line (dotted line in nomogram): 
  <br/>     • Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</content>. 
  <br/>  For patients whose values are below the “possible” tretement line, but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion: 
  <br/>     • Administer a loading dose of Acetylcysteine injection
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]</content>. 
  <br/>  For patients whose values are below the “possible” treatement line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion, do not administer Acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity.

                        <paragraph>Because Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar (2,600 mOsmol/L), Acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection (1/2 normal saline), or 5% dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration. The total injection volume will vary based on the patients weight and chosen dosage regimen (i.e., three-bag or two-bag)
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]</content>.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The choice of diluent should be based on the individual patients clinical status, concurrent medical conditions, and institutional protocols. The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection. However, consider 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection if sodium load is a concern for the patient. 
  <br/>  Dilution of Acetylcysteine injection in each of these three solution results in different osmolarity of the acetylcysteine solution for intravenous administration (see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the Acetylcysteine injection concentration).

The treating clinician should assess each case individually and consult with their pharmacy if there are any concerns about the appropriate diluent choice. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent, as it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids than 5% dextrose in water or sterile water for injection.</paragraph>

The color of the diluted solution range from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured (the color change does not affect the quality of the product).

  <br/>  It is not known whether the two-bag regimen is comparable to the three-bag regimen for efficacy in preventing hepatotoxicity. 
  <br/>  There are insufficient data to recommend use of the two-bag regimen in patients 40 kg or less; these patients should receive the three-bag regimen. 
  <br/>  For patients weighing 41 kg or greater, the clinician should consider the following factors when deciding whether to select the three-bag or two-bag regimen:

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion (RSI) is an ingestion of acetaminophen at dosages higher than those recommended for extended periods of time. The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion (i.e., the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram) do not apply to patients with RSI.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Therefore, obtain the following information to guide Acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI:</paragraph>

                           <item>Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations. A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy.</item>

  <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6)]</content>. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately stop the infusion of Acetylcysteine injection and initiate appropriate treatment. 
  <br/>  Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of Acetylcysteine injection therapy and throughout Acetylcysteine injection therapy.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously. These  reactions  usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine. If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin, it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of antihistaminic drugs. The Acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated and acute symptoms have resolved; however, if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re-initiation of treatment or increases in severity, Acetylcysteine injection should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A large multi-center study was performed in Canada where data were collected from patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose between 1980 and 2005. This study evaluated 4709 adult cases and 1905 pediatric cases. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in adult (overall incidence 8%) and pediatric (overall incidence 10%) patients is presented in Tables 5 and 6.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Fatal and life-threatening adverse events have been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage, including anaphylaxis, cerebral edema, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Stop acetylcysteine administration in the setting of suspected acetylcysteine overdosage and manage as clinically indicated.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Anaphylaxis, including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced anaphylaxis following acetylcysteine overdosage often became symptomatic during the loading dose and experienced hypotension, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm, or respiratory distress. Cases of anaphylaxis with acetylcysteine overdosage also described coagulopathy, renal failure, or respiratory failure.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Cerebral edema, including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced cerebral edema following acetylcysteine overdose presented with altered mental status, abnormal pupillary responses, seizures. Some cases of cerebral edema with acetylcysteine overdosage described brain herniation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>HUS has been reported following acetylcysteine overdosage. Patients who experienced HUS presented with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Removal of acetylcysteine via hemodialysis has been reported in the literature outside of the context of acetylcysteine overdosage. Studies of hemodialysis in acetaminophen overdose report significant extracorporeal removal of acetylcysteine during hemodialysis.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Acetylcysteine injection is an intravenous antidote for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. Acetylcysteine is the nonproprietary name for the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine (N-acetyl-L cysteine,). The compound is a white crystalline powder, which melts in the range of 104° to 110°C and has a very slight odor. 
  <br/>  The molecular formula of the compound is C
 
  <sub>5</sub>H
 
  <sub>9</sub>NO
 
  <sub>3</sub>S, and its molecular weight is 163.2. Acetylcysteine has the following structural formula:

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Acetylcysteine injection is supplied as a sterile solution in vials containing 20% w/v (200 mg/mL) acetylcysteine. The pH of the solution ranges from 6.0 to 7.5. Acetylcysteine injection contains the following inactive ingredients: sodium hydroxide (used for pH adjustment), Disodium Edetate Dihydrate and Water for Injection, USP.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The amount of sodium in Acetylcysteine injection is approximately 30 mg/mL. Because Acetylcysteine injection is administered based on a patient’s weight, the amount of sodium administered in a course of treatment will vary from approximately 225 mg to 4500 mg. The use of ½ normal saline will contribute approximately an additional 1770 mg of sodium per liter of diluent.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg/kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels, or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with, and thus detoxification of, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen.</paragraph>

The reversibility of this effect was not evaluated. No effects on fertility were observed in female rats at intravenous doses up to 300 mg/kg/day (0.2 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area), or in male rats at intravenous doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day.

                  <paragraph>A randomized, open-label, multi-center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose. One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15-minute infusion rate and seventy-one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate. The loading dose was 150 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg/kg over 16 hours. Of the 180 patients, 27% were male and 73% were female. Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years, with the mean age being 30 years (
 
  <content styleCode="underline">+</content>13.0).

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>A subgroup of 58 subjects (33 in the 15-minute infusion group; 25 in the 60-minute infusion group) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion. No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup; however, with 95% confidence, the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0% to 9% for the 15-minute infusion group and from 0% to 12% for the 60-minute infusion group.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>An open-label, observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16-year period. Of the 1749 patients, 65% were female, 34% were male and less than 1% was transgender. Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years, with 72% of the patients falling in the 16- to 40-year-old age bracket. A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment. A post-hoc analysis identified 56 patients who (1) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity (APAP greater than 150 mg/L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram) and (2) had a liver function test. Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20-21 hours) within 8 hours, two (4%) developed hepatotoxicity (AST or ALT greater than 1000 U/L). Twenty-one of 48 (44%) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity. The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here. For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose, only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined. Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients (less than 16 years of age) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen, of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine. There were no deaths of pediatric patients. None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity. The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="underline"/>A multi-center, observational, retrospective cohort study investigated rates of hypersensitivity reactions in 493 patients treated with a two-bag intravenous acetylcysteine regimen compared to 274 patients treated with a three-bag regimen in Denmark between January 2012 and December 2014. The two-bag regimen consisted of a 4 hour loading dose at 200 mg/kg followed by a 16 hour infusion at 100 mg/kg. The three-bag regimen used a 150 mg/kg loading dose administered over 15 minutes, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours and a final dose of 100 mg/kg for 16 hours. Patients in this study were treated with acetylcysteine regardless of plasma acetaminophen concentration. The median (range) serum acetaminophen concentration at presentation was &lt;1 mcg/mL (0-353 mcg/mL) in the total study population, and only 12/767 patients (1.6%) had a serum acetaminophen level that would have warranted acetylcysteine treatment based on the revised Rumack-Mathew nomogram.

                  <paragraph>Hepatotoxicity was defined as peak ALT &gt;1,000 U/L at any point during hospitalization. In this population that was low-risk for hepatotoxicity based on median acetaminophen level at presentation, no differences were observed in unadjusted hepatotoxicity rates between patients who received the two-bag regimen (4%, 20/493) compared to patients who received the three-bag regimen (4%, 11/274). However, this study has significant limitations and was not designed to establish non-inferiority.</paragraph>
