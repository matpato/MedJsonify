                        <paragraph>Teriparatide Injection should be administered initially under circumstances in which the patient can sit or lie down if symptoms of orthostatic hypotension occur. In short-term clinical pharmacology studies of Teriparatide Injection in healthy volunteers, transient episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension were observed in 5% of volunteers. Typically, these events began within 4 hours of dosing and resolved (without treatment) within a few minutes to a few hours. When transient orthostatic hypotension occurred, it happened within the first several doses, it was relieved by placing the person in a reclining position, and it did not preclude continued treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of Teriparatide Injection in the treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women was assessed in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 1382 patients (21% men, 79% women) aged 28 to 86 years (mean 67 years) <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_8e7227e6-46fe-42ed-8bb2-a07cf7513bf4">14.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_be61396b-dc44-4814-8bfa-1665811050d7">14.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. The median durations of the trials were 11 months for men and 19 months for women, with 691 patients exposed to Teriparatide Injection and 691 patients to placebo. All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus at least 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the Teriparatide Injection group and 1% in the placebo group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 16% in the Teriparatide Injection group and 19% in the placebo group. Early discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 7% in the Teriparatide Injection group and 6% in the placebo group.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of Teriparatide Injection in the treatment of men and women with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of 428 patients (19% men, 81% women) aged 22 to 89 years (mean 57 years) treated with â¥5 mg per day prednisone or equivalent for a minimum of 3 months <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_741c1111-b2e3-4f59-a925-fc22913f09a8">14.3</linkHtml>)]</content>. The duration of the trial was 18 months with 214 patients exposed to Teriparatide Injection and 214 patients exposed to an oral daily bisphosphonate (active control). All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There was no increase in mortality in the Teriparatide Injection group compared to the active control group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 21% in Teriparatide Injection patients and 18% in active control patients, and included pneumonia (3% Teriparatide Injection, 1% active control). Early discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 15% of Teriparatide Injection patients and 12% of active control patients, and included dizziness (2% Teriparatide Injection, 0% active control).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse events reported at a higher incidence in the Teriparatide Injection group and with at least a 2% difference in Teriparatide Injection-treated patients compared with active control-treated patients were: nausea (14%, 7%), gastritis (7%, 3%), pneumonia (6%, 3%), dyspnea (6%, 3%), insomnia (5%, 1%), anxiety (4%, 1%), and herpes zoster (3%, 1%), respectively.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>As with all peptides, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other teriparatide products may be misleading.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the clinical trial of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_8e7227e6-46fe-42ed-8bb2-a07cf7513bf4">14.1</linkHtml>)]</content>, antibodies that cross reacted with teriparatide were detected in 3% of women (15/541) who received Teriparatide Injection. Generally, antibodies were first detected following 12 months of treatment and diminished after withdrawal of therapy. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity reactions among these patients. Antibody formation did not appear to have effects on serum calcium, or on bone mineral density (BMD) response.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two osteosarcoma surveillance safety studies (U.S. claims-based database studies) were designed to obtain data on the incidence rate of osteosarcoma among Teriparatide Injection-treated patients. In these two studies, three and zero osteosarcoma cases were identified among 379,283 and 153,316 Teriparatide Injection users, respectively. The study results suggest a similar risk for osteosarcoma between Teriparatide Injection users and their comparators. However, the interpretation of the study results calls for caution owing to the limitations of the data sources which do not allow for complete measurement and control for confounders.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no available data on Teriparatide Injection use in pregnant women to evaluate for drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Consider discontinuing Teriparatide Injection when pregnancy is recognized.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, teriparatide increased skeletal deviations and variations in mouse offspring at subcutaneous doses equivalent to more than 60 times the recommended 20 mcg human daily dose (based on body surface area, mcg/m<sup>2</sup>), and produced mild growth retardation and reduced motor activity in rat offspring at subcutaneous doses equivalent to more than 120 times the human dose (see <content styleCode="italics">Data</content>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. The background risk in the US general population of major birth defects is 2% to 4% and of miscarriage is 15% to 20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, pregnant mice received teriparatide during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses equivalent to 8 to 267 times the human dose (based on body surface area, mcg/m<sup>2</sup>). At subcutaneous doses â¥60 times the human dose, the fetuses showed an increased incidence of skeletal deviations or variations (interrupted rib, extra vertebra or rib). When pregnant rats received teriparatide during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses 16 to 540 times the human dose, the fetuses showed no abnormal findings.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a perinatal/postnatal study in pregnant rats dosed subcutaneously from organogenesis through lactation, mild growth retardation was observed in female offspring at doses â¥120 times the human dose. Mild growth retardation in male offspring and reduced motor activity in both male and female offspring were observed at maternal doses of 540 times the human dose. There were no developmental or reproductive effects in mice or rats at doses 8 or 16 times the human dose, respectively.</paragraph>

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Endogenous 84-amino acid parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include regulation of bone metabolism, renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, and intestinal calcium absorption. The biological actions of PTH and teriparatide are mediated through binding to specific high-affinity cell-surface receptors. Teriparatide and the 34 N-terminal amino acids of PTH bind to these receptors with the same affinity and have the same physiological actions on bone and kidney. Teriparatide is not expected to accumulate in bone or other tissues.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The skeletal effects of teriparatide depend upon the pattern of systemic exposure. Once-daily administration of teriparatide stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and cortical (periosteal and/or endosteal) bone surfaces by preferential stimulation of osteoblastic activity over osteoclastic activity. In monkey studies, teriparatide improved trabecular microarchitecture and increased bone mass and strength by stimulating new bone formation in both cancellous and cortical bone. In humans, the anabolic effects of teriparatide manifest as an increase in skeletal mass, an increase in markers of bone formation and resorption, and an increase in bone strength. By contrast, continuous excess of endogenous PTH, as occurs in hyperparathyroidism, may be detrimental to the skeleton because bone resorption may be stimulated more than bone formation.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Serum Calcium Concentrations</content> - When teriparatide 20 mcg was administered once daily, the serum calcium concentration increased transiently, beginning approximately 2 hours after dosing and reaching a maximum concentration between 4 and 6 hours (median increase, 0.4 mg/dL). The serum calcium concentration began to decline approximately 6 hours after dosing and returned to baseline by 16 to 24 hours after each dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a clinical study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the median peak serum calcium concentration measured 4 to 6 hours after dosing with Teriparatide Injection (20 mcg subcutaneous once daily) was 9.68 mg/dL at 12 months. The peak serum calcium remained below 11 mg/dL in &gt;99% of women at each visit. Sustained hypercalcemia was not observed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this study, 11.1% of women treated with Teriparatide Injection had at least 1 serum calcium value above the upper limit of normal (ULN) (10.6 mg/dL) compared with 1.5% of women treated with placebo. The percentage of women treated with Teriparatide Injection whose serum calcium was above the ULN on consecutive 4- to 6-hour post-dose measurements was 3% compared with 0.2% of women treated with placebo. In these women, calcium supplements and/or Teriparatide Injection doses were reduced. The timing of these dose reductions was at the discretion of the investigator. Teriparatide Injection dose adjustments were made at varying intervals after the first observation of increased serum calcium (median 21 weeks). During these intervals, there was no evidence of progressive increases in serum calcium.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a clinical study of men with either primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis, the effects on serum calcium were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women. The median peak serum calcium concentration measured 4 to 6 hours after dosing with Teriparatide Injection was 9.44 mg/dL at 12 months. The peak serum calcium remained below 11 mg/dL in 98% of men at each visit. Sustained hypercalcemia was not observed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In this study, 6% of men treated with Teriparatide Injection daily had at least 1 serum calcium value above the ULN (10.6 mg/dL) compared with none of the men treated with placebo. The percentage of men treated with Teriparatide Injection whose serum calcium was above the ULN on consecutive measurements was 1.3% (2 men) compared with none of the men treated with placebo.

Data on biochemical markers of bone turnover were available for the first 12 months of treatment. Peak concentrations of PICP at 1 month of treatment were approximately 41% above baseline, followed by a decline to near-baseline values by 12 months. BSAP concentrations increased by 1 month of treatment and continued to rise more slowly from 6 through 12 months. The maximum increases of BSAP were 45% above baseline in women and 23% in men. After discontinuation of therapy, BSAP concentrations returned toward baseline. The increases in formation markers were accompanied by secondary increases in the markers of bone resorption: urinary N-telopeptide (NTX) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD), consistent with the physiological coupling of bone formation and resorption in skeletal remodeling. Changes in BSAP, NTX, and DPD were lower in men than in women, possibly because of lower systemic exposure to teriparatide in men.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in Fischer 344 rats. In the first study, male and female rats were given daily subcutaneous teriparatide injections of 5, 30, or 75 mcg/kg/day for 24 months from 2 months of age. These doses resulted in rat systemic exposures that were 3, 20, and 60 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans, respectively, following a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg (based on AUC comparison). Teriparatide treatment resulted in a marked dose-related increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma, a rare malignant bone tumor, in both male and female rats. Osteosarcomas were observed at all doses and the incidence reached 40% to 50% in the high-dose groups. Teriparatide also caused a dose-related increase in osteoblastoma and osteoma in both sexes. No osteosarcomas, osteoblastomas or osteomas were observed in untreated control rats. The bone tumors in rats occurred in association with a large increase in bone mass and focal osteoblast hyperplasia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The second 2-year study was carried out in order to determine the effect of treatment duration and animal age on the development of bone tumors. Female rats were treated for different periods between 2 and 26 months of age with subcutaneous teriparatide doses of 5 and 30 mcg/kg (equivalent to 3 and 20 times the human exposure at the 20-mcg dose, respectively, based on AUC comparison). The study showed that the occurrence of osteosarcoma, osteoblastoma and osteoma was dependent upon dose and duration of teriparatide exposure. Bone tumors were observed when immature 2-month old rats were treated with 30 mcg/kg/day of teriparatide for 24 months or with 5 or 30 mcg/kg/day of teriparatide for 6 months. Bone tumors were also observed when mature 6-month old rats were treated with 30 mcg/kg/day of teriparatide for 6 or 20 months. Tumors were not detected when mature 6-month old rats were treated with 5 mcg/kg/day of teriparatide for 6 or 20 months. The results did not demonstrate a difference in susceptibility to bone tumor formation, associated with teriparatide treatment, between mature and immature rats. </paragraph>

Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of once-daily Teriparatide Injection, median exposure of 19 months, were examined in a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical study of 1637 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In this study 541 postmenopausal women were treated with 20 mcg Teriparatide Injection subcutaneously once daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All women received 1000 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D per day. Baseline and endpoint spinal radiographs were evaluated using the semiquantitative scoring. Ninety percent of the women in the study had 1 or more radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures at baseline. The primary efficacy endpoint was the occurrence of new radiographically diagnosed vertebral fractures defined as changes in the height of previously undeformed vertebrae. Such fractures are not necessarily symptomatic.</paragraph>

This difference was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001); the absolute reduction in risk was 9.3% and the relative reduction was 65%. Teriparatide Injection was effective in reducing the risk for vertebral fractures regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, or baseline BMD (<content styleCode="italics">see</content> Table 2).</paragraph>

Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of once-daily Teriparatide Injection, median exposure of 10 months, were examined in a double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical study of 437 men with either primary (idiopathic) or hypogonadal osteoporosis. In this study, 151 men received 20 mcg of Teriparatide Injection given subcutaneously once daily. All men received 1000 mg of calcium and at least 400 IU of vitamin D per day. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in lumbar spine BMD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Teriparatide Injection increased lumbar spine BMD in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis. Statistically significant increases were seen at 3 months and continued throughout the treatment period. Teriparatide Injection was effective in increasing lumbar spine BMD regardless of age, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD. The effects of Teriparatide Injection at additional skeletal sites are shown in Table 4.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Teriparatide Injection treatment for a median of 10 months increased lumbar spine BMD from baseline in 94% of men treated. Fifty-three percent of patients treated with Teriparatide Injection achieved at least a 5% increase in spine BMD, and 14% gained 10% or more.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.3 Treatment of Men and
Women with Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of Teriparatide Injection for treating glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of 428 patients (19% men, 81% women) aged 22 to 89 years (mean 57 years) treated with â¥5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent for a minimum of 3 months. The duration of the trial was 18 months. In the trial 214 patients were treated with Teriparatide Injection 20 mcg given subcutaneously once daily. In the Teriparatide Injection group, the baseline median glucocorticoid dose was 7.5 mg/day and the baseline median duration of glucocorticoid use was 1.5 years. The mean (SD) baseline lumbar spine BMD was 0.85 Â± 0.13 g/cm<sup>2</sup> and lumbar spine BMD T-score was â2.5 Â± 1 (number of standard deviations below the mean BMD value for healthy adults). A total of 30% of patients had prevalent vertebral fracture(s) and 43% had prior non-vertebral fracture(s). The patients had chronic rheumatologic, respiratory or other diseases that required sustained glucocorticoid therapy. All patients received 1000 mg of calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of differences in mechanism of action (anabolic vs. anti-resorptive) and lack of clarity regarding differences in BMD as an adequate predictor of fracture efficacy, data on the active comparator are not presented.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, Teriparatide Injection increased lumbar spine BMD compared with baseline at 3 months through 18 months of treatment. In patients treated with Teriparatide Injection, the mean percent change in BMD from baseline to endpoint was 7.2% at the lumbar spine, 3.6% at the total hip, and 3.7% at the femoral neck (p &lt;0.001 all sites). The relative treatment effects of Teriparatide Injection were consistent in subgroups defined by gender, age, geographic region, body mass index, underlying disease, prevalent vertebral fracture, baseline glucocorticoid dose, prior bisphosphonate use, and glucocorticoid discontinuation during trial.</paragraph>
