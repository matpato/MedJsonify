                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Levetiracetam extended-release tablets dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this, an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>                 [140-age (years)] x weight (kg) 
  <br/>  CLcr =   ----------------------------------------------   (x
 
  <sup/>0.85 for female patients) 
  <br/>                   72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL) 
  <br/>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Then CLcr is adjusted for body surface area (BSA) as follows:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>                                                 CLcr (mL/min) 
  <br/>  CLcr (mL/min/1.73m
 
  <sup>2</sup>) =    -----------------------------    x 1.73

                           <br/>  A total of 7% of levetiracetam extended-release-treated patients experienced non-psychotic behavioral disorders (reported as irritability and aggression) compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Irritability was reported in 7% of levetiracetam extended-release-treated patients. Aggression was reported in 1% of levetiracetam extended-release-treated patients.

                        <paragraph>No patient discontinued treatment or had a dose reduction as a result of these adverse reactions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The number of patients exposed to levetiracetam extended-release tablets was considerably smaller than the number of patients exposed to immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in controlled trials. Therefore, certain adverse reactions observed in the immediate-release levetiracetam controlled trials will likely occur in patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  A total of 13% of adult patients and 38% of pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age) treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets experienced non-psychotic behavioral symptoms (reported as aggression, agitation, anger, anxiety, apathy, depersonalization, depression, emotional lability, hostility, hyperkinesias, irritability, nervousness, neurosis, and personality disorder), compared to 6% and 19% of adult and pediatric patients on placebo. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets as adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age). An exploratory analysis suggested a worsening in aggressive behavior in patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in that study

                        <paragraph>A total of 1.7% of adult patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets discontinued treatment due to behavioral adverse reactions, compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. The treatment dose was reduced in 0.8% of adult patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam, compared to 0.5% of placebo-treated patients. Overall, 11% of pediatric patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam experienced behavioral symptoms associated with discontinuation or dose reduction, compared to 6.2% of placebo-treated pediatric patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>One percent of adult patients and 2% of pediatric patients (4 to 16 years of age) treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets experienced psychotic symptoms, compared to 0.2% and 2%, respectively, in adult and placebo-treated pediatric patients. In the controlled study that assessed the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age, 1.6% levetiracetam-treated patients experienced paranoia, compared to no placebo-treated patients. There were 3.1% patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam who experienced confusional state, compared to no placebo-treated patients

                     <title>5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including levetiracetam extended-release tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Anyone considering prescribing levetiracetam extended-release tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Levetiracetam extended-release tablets can cause anaphylaxis or angioedema after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Signs and symptoms in cases reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with levetiracetam have included hypotension, hives, rash, respiratory distress, and swelling of the face, lip, mouth, eye, tongue, throat, and feet. In some reported cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema, levetiracetam extended-release tablets should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical attention. Levetiracetam extended-release tablets should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in patients treated with levetiracetam. The median time of onset is reported to be 14 to 17 days, but cases have been reported at least four months after initiation of treatment. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with levetiracetam has also been reported. Levetiracetam extended-release tablets should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="xmChange">Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including levetiracetam. These events can be fatal or life-threatening, particularly if diagnosis and treatment do not occur as early as possible. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Levetiracetam extended-release tablets should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established

                        <paragraph>Coordination difficulties were not observed in the levetiracetam extended-release tablets controlled trial, however, the number of patients exposed to levetiracetam extended-release tablets was considerably smaller than the number of patients exposed to immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in controlled trials. However, adverse reactions observed in the immediate-release levetiracetam tablets controlled trials may also occur in patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  A total of 3.4% of adult levetiracetam-treated patients experienced coordination difficulties, (reported as either ataxia, abnormal gait, or incoordination) compared to 1.6% of placebo-treated patients. A total of 0.4% of patients in controlled trials discontinued levetiracetam treatment due to ataxia, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. In 0.7% of levetiracetam-treated patients and in 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, the dose was reduced due to coordination difficulties, while one of the levetiracetam-treated patients was hospitalized due to worsening of pre-existing ataxia. These events occurred most frequently within the first 4 weeks of treatment.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be monitored for these signs and symptoms and advised not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on levetiracetam to gauge whether it could adversely affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Levetiracetam extended-release tablets can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell (RBC) counts; decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have also been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In controlled trials of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in patients experiencing partial-onset seizures, minor, but statistically significant, decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC count (0.03 x 10
 
  <sup>6</sup>/mm
 
  <sup>3</sup>), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in immediate-release levetiracetam-treated patients.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤2.8 x 10
 
  <sup>9</sup>/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤1 x 10
 
  <sup>9</sup>/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pediatric patients (4 to &lt;16 years of age), statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets, as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the immediate-release levetiracetam tablets group were -0.4 × 10
 
  <sup>9</sup>/L and -0.3 × 10
 
  <sup>9</sup>/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. A significant increase in mean relative lymphocyte counts was observed in 1.7% of patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets compared to a decrease of 4% in patients on placebo.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the controlled pediatric trial, a possibly clinically significant abnormal low WBC value was observed in 3% of patients treated with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets, compared to no patients on placebo. However, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count. No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the controlled pediatric cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, two subjects (6.1%) in the placebo group and 5 subjects (8.6%) in the immediate-release levetiracetam-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥10% or ≥0.7 x 10
 
  <sup>9</sup>/L).

                           <br/>  In the controlled clinical study, 5% of patients receiving levetiracetam extended-release tablets and 3% receiving placebo discontinued as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation and that occurred more frequently in levetiracetam extended-release-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients were asthenia, epilepsy, mouth ulceration, rash, and respiratory failure. Each of these adverse reactions led to discontinuation in a levetiracetam extended-release-treated patient and no placebo-treated patients.

  </content>. Although the pattern of adverse reactions in the levetiracetam extended-release tablets study seems somewhat different from that seen in partial-onset seizure controlled studies for immediate-release levetiracetam tablets, this is possibly due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to the immediate-release tablet studies. The adverse reactions for levetiracetam extended-release tablets are expected to be similar to those seen with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets.

                           <br/>  In controlled clinical studies of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets as adjunctive therapy to other AEDs in adults with partial-onset seizures, the most common adverse reactions, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in placebo-controlled studies and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either immediate-release levetiracetam tablets or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.</paragraph>

There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal developmental in rats (1,200 mg/kg/day) is approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 3,000 mg on a body surface area (mg/m

The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits (200 mg/kg/day) is approximately equivalent to the MRHD on a mg/m

There was no evidence of maternal toxicity. The no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre-and postnatal development in rats (70 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of levetiracetam to rats during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation produced no adverse developmental or maternal effects at doses of up to 1,800 mg/kg/day (6 times the MRHD on a mg/m

                        <paragraph>A 3-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the neurocognitive and behavioral effects of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets as adjunctive therapy in 98 pediatric patients with inadequately controlled partial seizures, ages 4 to 16 years (levetiracetam tablets N=64; placebo N=34). The target dose of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets was 60 mg/kg/day. Neurocognitive effects were measured by the Leiter-R Attention and Memory (AM) Battery, which assesses various aspects of a child's memory and attention. Although no substantive differences were observed between the placebo- and levetiracetam-treated groups in the median change from baseline in this battery, the study was not adequate to assess formal statistical non-inferiority between the drug and placebo. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18), a standardized validated tool used to assess a child’s competencies and behavioral/emotional problems, was also assessed in this study. An analysis of the CBCL/6-18 indicated a worsening in aggressive behavior, one of the eight syndrome scores, in patients treated with levetiracetam tablets

                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism(s) by which levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A saturable and stereoselective neuronal binding site in rat brain tissue has been described for levetiracetam. Experimental data indicate that this binding site is the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, thought to be involved in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. Although the molecular significance of levetiracetam binding to synaptic vesicle protein SV2A is not understood, levetiracetam and related analogs showed a rank order of affinity for SV2A which correlated with the potency of their antiseizure activity in audiogenic seizure-prone mice. These findings suggest that the interaction of levetiracetam with the SV2A protein may contribute to the antiepileptic mechanism of action of the drug.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  The effects of levetiracetam extended-release tablets on QTc prolongation is expected to be the same as that of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets. The effect of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets on QTc prolongation was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo-controlled crossover study of levetiracetam tablets (1,000 mg or 5,000 mg) in 52 healthy subjects. The upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc was below 10 milliseconds. Therefore, there was no evidence of significant QTc prolongation in this study.

                     <title>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Overview</content>
                           <br/>  Bioavailability of levetiracetam extended-release tablets are similar to that of the immediate-release levetiracetam tablets. The pharmacokinetics (AUC and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>) were shown to be dose proportional after single dose administration of 1,000 mg, 2,000 mg, and 3,000 mg extended-release levetiracetam. Plasma half-life of extended-release levetiracetam is approximately 7 hours.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Levetiracetam is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are linear and time-invariant, with low intra- and inter-subject variability. Levetiracetam is not significantly protein-bound (&lt;10% bound) and its volume of distribution is close to the volume of intracellular and extracellular water. Sixty-six percent (66%) of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. The major metabolic pathway of levetiracetam (24% of dose) is an enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group. It is not liver cytochrome P450 dependent. The metabolites have no known pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life of levetiracetam across studies is approximately 6 to 8 hours. The half-life is increased in the elderly (primarily due to impaired renal clearance) and in subjects with renal impairment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam are similar when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Absorption and Distribution</content>
                           <br/>  Extended-release levetiracetam peak plasma concentrations occur in about 4 hours. The time to peak plasma concentrations is about 3 hours longer with extended-release levetiracetam than with immediate-release tablets.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Single administration of two 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets once daily produced comparable maximal plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration versus time as did the administration of one 500 mg immediate-release tablet twice daily in fasting conditions. After multiple dose extended-release levetiracetam tablets intake, extent of exposure (AUC
 
  <sub>0-24</sub>) was similar to extent of exposure after multiple dose immediate-release tablets intake. C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and C
 
  <sub>min</sub>were lower by 17% and 26% after multiple dose extended-release levetiracetam tablets intake in comparison to multiple dose immediate-release tablets intake. Intake of a high fat, high calorie breakfast before the administration of extended-release levetiracetam tablets resulted in a higher peak concentration, and longer median time to peak. The median time to peak (T
 
  <sub>max</sub>) was 2 hours longer in the fed state.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two 750 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets were bioequivalent to a single administration of three 500 mg extended-release levetiracetam tablets.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Metabolism</content>
                           <br/>  Levetiracetam is not extensively metabolized in humans. The major metabolic pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the acetamide group, which produces the carboxylic acid metabolite, ucb L057 (24% of dose) and is not dependent on any liver cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. The major metabolite is inactive in animal seizure models. Two minor metabolites were identified as the product of hydroxylation of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring (2% of dose) and opening of the 2-oxo-pyrrolidine ring in position 5 (1% of dose). There is no enantiomeric interconversion of levetiracetam or its major metabolite.

                           <content styleCode="underline">Elimination</content>
                           <br/>  Levetiracetam plasma half-life in adults is 7 ± 1 hour and is unaffected by either dose or repeated administration. Levetiracetam is eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion as unchanged drug which represents 66% of administered dose. The total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 mL/min/kg. The mechanism of excretion is glomerular filtration with subsequent partial tubular reabsorption. The metabolite ucb L057 is excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance of 4 mL/min/kg. Levetiracetam elimination is correlated to creatinine clearance. Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with impaired renal function

                           <br/>  There are insufficient pharmacokinetic data to specifically address the use of extended-release levetiracetam in the elderly population.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pharmacokinetics of immediate-release levetiracetam were evaluated in 16 elderly subjects (age 61 to 88 years) with creatinine clearance ranging from 30 to 74 mL/min. Following oral administration of twice-daily dosing for 10 days, total body clearance decreased by 38% and the half-life was 2.5 hours longer in the elderly compared to healthy adults. This is most likely due to the decrease in renal function in these subjects.</paragraph>

Levetiracetam extended-release oral tablets (1,000 mg to 3,000 mg) were administered once daily with a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 7 days of treatment to 12 pediatric patients and 13 adults in the study. Dose-normalized steady-state exposure parameters, C

                           <br/>  Extended-release levetiracetam C

                           <br/>  Formal pharmacokinetic studies of the effects of race have not been conducted with extended-release or immediate-release levetiracetam. Cross study comparisons involving Caucasians (N=12) and Asians (N=12), however, show that pharmacokinetics of immediate-release levetiracetam were comparable between the two races. Because levetiracetam is primarily renally excreted and there are no important racial differences in creatinine clearance, pharmacokinetic differences due to race are not expected.

                           <content styleCode="italics">Renal Impairment</content>
                           <br/>  The effect of levetiracetam extended-release tablets on renally impaired patients was not assessed in the controlled study. However, it is expected that the effect on levetiracetam extended-release-treated patients would be similar to that seen in controlled studies of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets. In patients with end stage renal disease on dialysis, it is recommended that immediate-release levetiracetam be used instead of levetiracetam extended-release tablets.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The disposition of immediate-release levetiracetam was studied in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal function. Total body clearance of levetiracetam is reduced in patients with impaired renal function by 40% in the mild group (CLcr = 50 to 80 mL/min), 50% in the moderate group (CLcr = 30 to 50 mL/min) and 60% in the severe renal impairment group (CLcr &lt;30 mL/min). Clearance of levetiracetam is correlated with creatinine clearance.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In anuric (end stage renal disease) patients, the total body clearance decreased 70% compared to normal subjects (CLcr &gt;80 mL/min). Approximately 50% of the pool of levetiracetam in the body is removed during a standard 4-hour hemodialysis procedure

                           <br/>  In subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) to moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam were unchanged. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), total body clearance was 50% that of normal subjects, but decreased renal clearance accounted for most of the decrease. No dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment.

                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>data on metabolic interactions indicate that levetiracetam is unlikely to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions. Levetiracetam and its major metabolite, at concentrations well above C

                        <paragraph>Potential pharmacokinetic interactions of or with levetiracetam were assessed in clinical pharmacokinetic studies (phenytoin, valproate, warfarin, digoxin, oral contraceptive, probenecid) and through pharmacokinetic screening with immediate-release levetiracetam tablets in the placebo-controlled clinical studies in epilepsy patients.

Valproate 500 mg twice daily did not modify the rate or extent of levetiracetam absorption or its plasma clearance or urinary excretion. There also was no effect on exposure to and the excretion of the primary metabolite, ucb L057.

These data indicate that levetiracetam does not influence the plasma concentration of other AEDs and that these AEDs do not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

                           <br/>  Immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (500 mg twice daily) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel, or of the luteinizing hormone and progesterone levels, indicating that impairment of contraceptive efficacy is unlikely. Coadministration of this oral contraceptive did not influence the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam.

                           <br/>  Probenecid, a renal tubular secretion blocking agent, administered at a dose of 500 mg four times a day, did not change the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam 1,000 mg twice daily. C

                           <sub>max</sub>of the metabolite, ucb L057, was approximately doubled in the presence of probenecid while the fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine remained the same. Renal clearance of ucb L057 in the presence of probenecid decreased 60%, probably related to competitive inhibition of tubular secretion of ucb L057. The effect of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets on probenecid was not studied.

                           <br/>  Rats were dosed with levetiracetam in the diet for 104 weeks at doses of 50, 300, and 1,800 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the highest dose was approximately 6 times that in humans at the maximum recommended daily human dose (MRHD) of 3,000 mg. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity. In mice, oral administration of levetiracetam for 80 weeks (doses up to 960 mg/kg/day) or 2 years (doses up to 4,000 mg/kg/day, lowered to 3,000 mg/kg/day after 45 weeks due to intolerability) was not associated with an increase in tumors. The highest dose tested in mice for 2 years (3,000 mg/kg/day) is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a body surface area (mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>) basis.

                  <paragraph>The effectiveness of levetiracetam extended-release for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. This was supported by the demonstration of efficacy of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets (see below) in partial seizures in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in adults, as well as a demonstration of comparable bioavailability between the extended-release and immediate-release formulations

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of levetiracetam extended-release tablets for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study across 7 countries in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization (Study 1).</paragraph>

                           <br/>  Patients enrolled in Study 1 had at least eight partial seizures with or without secondary generalization during the 8-week baseline period and at least two partial seizures in each 4-week interval of the baseline period. Patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one AED and could take a maximum of three AEDs. After a prospective baseline period of 8 weeks, 158 patients were randomized to placebo (N=79) or 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets) of levetiracetam extended-release tablets (N=79), given once daily over a 12-week treatment period.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 1 was the percent reduction over placebo in mean weekly frequency of partial-onset seizures. The median percent reduction in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency from baseline over the treatment period was 46.1% in the levetiracetam extended-release tablets 1,000 mg treatment group (N=74) and 33.4% in the placebo group (N=78). The estimated percent reduction over placebo in weekly partial-onset seizure frequency over the treatment period was 14.4% (statistically significant).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The relationship between the effectiveness of the same daily dose of levetiracetam extended-release tablets and immediate-release levetiracetam has not been studied and is unknown.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in adults was established in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients who had refractory partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization (Studies 2, 3, and 4). The tablet formulation was used in all three studies. In these studies, 904 patients were randomized to placebo, levetiracetam tablets 1,000 mg, levetiracetam tablets 2,000 mg, or levetiracetam tablets 3,000 mg/day. Patients enrolled in Study 2 or Study 3 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least two years and had taken two or more AEDs. Patients enrolled in Study 4 had refractory partial-onset seizures for at least 1 year and had taken one AED. At the time of the study, patients were taking a stable dose regimen of at least one AED and could take a maximum of two AEDs. During the baseline period, patients had to have experienced at least two partial-onset seizures during each 4-week period.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 41 sites in the United States, comparing immediate-release levetiracetam tablets 1,000 mg/day (N=97), immediate-release levetiracetam tablets 3,000 mg/day (N=101), and placebo (N=95), given in equally divided doses twice daily. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients in Study 2 were randomized to one of the three treatment groups described above. The 18-week treatment period consisted of a 6-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED regimens were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness in Study 2 was a between-group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency). The results of Study 2 are displayed in Table 6.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Study 4 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 47 centers in Europe comparing immediate-release levetiracetam tablets 3,000 mg/day (N=180) and placebo (N=104) in patients with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, receiving only one concomitant AED. Study drug was given in two divided doses. After a prospective baseline period of 12 weeks, patients in Study 4 were randomized to one of two treatment groups described above. The 16-week treatment period consisted of a 4-week titration period, followed by a 12-week fixed dose evaluation period, during which concomitant AED doses were held constant. The primary measure of effectiveness in Study 4 was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency). Table 8 displays the results of Study 4.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The use of levetiracetam extended-release tablets in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older is supported by Study 5, which was conducted using immediate-release levetiracetam tablets. Levetiracetam extended-release tablets are not indicated in children below 12 years of age.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of immediate-release levetiracetam tablets for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted at 60 sites in North America, in children 4 to 16 years of age with partial seizures uncontrolled by standard antiepileptic drugs (Study 5). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, who still experienced at least 4 partial-onset seizures during the 4 weeks prior to screening, as well as at least 4 partial-onset seizures in each of the two 4-week baseline periods, were randomized to receive either immediate-release levetiracetam tablets or placebo. The enrolled population included 198 patients (levetiracetam tablets N=101; placebo N=97) with refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalization. Study 5 consisted of an 8-week baseline period and 4-week titration period followed by a 10-week evaluation period. Dosing was initiated at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. During the treatment period, the immediate-release levetiracetam tablets doses were adjusted in 20 mg/kg/day increments, at 2-week intervals to the target dose of 60 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness in Study 5 was a between group comparison of the percent reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency relative to placebo over the entire 14-week randomized treatment period (titration + evaluation period). Secondary outcome variables included the responder rate (incidence of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in partial-onset seizure frequency per week). Table 9 displays the results of this study.</paragraph>
