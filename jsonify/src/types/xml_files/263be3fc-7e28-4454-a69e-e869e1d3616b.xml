                  <paragraph>Clindamycin Injection, USP, a clear colorless to pale yellow sterile solution, contains clindamycin phosphate, a water soluble ester of clindamycin and phosphoric acid. Each mL contains the equivalent of 150 mg clindamycin, 0.5 mg disodium edetate and 9.45 mg benzyl alcohol added as preservative in each mL. Sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid may be added to adjust pH. Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The chemical name of clindamycin phosphate is L-threo-α-D-galacto-Octopyranoside, methyl-7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-[[(1-methyl-4-propyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)carbonyl]amino]-1-thio-,2-(dihydrogen phosphate), (2S-trans)-.</paragraph>

                     <br/>Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is converted to active clindamycin. By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Metabolism</content>
                     <br/>In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin.</paragraph>

                     <br/>Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2½ hours in pediatric patients.</paragraph>

                     <br/>The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="italics">Geriatric Patients</content>
                     <br/>Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4 hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function1.</paragraph>

                     <br/>Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in body weight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA). The dosing regimens for pediatric patients ≤32 weeks PMA (5 mg/kg) and &gt;32 to ≤40 weeks PMA (7 mg/kg), both administered intravenously every 8 hours, achieve exposures comparable to therapeutic exposures in adults (weighing 70 kg) administered clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours (Table 1).</paragraph>

                     <br/>Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="underline">Resistance</content>
                     <br/>Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin Injection, USP is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the <content styleCode="bold">BOXED WARNING</content>, before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below:</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (except E. faecalis), and Staphylococcus aureus.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis), and susceptible anaerobes.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Clindamycin Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Clindamycin Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</paragraph>

                     <br/>Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.</paragraph>

                     <br/>This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. The administration of intravenous solutions containing the preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with the “gasping syndrome”, and death in neonates. Symptoms include a striking onset of gasping respiration, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Although the normal therapeutic dose of this product delivers amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the “gasping syndrome”, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known and total daily benzyl alcohol exposure may be increased by concomitant medications.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity depends on the quantity administered and the liver and kidneys' capacity to detoxify the chemical. Premature and low birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">General</content>
                     <br/>Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin injection products should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin injection should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The use of clindamycin injection may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms-particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin injection should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10 to 60 minutes as directed in the <content styleCode="bold">DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</content> section.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin dosage modification is not necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prescribing clindamycin injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Information for Patients</content>
                     <br/>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clindamycin injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clindamycin injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clindamycin injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Laboratory Tests</content>
                     <br/>During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Drug Interactions</content>
                     <br/>Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In vitro studies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</content>
                     <br/>Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Pregnancy:</content> Teratogenic effects</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Clindamycin injection contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta. See <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>.</paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="bold">Nursing Mothers</content>
                     <br/>Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breastfed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breastfed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Pediatric Use</content>
                     <br/>When clindamycin injection is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable (see <content styleCode="bold">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</content>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Usage in Newborns and Infants</content>
                     <br/>This product contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal "Gasping Syndrome" in premature infants. See <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated. See <content styleCode="bold">WARNINGS</content>.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Geriatric Use</content>
                     <br/>Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficile) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (&gt;60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.</paragraph>
