                     <title>5.8 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.<br/>
                           <br/> The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.<br/>
                           <br/> Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.<br/>
                           <br/> Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving pantoprazole sodium for injection, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.10 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.<br/>
                           <br/> For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_6.2">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</linkHtml>].</content>
                           <br/>
                           <br/> Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of pantoprazole sodium for injection and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop pantoprazole sodium for injection treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_12.2">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>].</content>

                        <paragraph>Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.

                           <br/> Available data from published observational studies did not demonstrate an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with pantoprazole.<br/>
                           <br/> In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse development outcomes was observed with pantoprazole sodium. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at intravenous doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (4 times the recommended human dose) and rabbits at intravenous doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (6 times the recommended human dose) with administration of pantoprazole during organogenesis in pregnant animals and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to pantoprazole in this study <content styleCode="italics">(see Data).</content>
                           <br/>
                           <br/> A pre-and post-natal development toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate the effect on bone development was performed with pantoprazole sodium. Oral pantoprazole doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day) were administered to pregnant females from gestation day (GD) 6 through lactation day (LD) 21. Changes in bone morphology were observed in pups exposed to pantoprazole <content styleCode="italics">in utero</content> and through milk during the period of lactation as well as by oral dosing from postnatal day (PND) 4 through PND 21 <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_8.4">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</linkHtml>]</content>. There were no drug-related findings in maternal animals. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal harm.<br/>
                           <br/> The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.<br/>

                           <br/> Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a Relative Risk (RR)=0.55, [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.08-3.95]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR=1.12 ([95% CI 0.86-1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR=1.29 [95% CI 0.84-1.97]).<br/>

Oral pantoprazole doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day on a body surface area basis) were administered to pregnant females from gestation day (GD) 6 through lactation day (LD) 21. On postnatal day (PND 4) through PND 21, the pups were administered oral doses at 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 2.3, and 3.2 times the exposure (AUC) in humans at a dose of 40 mg). There were no drug-related findings in maternal animals. During the preweaning dosing phase (PND 4 to 21) of the pups, there were increased mortality and/or moribundity and decreased body weight and body weight gain at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans receiving the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. On PND 21, decreased mean femur length and weight and changes in femur bone mass and geometry were observed in the offspring at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses. The femur findings included lower total area, bone mineral content and density, periosteal and endosteal circumference, and cross-sectional moment of inertia. There were no microscopic changes in the distal femur, proximal tibia, or stifle joints. Changes in bone parameters were partially reversible following a recovery period, with findings on PND 70 limited to lower femur metaphysis cortical/subcortical bone mineral density in female pups at 5 mg/kg/day (approximately equal exposures (AUC) in humans at the 40 mg dose) and higher doses.</paragraph>

                           <br/> The breast milk of a 42-year-old woman receiving 40 mg of oral pantoprazole, at 10 months postpartum, was studied for 24 hours, to demonstrate low levels of pantoprazole present in the breast milk. Pantoprazole was detectable in milk only 2 and 4 hours after the dose with milk levels of approximately 36 mcg/L and 24 mcg/L, respectively. A milk-to-plasma ratio of 0.022 was observed at 2 hours after drug administration. Pantoprazole was not detectable (&lt;10 mcg/L) in milk at 6, 8 and 24 hours after the dose. The relative dose to the infant was estimated to be 7.3 mcg of pantoprazole, which is equivalent to 0.14% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. No adverse events in the infant were reported by the mother.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The active ingredient in pantoprazole sodium for injection (pantoprazole sodium), a PPI, is a substituted benzimidazole, sodium 5-(difluoromethoxy)-2-[[(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridinyl)methyl] sulfinyl]-1<content styleCode="italics">H</content>-benzimidazole, a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion. Its empirical formula is C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>14</sub>F<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>NaO<sub>4</sub>S, with a molecular weight of 405.4. The structural formula is:</paragraph>

                     <br/>
                     <br/> Pantoprazole sodium USP is a white to off-white powder and is racemic. Pantoprazole has weakly basic and acidic properties. Pantoprazole sodium is freely soluble in water, in methanol, and in dehydrated alcohol, practically insoluble in hexane and in dichloromethane. The reconstituted solution of pantoprazole sodium for injection is in the pH range 9.0 to 10.5.<br/>
                     <br/> Pantoprazole sodium for injection is supplied for intravenous administration as a sterile, lyophilised cake or powder in a single-dose clear glass vial fitted with a rubber stopper and crimp seal. Each vial contains 40 mg pantoprazole (equivalent to 45.1 mg of pantoprazole sodium USP), edetate disodium (1 mg), and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Pantoprazole is a PPI that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg).</paragraph>

                           <br/> The magnitude and time course for inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid output (PSAO) by single doses (20 to 120 mg) of pantoprazole sodium for injection were assessed in a single-dose, open-label, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. The results of this study are shown in Table 4. Healthy subjects received a continuous infusion for 25 hours of pentagastrin (PG) at 1 mcg/kg/h, a dose known to produce submaximal gastric acid secretion. The placebo group showed a sustained, continuous acid output for 25 hours, validating the reliability of the testing model. Pantoprazole sodium for injection had an onset of antisecretory activity within 15 to 30 minutes of administration. Doses of 20 to 80 mg of pantoprazole sodium for injection substantially reduced the 24-hour cumulative PSAO in a dose-dependent manner, despite a short plasma elimination half-life. Complete suppression of PSAO was achieved with 80 mg within approximately 2 hours and no further significant suppression was seen with 120 mg. The duration of action of pantoprazole sodium for injection was 24 hours.<br/>

Gastric NE-cell tumors in rats may result from chronic elevation of serum gastrin concentrations. The high density of ECL cells in the rat stomach makes this species highly susceptible to the proliferative effects of elevated gastrin concentrations produced by PPIs. However, there were no observed elevations in serum gastrin following the administration of oral pantoprazole at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day. In a separate study, a gastric NE-cell tumor without concomitant ECL-cell proliferative changes was observed in 1 female rat following 12 months of dosing with oral pantoprazole at 5 mg/kg/day and a 9 month off-dose recovery <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#Section_13.1">Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)</linkHtml>].</content>

                           <br/> Pantoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is demethylation, by CYP2C19, with subsequent sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4. There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites have significant pharmacologic activity. CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3% of Whites and African-Americans and 17 to 23% of Asians). Although these sub-populations of slow pantoprazole metabolizers have elimination half-life values from 3.5 to 10 hours, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once daily dosing.<br/>

                           <br/> After administration of a single intravenous dose of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled pantoprazole sodium to healthy, extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers, approximately 71% of the dose was excreted in the urine with 18% excreted in the feces through biliary excretion. There was no renal excretion of unchanged pantoprazole.<br/>

                           <br/> In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A to C), maximum pantoprazole concentrations increased only slightly (1.5-fold) relative to healthy subjects when pantoprazole sodium was administered orally. Although serum half-life values increased to 7 to 9 hours and AUC values increased by 5- to 7-fold in hepatic-impaired patients, these increases were no greater than those observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, where no dosage adjustment is warranted. These pharmacokinetic changes in hepatic-impaired patients result in minimal drug accumulation following once daily, multiple-dose administration. Oral pantoprazole doses higher than 40 mg per day have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients.<br/>

                           <br/> Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. In a crossover clinical study, 66 healthy subjects were administered clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day) alone and with oral pantoprazole (80 mg at the same time as clopidogrel) for 5 days. On Day 5, the mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 14% (geometric mean ratio was 86%, with 90% CI of 79 to 93%) when pantoprazole sodium was coadministered with clopidogrel as compared to clopidogrel administered alone. Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation (induced by 5 micromolar ADP) was correlated with the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite. The clinical significance of this finding is not clear.<br/>

                        <paragraph>CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some subpopulations (e.g., approximately 3% of White and African-Americans and 17% to 23% of Asians are poor metabolizers). Although these subpopulations of pantoprazole poor metabolizers have elimination half-life values of 3.5 to 10.0 hours in adults, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once-daily dosing. For adult patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, no dosage adjustment is needed.<br/>
                           <br/> Similar to adults, pediatric patients who have the poor metabolizer genotype of CYP2C19 (CYP2C19 *2/*2) exhibited greater than a 6-fold increase in AUC compared to pediatric extensive (CYP2C19 *1/*1) and intermediate (CYP2C19 *1/*x) metabolizers. Poor metabolizers exhibited approximately 10-fold lower apparent oral clearance compared to extensive metabolizers.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a 24-month carcinogenicity study, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally with pantoprazole doses of 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day, about 0.1 to 40 times the exposure on a body surface area basis of a 50-kg person dosed at 40 mg/day. In the gastric fundus, treatment with 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day produced enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia and benign and malignant neuroendocrine cell tumors in a dose-related manner. In the forestomach, treatment with 50 and 200 mg/kg/day (about 10 and 40 times the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis) produced benign squamous cell papillomas and malignant squamous cell carcinomas. Rare gastrointestinal tumors associated with pantoprazole treatment included an adenocarcinoma of the duodenum with 50 mg/kg/day and benign polyps and adenocarcinomas of the gastric fundus with 200 mg/kg/day. In the liver, treatment with 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day produced dose-related increases in the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. In the thyroid gland, treatment with 200 mg/kg/day produced increased incidences of follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas for both male and female rats.<br/>
                           <br/> In a 24-month carcinogenicity study, Fischer 344 rats were treated orally with pantoprazole doses of 5 to 50 mg/kg/day, approximately 1 to 10 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area. In the gastric fundus, treatment with 5 to 50 mg/kg/day produced enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia and benign and malignant neuroendocrine cell tumors. Dose selection for this study may not have been adequate to comprehensively evaluate the carcinogenic potential of pantoprazole.<br/>
                           <br/> In a 24-month carcinogenicity study, B6C3F1 mice were treated orally with pantoprazole doses of 5 to 150 mg/kg/day, 0.5 to 15 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area. In the liver, treatment with 150 mg/kg/day produced increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice. Treatment with 5 to 150 mg/kg/day also produced gastric fundic ECL cell hyperplasia.<br/>
                           <br/> A 26-week p53 +/-transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study was not positive.<br/>
                           <br/> Pantoprazole was positive in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assays, in one of two mouse micronucleus tests for clastogenic effects, and in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> Chinese hamster ovarian cell/HGPRT forward mutation assay for mutagenic effects.

                           <br/> There were no effects on fertility or reproductive performance when pantoprazole was given at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day in male rats (98 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) and 450 mg/kg/day in female rats (88 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A multicenter, double-blind, two-period placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the ability of pantoprazole sodium for injection to maintain gastric acid suppression in patients switched from pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets to pantoprazole sodium for injection. GERD patients (n=65, 26 to 64 years; 35 female; 9 Black, 11 Hispanic, 44 White, 1 other) with a history of EE were randomized to receive either 20 or 40 mg of oral pantoprazole once per day for 10 days (period 1), and then were switched in period 2 to either daily pantoprazole sodium for injection or placebo for 7 days, matching their respective dose level from period 1. Patients were administered all test medication with a light meal. Maximum acid output (MAO) and basal acid output (BAO) were determined 24 hours following the last day of oral medication (day 10), the first day (day 1) of intravenous administration and the last day of intravenous administration (day 7). MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin.<br/>
                           <br/> This study demonstrated that, after 10 days of repeated oral administration followed by 7 days of intravenous administration, the oral and intravenous dosage forms of pantoprazole sodium 40 mg are similar in their ability to suppress MAO and BAO in patients with GERD and a history of EE (see Table 5). Also, patients on oral pantoprazole sodium who were switched to intravenous placebo experienced a significant increase in acid output within 48 hours of their last oral dose (see Table 5). However, at 48 hours after their last oral dose, patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection had a significantly lower mean basal acid output (see Table 5) than those treated with placebo.<br/>

                           <br/> To evaluate the effectiveness of pantoprazole sodium for injection as an initial treatment to suppress gastric acid secretion, two studies were conducted.<br/>
                           <br/> Study 1 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of the pharmacodynamic effects of pantoprazole sodium for injection and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Patients with GERD and a history of EE (n=78, 20 to 67 years; 39 females; 7 Black, 19 Hispanic, 52 White) were randomized to receive either 40 mg pantoprazole sodium for injection, 40 mg pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, or placebo once daily for 7 days. Following an overnight fast, test medication was administered and patients were given a light meal within 15 minutes. MAO and BAO were determined 24 hours following the last day of study medication. MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin to stimulate acid secretion. This study demonstrated that, after treatment for 7 days, patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection had a significantly lower MAO and BAO than those treated with placebo (p&lt;0.001), and results were comparable to those of patients treated with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets (see Table 6).<content styleCode="bold">

                        <paragraph>* p&lt;0.001 Significantly different from Pantoprazole sodium for injection<br/>
                           <br/> Study 2 was a single-center, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the clinical effects of pantoprazole sodium for injection and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Patients (n=45, median age 56 years, 21 males and 24 females) with acute endoscopically proven reflux esophagitis (Savary/Miller Stage II or III) with at least 1 of 3 symptoms typical for reflux esophagitis (acid eructation, heartburn, or pain on swallowing) were randomized to receive either 40 mg pantoprazole sodium for injection or 40 mg pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily for 5 days. After the initial 5 days, all patients were treated with 40 mg oral pantoprazole daily to complete a total of 8 weeks of treatment. Symptom relief was assessed by calculating the daily mean of the sums of the average scores for these 3 symptoms and the daily mean of the average score for each of the symptoms separately. There was no significant difference in symptom relief between pantoprazole sodium for injection and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets within the first 5 days. A repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks of treatment revealed that 20 out of 23 (87%) patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection plus pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and 19 out of 22 (86%) of the patients treated with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets had endoscopically proven healing of their esophageal lesions.<br/>
                           <br/> Data comparing pantoprazole sodium for injection to other PPIs (oral or intravenous) or H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists (oral or intravenous) are limited, and therefore, are inadequate to support any conclusions regarding comparative efficacy.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Two studies measured the pharmacodynamic effects of 6 day treatment with pantoprazole sodium for injection in patients with ZE Syndrome (with and without multiple endocrine neoplasia type I). In one of these studies, an initial treatment with pantoprazole sodium for injection in 21 patients (29 to 75 years; 8 female; 4 Black, 1 Hispanic, 16 White) reduced acid output to the target level (10 mEq/h or less) and significantly reduced H<sup>+</sup> concentration and the volume of gastric secretions; target levels were achieved within 45 minutes of drug administration. <br/>
                           <br/> In the other study of 14 patients (38 to 67 years; 5 female; 2 Black, 12 White) with ZE Syndrome, treatment was switched from an oral PPI to pantoprazole sodium for injection. Pantoprazole sodium for injection maintained or improved control of gastric acid secretion.<br/>
                           <br/> In both studies, total doses of 160 or 240 mg per day of pantoprazole sodium for injection, administered in divided doses, maintained basal acid secretion below target levels in all patients. Target levels were 10 mEq/h in patients without prior gastric surgery, and 5 mEq/h in all patients with prior gastric acid-reducing surgery. Once gastric acid secretion was controlled, there was no evidence of tolerance during this 7 day study. Basal acid secretion was maintained below target levels for at least 24 hours in all patients and through the end of treatment in these studies (3 to 7 days) in all but 1 patient who required a dose adjustment guided by acid output measurements until acid control was achieved. In both studies, doses were adjusted to the individual patient need, but gastric acid secretion was controlled in greater than 80% of patients by a starting regimen of 80 mg every 12 hours.</paragraph>
