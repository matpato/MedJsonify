                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The recommended initial dose of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsule is 1 capsule of amlodipine 2.5 mg/benazepril 10 mg orally once-daily. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Begin therapy with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules only after a patient has either (a) failed to achieve the desired antihypertensive effect with amlodipine or benazepril monotherapy, or (b) demonstrated inability to achieve adequate antihypertensive effect with amlodipine therapy without developing edema. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The antihypertensive effect of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsule is largely attained within 2 weeks. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, the dose may be titrated up to amlodipine 10 mg/benazepril 40 mg once-daily. The dosing should be individualized and adjusted according to the patient's clinical response. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials of amlodipine/benazepril combination therapy using amlodipine doses of 2.5 to 10 mg and benazepril doses of 10 to 40 mg, the antihypertensive effects increased with increasing dose of amlodipine in all patient groups, and the effects increased with increasing dose of benazepril in nonblack groups.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsule as soon as possible <content styleCode="italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#ID316">8.1</linkHtml>)].</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride can cause symptomatic hypotension, sometimes complicated by oliguria, progressive azotemia, acute renal failure, or death. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have heart failure, severe aortic or mitral stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or have been volume or salt depleted as a result of diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Correct volume and salt depletion before starting therapy with benazepril. If hypotension occurs, place the patient in the supine position and give physiological saline intravenously if needed. Continue treatment with benazepril once blood pressure and volume have returned to normal. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients with congestive heart failure, start amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules therapy under close medical supervision; follow closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of the benazepril component is increased or a diuretic is added or its dose increased. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, benazepril will block the angiotensin II formation that could otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that affect the RAS. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the RAS (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) or who are on NSAIDS or ARBs may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride. Drugs that affect the RAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. In U.S. placebo-controlled trials of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride, hyperkalemia [serum potassium at least 0.5 mEq/L greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN)] not present at baseline occurred in approximately 1.5% of hypertensive patients receiving amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride. Increases in serum potassium were generally reversible.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

                        <paragraph>Amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride has been evaluated for safety in over 2,991 patients with hypertension; over 500 of these patients were treated for at least 6 months, and over 400 were treated for more than 1 year.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a pooled analysis of 5 placebo-controlled trials involving amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules doses up to 5 mg/20 mg, the reported side effects were generally mild and transient, and there was no relationship between side effects and age, sex, race, or duration of therapy. Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects was required in approximately 4% of patients treated with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules and in 3% of patients treated with placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules in these studies were cough and edema (including angioedema).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The peripheral edema associated with amlodipine use is dose-dependent. When benazepril is added to a regimen of amlodipine, the incidence of edema is substantially reduced.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The addition of benazepril to a regimen of amlodipine should not be expected to provide additional antihypertensive effect in African-Americans. However, all patient groups benefit from the reduction in amlodipine-induced edema.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The side effects considered possibly or probably related to study drug that occurred in these trials in more than 1% of patients treated with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride are shown in the table below. Cough was the only adverse event with at least possible relationship to treatment that was more common on amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules (3.3%) than on placebo (0.2%).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe neonates with histories of <content styleCode="italics">in utero </content>exposure to amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. In neonates with a history of <content styleCode="italics">in utero </content>exposure to amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function. </paragraph>

On a body surface area basis, the 2.5 mg/kg/day dose of amlodipine is twice the amlodipine dose delivered when the maximum recommended dose of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules is given to a 60 kg patient. Similarly, the 5 mg/kg/day dose of benazepril is approximately equivalent with the benazepril dose delivered when the maximum recommended dose of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules is given to a 60 kg patient. No teratogenic effects were seen when benazepril and amlodipine were administered in combination to pregnant rats or rabbits. Rats received doses of up to 50:25 mg (benazepril:amlodipine)/kg/day (12 times the MRHD on a body surface area basis, assuming a 60 kg patient). Rabbits received doses of up to 1.5:0.75 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the maximum recommended dose of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules given to a 60 kg patient).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Minimal amounts of unchanged benazepril and of benazeprilat are excreted into the breast milk of lactating women treated with benazepril, so that a newborn child ingesting nothing but breast milk would receive less than 0.1% of the maternal doses of benazepril and benazeprilat. Limited available data from a published clinical lactation study reports that amlodipine is present in human milk at an estimated median relative infant dose of 4.2%. No adverse effects of amlodipine on the breastfed infant have been observed. There is no available information on the effects of amlodipine or benazepril on milk production.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Only a few cases of human overdose with amlodipine have been reported. One patient was asymptomatic after a 250 mg ingestion; another, who combined 70 mg of amlodipine with an unknown large quantity of a benzodiazepine, developed refractory shock and died.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Human overdoses with any combination of amlodipine and benazepril have not been reported. In scattered reports of human overdoses with benazepril and other ACE inhibitors, there are no reports of death.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be admitted to hospital and, generally, should be managed in an intensive care setting, with continuous monitoring of cardiac function, blood gases, and blood biochemistry. Emergency supportive measures such as artificial ventilation or cardiac pacing should be instituted if appropriate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the event of a potentially life-threatening oral overdose, use induction of vomiting or gastric lavage and/or activated charcoal to remove the drug from the gastrointestinal tract (only if presented within 1 hour after ingestion of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Other clinical manifestations of overdose should be managed symptomatically based on modern methods of intensive care.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdose, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison-Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison-control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdose, consider the possibilities of multiple-drug overdoses, drug-drug interactions, and unusual drug kinetics in your patient.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most likely effect of overdose with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsule is vasodilation, with consequent hypotension and tachycardia. Simple repletion of central fluid volume (Trendelenburg positioning, infusion of crystalloids) may be sufficient therapy, but pressor agents (norepinephrine or high-dose dopamine) may be required. With abrupt return of peripheral vascular tone, overdoses of other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have sometimes progressed to pulmonary edema, and patients must be monitored for this complication.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Analyses of bodily fluids for concentrations of amlodipine, benazepril, or their metabolites are not widely available. Such analyses are, in any event, not known to be of value in therapy or prognosis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No data are available to suggest physiologic maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of amlodipine, benazepril, or their metabolites. Benazeprilat is only slightly dialyzable; attempted clearance of amlodipine by hemodialysis or hemo-perfusion has not been reported, but amlodipine's high protein binding makes it unlikely that these interventions will be of value.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist-antidote to benazepril, but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research laboratories.</paragraph>

                           </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Benazepril and benazeprilat inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and in animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Hypertensive patients treated with benazepril and amlodipine for up to 56 weeks had elevations of serum potassium up to 0.2 mEq/L <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID293">5.8</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In animal studies, benazepril had no inhibitory effect on the vasopressor response to angiotensin II and did not interfere with the hemodynamic effects of the autonomic neurotransmitters acetylcholine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride remains to be elucidated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While the mechanism through which benazepril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, benazepril has an antihypertensive effect even in patients with low-renin hypertension.</paragraph>

                           </content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>With chronic once-daily administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressure (+1/-2 mmHg).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and humans, even when coadministered with beta blockers to humans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in intact animals or humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Amlodipine has demonstrated beneficial clinical effects in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease.</paragraph>

Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64% and 90%. Following oral administration of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules, the peak plasma concentrations of benazepril are reached in 0.5 to 2 hours. The cleavage of the ester group (primarily in the liver) converts benazepril to its active metabolite, benazeprilat, which reaches peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 to 4 hours. The extent of absorption of benazepril is at least 37%. Amlodipine and benazepril exhibit dose proportional pharmacokinetics between the therapeutic dose range of 2.5 and 10 mg and 10 and 20 mg, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90%) metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites. Benazepril is extensively metabolized to form benazeprilat as the main metabolite, which occurs by enzymatic hydrolysis, mainly in the liver. Two minor metabolites are the acyl glucuronide conjugates of benazepril and benazeprilat.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after once-daily dosing for 7 to 8 days. Ten percent of unchanged drug and 60% of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in urine. Effective elimination half-life of amlodipine is 2 days. Benazepril is eliminated mainly by metabolic clearance. Benazeprilat is eliminated via the kidneys and the bile; renal excretion is the main route in patients with normal renal function. In the urine, benazepril accounts for less than 1 % and benazeprilat for about 20 % of an oral dose. Elimination of benazeprilat is biphasic with an initial half-life of about 3 hours and a terminal half-life of about 22 hours. Benazeprilat's effective elimination half-life is 10 to 11 hours, while that of amlodipine is about 2 days, so steady-state levels of the 2 components are achieved after about a week of once-daily dosing.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with this combination. However, these studies have been conducted with amlodipine and benazepril alone (see below). No adverse effects on fertility occurred when the benazepril:amlodipine combination was given orally to rats of either sex at doses up to 15:7.5 mg (benazepril:amlodipine)/kg/day, prior to mating and throughout gestation.</paragraph>

When compared on the basis of body surface area, this dose is 18 and 9 times (rats and mice, respectively) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (calculations assume a patient weight of 60 kg). No mutagenic activity was detected in the Ames test in bacteria, in an <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>test for forward mutations in cultured mammalian cells, or in a nucleus anomaly test. At doses of 50 to 500 mg/kg/day (6 to 60 times the MRHD on a body surface area basis), benazepril had no adverse effect on the reproductive performance of male and female rats.</paragraph>

For the mouse, the highest dose was, on a body surface area basis, similar to the MRHD of 10 mg amlodipine/day. For the rat, the highest dose was, on a body surface area basis, about two and a half times the MRHD. (Calculations based on a 60 kg patient.) Mutagenicity studies conducted with amlodipine maleate revealed no drug-related effects at either the gene or chromosome level. There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate (males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating) at doses of up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (about 10 times the MRHD of 10 mg/day on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Over 950 patients received amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsule once-daily in 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose persisted for 24 hours, with peak reductions achieved 2 to 8 hours after dosing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Once-daily doses of benazepril/amlodipine using benazepril doses of 10 to 20 mg and amlodipine doses of 2.5 to10 mg decreased seated pressure (systolic/diastolic) 24 hours after dosing by about 10 to 25/6 to13 mmHg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In 2 studies in patients not adequately controlled on either benazepril 40 mg alone (n = 329) or amlodipine 10 mg alone (n = 812) once-daily doses of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules 10 mg/40 mg further decreased seated blood pressure compared to the respective monotherapy alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Combination therapy was effective in blacks and nonblacks. Both components contributed to the antihypertensive efficacy in nonblacks, but virtually all of the antihypertensive effect in blacks could be attributed to the amlodipine component. Among nonblack patients in placebo-controlled trials comparing amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules to the individual components, the blood pressure lowering effects of the combination were shown to be additive and in some cases synergistic.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During chronic therapy with amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules, the maximum reduction in blood pressure with any given dose is generally achieved after 1 to 2 weeks. The antihypertensive effects of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride capsules have continued during therapy for at least 1 year. Abrupt withdrawal of amlodipine and benazepril hydrochloride has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure.</paragraph>
