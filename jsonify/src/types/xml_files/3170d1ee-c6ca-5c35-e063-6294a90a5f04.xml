                  <paragraph>Administration of intravenous solutions may lead to fluid and/or solute overload, which may cause dilution of serum electrolyte concentration, overhydration, congestive states, or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilution is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration. The risk of developing congestive states that may lead to peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration in the solution. The solution contains 154 mmol/l sodium (Na+) and 154 mmol/l chloride (Cl-); its osmolarity is approximately 308 mOsm/l, and its pH is 5.5 (4.5 - 7.0).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
Careful clinical monitoring is required at the beginning of all intravenous infusions. Applications should be carried out under regular and careful observation. Clinical and biological parameters, especially serum electrolyte levels, should be monitored. Sodium retention may be observed in premature or full-term newborn babies, since their renal functions are not yet fully developed. Therefore, repeated sodium chloride infusions should be given to newborn babies only after serum sodium levels have been determined. Solutions containing sodium should be used with caution in cases of hypertension, heart failure, peripheral or pulmonary edema or impaired renal function, in cases of preeclampsia, in cases of aldosteronism, or in other conditions and treatments that cause sodium retention (e.g., corticosteroid therapy).
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
Pseudohyponatremia is a condition in which plasma sodium is falsely low when measured by conventional methods, even though it is not actually low. It can occur when large molecules are in abnormally high concentrations and the plasma water ratio is abnormally low as a result. This condition, which can be seen in hyperlipemia and hyperproteinemia, has also been reported to be seen in patients with diabetes mellitus. Real values ​​can be obtained by evaluating the concentration according to the plasma water ratio. Excessive application of potassium-free solutions can lead to a significant hypokalemia. Serum potassium levels should be maintained at normal levels and potassium should be added to the treatment if necessary. In order to minimize the risk of incompatibility with any other drug added to the solution, the final mixture to be infused should be checked for any turbidity or precipitation immediately after mixing, before administration and at certain intervals during administration.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
If the application is to be made with a controlled infusion pump, care should be taken to ensure that the pump is stopped before the bag is completely emptied, otherwise air embolism may occur. The solution is administered intravenously through sterile sets. It is recommended that sets used for intravenous administration be changed every 24 hours. It should only be used if the solution is clear and the bag is intact and not leaking.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
Laboratory tests: In long-term parenteral administration or when the patient's condition requires, clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory tests should be performed to monitor changes in the patient's fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance. When significant deviations from normal values ​​are observed, these values ​​should be normalized with alternative solutions. Warnings and precautions regarding pediatric use: Fluid and electrolyte balance in neonates or very young infants can be affected by even the administration of very small amounts of fluid. Care should be exercised in the treatment of neonates, especially preterm neonates, whose renal functions are not yet fully developed and whose ability to excrete solutes with fluids is limited. Fluid intake, urine output, and serum electrolyte levels should be closely monitored.

Warnings and precautions regarding use in the elderly: In general, the dose should be selected carefully in elderly patients. Considering that the liver, kidney or cardiac functions may be reduced in the elderly, other drugs may be used together or there may be diseases other than the condition being treated, it is generally recommended to start treatment with doses at the bottom of the dosage range.

Diuretics can be used to treat edema resulting from isotonic expansion, and an appropriate replacement therapy that will not cause fluid-electrolyte imbalance should be applied. Treatment of hypervolemic hypernatremia requires the removal of sodium from the body rather than water, and can be done by replacing diuretic-induced sodium and water loss with water alone. The main goal of treatment is to normalize the volume and composition of body fluids. If overdose is due to drugs added to the solution, the signs and symptoms of overdose depend on the properties of the added drug. If the dose is accidentally exceeded during treatment, the administration should be stopped, and the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms related to the drug administered. Symptomatic and supportive treatments should be applied when necessary.

Pharmacotherapeutic group: Intravenous solutions / Solutions affecting electrolyte balance ATC code: B05XA03 TURKFLEKS %0.9 ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE is an isotonic solution with an approximate osmolarity of 308 mOsm/l. When used for the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, the pharmacodynamic properties of the solution consist of the properties of sodium and chloride in its composition. Ions such as sodium pass through the cell membrane using various transport mechanisms such as the sodium pump (Na-K-ATPase). Sodium plays an important role in nerve conduction, cardiac electrophysiology and renal metabolism. Chloride is primarily an extracellular anion. Intracellular chloride is found in high concentration in red blood cells and gastric mucosa. Chloride reabsorption follows sodium reabsorption. The pharmacodynamic properties of drugs added to the solution are the same as the pharmacodynamic properties of the added drug.

The pharmacokinetic properties of TURKFLEKS %0.9 ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE consist of the properties of its components (sodium and chloride). Absorption: Active substances in drugs administered intravenously reach their maximum plasma concentrations immediately after administration. Distribution: Sodium distribution varies according to the tissues: fast in muscle, liver, kidney, cartilage and skin, slow in erythrocytes and neurons, and very slow in bone. Chloride is mainly distributed in extracellular fluids. Biotransformation: The half-life after injection of radioactively labeled sodium (24Na) is 11-13 days for 99% of the injected sodium and one year for the remaining 1%.

                     <br/>
Chloride closely follows sodium metabolism and changes in the body's acid-base balance are reflected by changes in chloride concentration. Elimination: Sodium is mainly excreted renally, but also the majority is reabsorbed renally. Small amounts of sodium are excreted in feces and sweat. Since chloride follows sodium metabolically, it is mainly excreted renally, and small amounts in feces and sweat. Linearity / non-linearity: When the electrolytes in the composition of TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE are administered in the amount that will compensate for their deficiencies in the body, i.e. in therapeutic doses, it exhibits a linear pharmacokinetic behavior.

Preclinical safety data Since the components of the solution are physiological components of human and animal plasma and toxic effects are not expected in clinical application, studies have not been conducted with isotonic sodium chloride solutions to evaluate their carcinogenic, mutagenic potential and effects on fertility. The safety of drugs added to the solution should be considered separately.

Incompatibilities
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The compatibility of the drug to be added to the solution should be evaluated in advance. In cases where compatibility data are not available, no drug should be added to the solution. It is the responsibility of the physician performing the application to check whether the added drug is compatible by checking whether there is a color change and/or precipitation, insoluble compounds or crystallization after the drug is added. The compatibility of the drug to be added to TURKFLEKS %0.9 ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE should be decided by using the product information of the drug to be added. Before adding the drug to the solution, it should be confirmed that TURKFLEKS %0.9 ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE is soluble and stable at its pH.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <br/>
