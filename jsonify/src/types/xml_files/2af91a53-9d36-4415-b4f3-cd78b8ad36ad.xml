               <text>
                  <paragraph ID="ID333">The combination treatment regimen of psoralen (P) and ultraviolet radiation of 320-400 nm wavelength commonly referred to as UVA is known by the acronym, PUVA. Skin reactivity to UVA (320–400 nm) radiation is markedly enhanced by the ingestion of methoxsalen. In a well controlled bioavailability study, Methoxsalen Capsules, USP 10 mg [Soft Gelatin Capsules] reached peak drug levels in the blood of test subjects between 0.5 and 4 hours (Mean = 1.8 hours) as compared to between 1.5 and 6 hours (Mean = 3.0 hours) for regular hard gelatin capsule when administered with 8 ounces of milk. Peak drug levels were 2 to 3-fold greater when the overall extent of drug absorption was approximately 2-fold greater for Methoxsalen Capsules, USP 10 mg [Soft Gelatin Capsules] as compared to regular hard gelatin capsules. Detectable methoxsalen levels were observed up to 12 hours post dose. The drug half-life is approximately 2 hours. Photosensitivity studies demonstrate a shorter time of peak photosensitivity of 1.5 to 2.1 hours vs. 3.9 to 4.25 hours for regular hard gelatin capsules. In addition, the mean minimal erythema dose (MED), J/cm<sup>2</sup>, for the Methoxsalen Capsules, USP 10 mg [Soft Gelatin Capsules] is substantially less than that required for regular hard gelatin capsule (Levins et al., 1984 and private communication<sup>1</sup>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Methoxsalen is reversibly bound to serum albumin and is also preferentially taken up by epidermal cells (Artuc et al., 1979<sup>2</sup>). At a dose which is 6 times larger than that used in humans, it induces mixed function oxidases in the liver of mice (Mandula et al., 1978<sup>3</sup>). In both mice and man, methoxsalen is rapidly metabolized. Approximately 95% of the drug is excreted as a series of metabolites in the urine within 24 hours (Pathak et al., 1977<sup>4</sup>). The exact mechanism of action of methoxsalen with the epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes is not known. The best known biochemical reaction of methoxsalen is with DNA. Methoxsalen, upon photoactivation, conjugates and forms covalent bonds with DNA which leads to the formation of both monofunctional (addition to a single strand of DNA) and bifunctional (crosslinking of psoralen to both strands of DNA) adducts (Dall' Acqua et al., 1971<sup>5</sup>; Cole, 1970<sup>6</sup>; Musajo et al., 1974<sup>7</sup>; Dall' Acqua et al., 1979<sup>8</sup>). Reactions with proteins have also been described (Yoshikawa, et al., 1979<sup>9</sup>).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Methoxsalen acts as a photosensitizer. Administration of the drug and subsequent exposure to UVA can lead to cell injury. Orally administered methoxsalen reaches the skin via the blood and UVA penetrates well into the skin. If sufficient cell injury occurs in the skin, an inflammatory reaction occurs. The most obvious manifestation of this reaction is delayed erythema, which may not begin for several hours and peaks at 48-72 hours. The inflammation is followed, over several days to weeks, by repair which is manifested by increased melanization of the epidermis and thickening of the stratum corneum. The mechanisms of therapy are not known. In the treatment of psoriasis, the mechanism is most often assumed to be DNA photodamage and resulting decrease in cell proliferation but other vascular, leukocyte, or cell regulatory mechanisms may also be playing some role. Psoriasis is a hyperproliferative disorder and other agents known to be therapeutic for psoriasis are known to inhibit DNA synthesis.</paragraph>

                     <title>B. CARCINOGENICITY:</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID377">ANIMAL STUDIES: Topical or intraperitoneal methoxsalen has been reported to be a potent photocarcinogen in albino mice and hairless mice (Hakim et al., 1960<sup>10</sup>). However, methoxsalen given by the oral route to Swiss albino mice suggests this agent exerts a protective effect against ultraviolet carcinogenesis; mice given 8-methoxypsoralen in their diet showed 38% ear tumors 180 days after the start of ultraviolet therapy compared to 62% for controls (O'Neal et al., 1957<sup>11</sup>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>HUMAN STUDIES: A 5.7 year prospective study of 1380 psoriasis patients treated with oral methoxsalen and ultraviolet A photochemotherapy (PUVA) demonstrated that the risk of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma developing at least 22 months following the first PUVA exposure was approximately 12.8 times higher in the high dose patients than in the low dose patients (Stern et al., 1979<sup>12</sup>, Stern et al., 1980<sup>13</sup>, and Stern et al., 1984<sup>14</sup>). The substantial dose-dependent increase was observed in patients with neither a prior history of skin cancer nor significant exposure to cutaneous carcinogens. Reduction in PUVA dosage significantly reduces the risk. No substantial dose-related increase was noted for basal cell carcinoma according to Stern et al., 1984<sup>14</sup>. Increases appear greatest in patients who have pre-PUVA exposure to 1) prolonged tar and UVB treatment, 2) ionizing radiation, or 3) arsenic. Roenigk et al., 1980<sup>15</sup>, studied 690 patients for up to 4 years and found no increase in the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer, although patients in this cohort had significantly less exposure to PUVA than in the Stern et al. study. Recent analysis of new data in the Stern et al cohort (Stern et al., 1997<sup>16</sup>) has shown that these patients have an elevated relative risk of contracting melanoma. The relative risk for melanoma in these patients was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 4.1). The risk is particularly higher in those patients who have received more than 250 PUVA treatments and in those whose treatment has spanned greater than 15 years earlier. Some patients developing melanoma did so even after having ceased PUVA therapy over 5 years earlier. These observations indicate the need for monitoring of PUVA patients for skin tumors throughout their lives. In a study in Indian patients treated for 4 years for vitiligo, 12% developed keratoses, but not cancer, in the depigmented, vitiliginous areas (Mosher, 1980<sup>17</sup>). Clinically, the keratoses were keratotic papules, actinic keratosis-like macules, nonscaling dome-shaped papules, and lichenoid porokeratotic-like papules.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID378">ANIMAL STUDIES: Exposure to large doses of UVA causes cataracts in animals, and this effect is enhanced by the administration of methoxsalen (Cloud et al., 1960<sup>18</sup>; Cloud et al., 1961<sup>19</sup> Freeman et al., 1969<sup>20</sup>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>HUMAN STUDIES: It has been found that the concentration of methoxsalen in the lens is proportional to the serum level. If the lens is exposed to UVA during the time methoxsalen is present in the lens, photochemical action may lead to irreversible binding of methoxsalen to proteins and the DNA components of the lens (Lerman et al., 1980<sup>21</sup>). However, if the lens is shielded from UVA, the methoxsalen will diffuse out of the lens in a 24-hour period (Lerman et al., 1980<sup>21</sup>). Patients should be told emphatically to wear UVA absorbing, wrap-around sunglasses for the 24-hour period following ingestion of methoxsalen whether exposed to direct or indirect sunlight in the open or through a window glass. Among patients using proper eye protection, there is no evidence for a significantly increased risk of cataracts in association with PUVA therapy (Stern et al., 1979<sup>12</sup>). Thirty-five of 1380 patients have developed cataracts in the 5 years since their first PUVA treatment. This incidence is comparable to that expected in a population of this size and age distribution. No relationship between PUVA dose and cataract risk in this group has been noted.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients must not sunbathe during the 24 hours prior to methoxsalen ingestion and UV exposure. The presence of a sunburn may prevent an accurate evaluation of the patient's response to photochemotherapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>AFTER METHOXSALEN INGESTION</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>UVA-absorbing wrap-around sunglasses should be worn during daylight for 24 hours after methoxsalen ingestion. The protective eyewear must be designed to prevent entry of stray radiation to the eyes, including that which may enter from the sides of the eyewear. The protective eyewear is used to prevent the irreversible binding of methoxsalen to the proteins and DNA components of the lens. Cataracts form when enough of the binding occurs. Visual discrimination should be permitted by the eyewear of patient well-being and comfort.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients must avoid sun exposure, even through window glass or cloud cover, for at least 8 hours after methoxsalen ingestion. If sun exposure cannot be avoided, the patient should wear protective devices such as a hat and gloves, and/or apply sunscreens which contain ingredients that filter out UVA radiation (e.g., sunscreens containing benzophenone and/or PABA esters which exhibit a sun protective factor equal to or greater than 15). These chemical sunscreens should be applied to all areas that might be exposed to the sun (including lips). Sunscreens should not be applied to areas affected by psoriasis until after the patient has been treated in the UVA chamber.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DURING PUVA THERAPY</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Total UVA-absorbing/blocking goggles mechanically designed to give maximal ocular protection must be worn. Failure to do so may increase the risk of cataract formation. A reliable radiometer can be used to verify elimination of UVA transmission through the goggles.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abdominal skin, breasts, genitalia, and other sensitive areas should be protected for approximately 1/3 of the initial exposure time until tanning occurs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Unless affected by disease, male genitalia should be shielded.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>AFTER COMBINED METHOXSALEN/UVA THERAPY</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>UVA-absorbing wrap-around sunglasses should be worn during daylight for 24 hours after combined methoxsalen/UVA therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should not sunbathe for 48 hours after therapy. Erythema and/or burning due to photochemotherapy and sunburn due to sun exposure are additive.</paragraph>

In most cases, pruritus can be alleviated with frequent application of bland emollients or other topical agents; severe pruritus may require systemic treatment. If pruritus is unresponsive to these measures, shield pruritic areas from further UVA exposure until the condition resolves. If intractable pruritus is generalized, UVA treatment should be discontinued until the pruritus disappears.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ERYTHEMA: Mild, transient erythema at 24-48 hours after PUVA therapy is an expected reaction and indicates that a therapeutic interaction between methoxsalen and UVA occurred. Any area showing moderate erythema (greater than Grade 2 - See <linkHtml href="#ID305">Table 1</linkHtml> for grades of erythema) should be shielded during subsequent UVA exposures until the erythema has resolved. Erythema greater than Grade 2 which appears within 24 hours after UVA treatment may signal a potentially severe burn. Erythema may become progressively worse over the next 24 hours, since the peak erythemal reaction characteristically occurs 48 hours or later after methoxsalen ingestion. The patient should be protected from further UVA exposures and sunlight, and should be monitored closely.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PUVA ERYTHEMA AND SUNBURN: PUVA-induced inflammation differs from sunburn or UVB phototherapy in several ways. The % transmission of UVB varies between 0% to 34% through skin whereas UVA varies between 1% to 80% transmission; thus, UVA is transmitted to a larger % through the skin. (Diffey, 1982<sup>22</sup>). The DNA lesions induced by PUVA are very different from UV-induced thymine dimers and may lead to a DNA crosslink. This DNA lesion may be more problematic to the cell because crosslinks are more lethal and psoralen-DNA photoproducts may be "new" or unfamiliar substrates for DNA repair enzymes. DNA synthesis is also suppressed longer after PUVA. The time course of delayed erythema is different with PUVA and may not involve the usual mediators seen in sunburn. PUVA-induced redness may be just beginning at 24 hours, when UVB erythema has already passed its peak. The erythema dose-response curve is also steeper for PUVA. Compared to equally erythemogenic doses of UVB, the histologic alterations induced by PUVA show more dermal vessel damage and longer duration of epidermal and dermal abnormalities.</paragraph>

This new dosage form of methoxsalen exhibits significantly greater bioavailability and earlier photosensitization onset time than previous methoxsalen dosage forms. Each patient should be evaluated by determining the minimum phototoxic dose (MPD) and phototoxic peak time after drug administration prior to onset of photochemotherapy with this dosage form. Human bioavailability studies have indicated the following drug dosage and administration directions are to be used as a guideline only.</paragraph>

In no case should treatments be given more often than once every other day because the full extent of phototoxic reactions may not be evident until 48 hours after each exposure.</paragraph>

The patient or operator should not be able to touch any live electrical parts. There should be ground fault protection. (2) Protective shielding of lamps: The patient should not be able to come in contact with the bare lamps. In the event of lamp breakage, the patient should not be exposed to broken lamp components. (3) Hand rails and hand holds: Appropriate supports should be available to the patient. (4) Patient viewing window: A window which blocks UV should be provided for viewing the patient during treatment. (5) Door and latches: Patients should be able to open the door from the inside with only slight pressure to the door. (6) Non-skid floor: The floor should be of a non-skid nature. (7) Thermoregulation: Sufficient air flow should be provided for patient safety and comfort, limiting temperature within the UVA radiator cabinet to approximately less than 100 °F. (8) Timer: The irradiator should be equipped with an automatic timer which terminates the exposure at the conclusion of a pre-set time interval. (9) Patient alarm device: An alarm device within the UVA irradiator chamber should be accessible to the patient for emergency activation. (10) Danger label: The unit should have a label prominently displayed which reads as follows:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DANGER - Ultraviolet radiation - Follow your physicians instructions - Failure to use protective eyewear may result in eye injury.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID283">The maximum radiant exposure or irradiance (within ±15%) of UVA (320-400 nm) delivered to the patient should be determined by using an appropriate radiometer calibrated to be read in J/cm<sup>2</sup> or mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. In the absence of a standard measuring technique approved by the National Bureau of Standards, the system should use a detector corrected to a cosine spatial response. The use and recalibration frequency of such a radiometer for a specific UVA irradiator chamber should be specified by the manufacturer because the UVA dose (exposure) is determined by the design of the irradiator, the number of lamps, and the age of the lamp. If irradiance is measured, the radiometer reading in mW/cm<sup>2</sup> is used to calculate the exposure time in minutes to deliver the required UVA in J/cm<sup>2</sup> to a patient in the UVA irradiator cabinet. The equation is:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Exposure Time         Desired UVA Dose (J/cm<sup>2</sup>)</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>  (minutes)          =  -------------------------------------</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>                                   0.06 x Irradiance (mW/cm<sup>2</sup>)</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Overexposure due to human error should be minimized by using an accurate automatic timing device, which is set by the operator and controlled by energizing and de-energizing the UVA irradiator lamp. The timing device calibration interval should be specified by the manufacturer. Safety systems should be included to minimize the possibility of delivering a UVA exposure which exceeds the prescribed dose, in the event the timer or radiometer should malfunction.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID356">Specific recommendations for patient treatment are as follows:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>SKIN TYPES I, II, &amp; III. Patients with skin types I, II, and III may be treated 2 or 3 times per week. UVA exposure may be held constant or increased by up to 1.0 J/cm<sup>2</sup> at each treatment, according to the patient's response. If erythema occurs, however, do not increase exposure time until erythema resolves. The severity and extent of the patient's erythema may be used to determine whether the next exposure should be shortened, omitted, or maintained at the previous dosage. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.)</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>SKIN TYPES IV, V, &amp; VI. Patients with skin types IV, V, and VI may be treated 2 or 3 times per week. UVA exposure may be held constant or increased by up to 1.5 J/cm<sup>2</sup> at each treatment unless erythema occurs. If erythema occurs, follow instructions outlined above in the procedures for patients with skin types I, II, and III.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ERYTHRODERMIC PSORIASIS. Patients with erythrodermic psoriasis should be treated with special attention because pre-existing erythema may obscure observations of possible treatment-related phototoxic erythema. These patients may be treated 2 or 3 times per week, as a Type I patient.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>MISCELLANEOUS SITUATIONS:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If there is no response after a total of 10 treatments, the exposure of UVA energy may be increased by an additional 0.5–1.0 J/cm<sup>2</sup> above the prior incremental increases for each treatment. (Example: a patient whose exposure dosage is being increased by 1.0 J/cm<sup>2</sup> may now have all subsequent doses increased by 1.5–2.0 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.)</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If there is no response, or only minimal response, after 15 treatments, the dosage of methoxsalen may be increased by 10 mg (a one-time increase in dosage). This increased dosage may be continued for the remainder of the course of treatment but should not be exceeded.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a patient misses a treatment, the UVA exposure time of the next treatment should not be increased. If more than one treatment is missed, reduce the exposure by 0.5 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for each treatment missed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the lower extremities are not responding as well as the rest of the body and do not show erythema, cover all other body areas and give 25 % of the present exposure dose as an additional exposure to the lower extremities. This additional exposure to the lower extremities should be terminated if erythema develops on these areas.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Non-responsive psoriasis: If a patient's generalized psoriasis is not responding, or if the condition appears to be worsening during treatment, the possibility of a generalized phototoxic reaction should be considered. This may be confirmed by the improvement of the condition following temporary discontinuance of this therapy for two weeks. If no improvement occurs during the interruption of treatment, this patient may be considered a treatment failure.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph ID="ID296">As an alternative to increasing the UVA exposure at each treatment, the following schedule may be followed; this schedule may reduce the total number of J/cm<sup>2</sup> received by the patient over the entire course of therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Incremental increases in UVA exposure for all patients may range from 0.5 to 1.5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, according to the patient's response to therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Once Grade 2 clearing (see <linkHtml href="#ID306">Table 2</linkHtml>) has been reached and the patient is progressing adequately, UVA dosage is held constant. This dosage is maintained until Grade 4 clearing is reached.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the rate of clearing significantly decreases, exposure dosage may be increased at each treatment (0.1-1.5 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) until Grade 3 clearing and a satisfactory progress rate is attained. The UVA exposure will be held constant again until Grade 4 clearing is attained. These increases may be used also if the rate of clearing significantly decreases between Grade 3 and Grade 4 response. However, the possibility of a phototoxic reaction should be considered; see Non-responsive Psoriasis, above.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In summary, this schedule raises slightly the increments (J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of UVA dosage, but limits these increases to those periods when the patient is not responding adequately. Otherwise, the UVA exposure is held at the lowest effective dose.</paragraph>

Erythema: During maintenance therapy, the patient's tan and threshold dose for erythema may gradually decrease. If maintenance treatments produce significant erythema, the exposure to UVA should be decreased by 25% until further treatments no longer produce erythema.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>b. Psoriasis: If the patient develops new areas of psoriasis during maintenance therapy (but still is classified as having a Grade 4 response), the exposure to UVA may be increased by 0.5-1.5 J/cm<sup>2</sup> at each treatment; this is appropriate for all types of patients. These increases are continued until the psoriasis is brought under control and the patient is again clear. The exposure being administered when this clearing is reached should be used for further maintenance treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>FLARES DURING MAINTENANCE: If the patient flares during maintenance treatment (i.e., develops psoriasis on more than 5% of the originally involved areas of the body), this maintenance treatment schedule may be changed to the preceding maintenance or clearing schedule. The patient may be kept on his schedule until again 95 % clear. If the original maintenance treatment schedule is unable to control the psoriasis, the schedule may be changed to a more frequent regimen. If a flare occurs less than 6 weeks after the last treatment, 25 % of the maximum exposure received during the clearing phase, with the clearing schedule received during the clearing phase, may be used and then proceed with the clearing schedule previously followed for this patient. (At 95% clearing, follow regular maintenance until the optimum maintenance schedule is determined for the patient.) If more than 6 weeks have elapsed since the last treatment was given, treat patients as if they were beginning therapy insofar as exposure dosages are concerned, since their threshold for erythema may have decreased. </paragraph>
