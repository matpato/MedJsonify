                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour oxycodone hydrochloride tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour oxycodone hydrochloride tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose. If a patient has been receiving opioid-containing medications prior to taking oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, the potency of the prior opioid relative to oxycodone should be factored into the selection of the total daily dose (TDD) of oxycodone. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In converting patients from other opioids to oxycodone hydrochloride tablets close observation and adjustment of dosage based upon the patient’s response to oxycodone hydrochloride tablets is imperative. Administration of supplemental analgesia for breakthrough or incident pain and titration of the total daily dose of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets may be necessary, especially in patients who have disease states that are changing rapidly. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> When converting patients from fixed ratio opioid/non-opioid drug regimens a decision should be made whether or not to continue the non-opioid analgesic. If a decision is made to discontinue the use of non-opioid analgesic, it may be necessary to titrate the dose of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets in response to the level of analgesia and adverse effects afforded by the dosing regimen. If the non-opioid regimen is continued as a separate single entity agent, the starting dose oxycodone hydrochloride tablets should be based upon the most recent dose of opioid as a baseline for further titration of oxycodone. Incremental increases should be gauged according to side effects to an acceptable level of analgesia. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> The relative bioavailability of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets compared to extended-release oxycodone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release oxycodone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue oxycodone hydrochloride tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including oxycodone hydrochloride tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on oxycodone hydrochloride tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Abuse and Dependence (<linkHtml href="#LINK_2a2ec288-df37-4510-8020-4403e6a5f8e5">9.3</linkHtml>)]</content>.  </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph> Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets contain oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, oxycodone hydrochloride tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Abuse and Dependence (<linkHtml href="#LINK_2b8c2883-7aa3-421a-9448-1c535ccbf9e8">9</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed oxycodone hydrochloride tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Assess each patient’s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, and reassess all patients receiving oxycodone hydrochloride tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#_c2e74bb3-a987-e2e5-bf48-8835d8230bd5">2.2</linkHtml>), Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#_723ed7d3-6ca4-fdbe-f544-af66a7e88a5d">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing oxycodone hydrochloride tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and on the proper disposal of unused drugs. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph> Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient’s clinical status <content styleCode="italics">[see Overdosage (<linkHtml href="#LINK_f6fd962b-f628-433f-86eb-f3aa2e3ed599">10</linkHtml>)]</content>. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets are essential <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#LINK_94109e27-eafa-4c0d-8722-491533474dd5">2</linkHtml>)]</content>.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_579c94f3-8ef1-49d7-b024-175fbf7bea78">7</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph> To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to <content styleCode="underline">www.opioidanalgesicrems.com</content>.

                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of oxycodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_374fdca1-d720-41d2-b72b-d6bc9e71ac8f">5.3</linkHtml>)],</content> particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in oxycodone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients may increase oxycodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect <content styleCode="italics">[see Dependence (<linkHtml href="#LINK_2a2ec288-df37-4510-8020-4403e6a5f8e5">9.3</linkHtml>)]</content>. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety)<content styleCode="italics"> [see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#LINK_2d025d64-0af7-4dd1-93b3-41efb02582d6">2.5</linkHtml>), Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_7f3b8007-f741-49f0-ad52-45b48a54167f">5.14</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets have been evaluated in open label clinical trials in patients with cancer and nonmalignant pain. Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets are associated with adverse experiences similar to those seen with other opioids.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious adverse reactions associated with oxycodone hydrochloride tablets use included: respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, cardiac arrest, hypotension, and/or shock.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The common adverse reactions seen on initiation of therapy with oxycodone hydrochloride tablets are dose related and are typical opioid-related adverse reactions. The most frequent of these included nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, pruritus, insomnia, dizziness, asthenia, and somnolence. The frequency of these reactions depended on several factors, including clinical setting, the patient’s level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the individual.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In all patients for whom dosing information was available (n=191) from the open-label and double-blind studies involving oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, the following adverse events were recorded in oxycodone hydrochloride tablets treated patients with an incidence ≥3%. In descending order of frequency they were: nausea, constipation, vomiting, headache, pruritus, insomnia, dizziness, asthenia, and somnolence.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Other less frequently observed adverse reactions from opioid analgesics, including oxycodone hydrochloride tablets included:</paragraph>

An opioid antagonist such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from lactation studies indicate that oxycodone is present in breastmilk and that doses of less than 60 mg/day of the immediate-release formulation are unlikely to result in clinically relevant exposures in breastfed infants. A pharmacokinetics study utilizing opportunistic sampling of 76 lactating women receiving oxycodone immediate-release products for postpartum pain management showed that oxycodone concentrates in breastmilk with an average milk to plasma ratio of 3.2. The relative infant dose was low, approximately 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose (<content styleCode="italics">see Data</content>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the same study, among the 70 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk, no adverse events were attributed to oxycodone. However, based on known adverse effects in adults, infants should be monitored for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression (<content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Considerations</content>). There are no data on the effects of the oxycodone on milk production. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for oxycodone hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from oxycodone hydrochloride tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone concentration data from 76 lactating women receiving immediate-release oxycodone products for postpartum pain management, and 28 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk showed that following a median (range) dose of oxycodone in mothers of 9.2 (5-10) mg/dose or 33.0 (5.4-59.3) mg/day, oxycodone concentrated in breastmilk with a median (range) milk to plasma ratio of 3.2 (1.2-5.3). However, when using maternal breastmilk data to estimate the daily and relative infant dose, the infant dose was 0.006 mg/kg/day, which is 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose of 10 mg every 6 hours. These estimates based on maternal breastmilk concentrations were corroborated by the observed infant concentrations, of which over 75% (19/25) were below the limit of quantification. Among the 6 infants with quantifiable concentration, the median (range) concentration was 0.2 ng/mL (0.1-0.7). These concentrations are 100 to 1000 times lower than concentrations observed in other studies after infants received oxycodone at 0.1 mg/kg/dose (~20-200 ng/mL).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, 20.8% (112/538) were 65 and over, while 7.2% (39/538) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to oxycodone. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_374fdca1-d720-41d2-b72b-d6bc9e71ac8f">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxycodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets contain oxycodone, a substance with a high potential for misuse and abuse, which can lead to the development of substance use disorder, including addiction <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_94d0bd3a-8ae4-440e-b48b-842ade480030">5.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a healthcare provider or for whom it was not prescribed. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Misuse and abuse of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets increases risk of overdose, which may lead to central nervous system and respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, and death. The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets with alcohol and/or other CNS depressants. Abuse of and addiction to opioids in some individuals may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of addiction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients treated with opioids require careful and frequent reevaluation for signs of misuse, abuse, and addiction, because use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use. Patients at high risk of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets abuse include those with a history of prolonged use of any opioid, including products containing oxycodone, those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse, or those who use oxycodone hydrochloride tablets in combination with other abused drugs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>“Drug-seeking” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders. Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated “loss” of prescriptions, tampering with prescriptions, and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating healthcare provider(s). “Doctor shopping” (visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions) is common among people who abuse drugs and people with substance use disorder. Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with inadequate pain control.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, like other opioids, can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels of distribution. Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic reevaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Do not abruptly discontinue oxycodone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When discontinuing oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#LINK_8669e8bf-38dd-430a-ba06-ada4c006208c">2.4</linkHtml>), and Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_7f3b8007-f741-49f0-ad52-45b48a54167f">5.14</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Acute overdose with oxycodone can be manifested by respiratory depression, somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupils, and in some cases, pulmonary edema, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, partial or complete airway obstruction, atypical snoring, and death. Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#LINK_6bed2f55-21d1-4f92-8d05-cea5c21add2b">12.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In case of overdose, priorities are the re-establishment of a patent and protected airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation, if needed. Employ other supportive measures (including oxygen and vasopressors) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life-support measures.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Opioid antagonists, such as naloxone, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose. For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to opioid overdose, administer an opioid antagonist.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of oxycodone in oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished. If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product’s prescribing information.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered. If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be initiated with care and by titration with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</paragraph>

                     <title>12.1 Mechanism of Action</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Oxycodone is a full opioid agonist and is relatively selective for the mu-opioid receptor, although it can bind to other opioid receptors at higher doses. The principal therapeutic action of oxycodone is analgesia. Like all full opioid agonists, there is no ceiling effect for analgesia with oxycodone. Clinically, dosage is titrated to provide adequate analgesia and may be limited by adverse reactions, including respiratory and CNS depression.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism of the analgesic action is unknown. However, specific CNS opioid receptors for endogenous compounds with opioid-like activity have been identified throughout the brain and spinal cord and are thought to play a role in the analgesic effects of this drug.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oxycodone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone produces peripheral vasodilatation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilatation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormone (LH) in humans <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_375bb20a-147d-4415-ae4c-d1331dbedecf">6.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_375bb20a-147d-4415-ae4c-d1331dbedecf">6.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of oxycodone for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome, and/or the development of analgesic tolerance <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#LINK_597a4b51-3ee4-49dd-a13b-aa2632ac2303">2.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_8669e8bf-38dd-430a-ba06-ada4c006208c">2.3</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is a relationship between increasing oxycodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression.

                        <paragraph>About 60% to 87% of an oral dose of oxycodone reaches the systemic circulation in comparison to a parenteral dose. This high oral bioavailability (compared to other oral opioids) is due to lower presystemic and/or first-pass metabolism of oxycodone. The relative oral bioavailability of oxycodone hydrochloride 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, compared to the 5 mg oxycodone hydrochloride tablets, is 96% and 101% respectively. Oxycodone hydrochloride 15 mg tablets and 30 mg tablets are bioequivalent to the 5 mg oxycodone hydrochloride tablet (<content styleCode="italics">see</content> Table 2 for pharmacokinetic parameters). Dose proportionality of oxycodone has been established using the oxycodone hydrochloride 5 mg tablets at doses of 5 mg, 15 mg (three 5 mg tablets) and 30 mg (six 5 mg tablets) based on extent of absorption (AUC) (<content styleCode="italics">see </content>Figure 1). It takes approximately 18 to 24 hours to reach steady-state plasma concentrations of oxycodone with oxycodone hydrochloride tablets.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A single-dose food effect study was conducted in normal volunteers using the 5 mg/5 mL solution. The concurrent intake of a high fat meal was shown to enhance the extent (27% increase in AUC), but not the rate of oxycodone absorption from the oral solution (<content styleCode="italics">see</content> Table 2). In addition, food caused a delay in T<sub>max</sub> (1.25 to 2.54 hour). Similar effects of food are expected with the 15 mg and 30 mg tablets.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A high portion of oxycodone is N-dealkylated to noroxycodone during first-pass metabolism, and is catalyzed by CYP3A4. Oxymorphone is formed by the O-demethylation of oxycodone. The metabolism of oxycodone to oxymorphone is catalyzed by CYP2D6 <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_579c94f3-8ef1-49d7-b024-175fbf7bea78">7</linkHtml>)]</content>. Free and conjugated noroxycodone, free and conjugated oxycodone, and oxymorphone are excreted in human urine following a single oral dose of oxycodone. The major circulating metabolite is noroxycodone with an AUC ratio of 0.6 relative to that of oxycodone. Oxymorphone is present in the plasma only in low concentrations. The analgesic activity profile of other metabolites is not known at present.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oxycodone and its metabolites are excreted primarily via the kidney. The amounts measured in the urine have been reported as follows: free oxycodone up to 19%; conjugated oxycodone up to 50%; free oxymorphone 0%; conjugated oxymorphone ≤14%; both free and conjugated noroxycodone have been found in the urine but not quantified. The total plasma clearance was 0.8 L/min for adults. Apparent elimination half-life of oxycodone following the administration of oxycodone hydrochloride tablets was 3.5 to 4 hours.</paragraph>
