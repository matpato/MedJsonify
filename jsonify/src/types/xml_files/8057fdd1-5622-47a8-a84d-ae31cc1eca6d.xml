                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Using aseptic technique, withdraw 2.3 mL of preservative-free Sterile Water for Injection through an 18-gauge, 1- or 1Â½-inch needle attached to a 3-mL syringe and inject the preservative-free Sterile Water for Injection, USP, into the drug product vial for reconstitution. The needle and syringe used for reconstitution with preservative-free Sterile Water for Injection, USP, should then be discarded and should not be used for subcutaneous injections. After the addition of preservative-free Sterile Water for Injection, USP, reconstitute the vial contents by shaking the vial for approximately one minute and then allowing it to sit for one minute. The resulting 80mg/mL solution is sufficient to allow a withdrawal volume of up to 2 mL for subcutaneous administration. The reconstituted solution is viscous, clear, colorless to pale yellow, and free from particulates. Prior to injection, inspect the reconstituted solution for any discoloration or particulate matter. Discard the solution if either is observed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Using aseptic technique, withdraw the recommended dose volume, up to 2 mL (160 mg), of the solution with a new 18-gauge, 1- or 1Â½-inch needle attached to a new 3-mL syringe. For the subcutaneous injection, replace the needle with a new 26-gauge, Â½-inch needle.  EACH VIAL SHOULD BE USED FOR A SINGLE DOSE ONLY. Discard the vial after withdrawal of drug.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>After reconstitution, ARCALYST may be kept at room temperature, but keep it protected from light, and use the solution within three hours after reconstitution. Discard unused portions of ARCALYST.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Rotate the sites for subcutaneous injection, such as the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. Injections should never be administered at sites that are bruised, red, tender, or hard.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Interleukin-1 (IL-1) blockade may interfere with the immune response to infections. Treatment with another medication that works through inhibition of IL-1 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and serious infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S14">Clinical Studies (14)</linkHtml>]</content>. There was a greater incidence of infections in CAPS and RP patients on ARCALYST compared with placebo.</paragraph>

In an open-label extension study in CAPS, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical studies, ARCALYST has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of an IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. <content styleCode="bold">ARCALYST is not recommended for use with TNF inhibitors because this may increase the risk of serious infections.</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). It is possible that taking drugs such as ARCALYST that block IL-1 increases the risk of TB or other atypical or opportunistic infections.

                        <paragraph>Since no data are available on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST, avoid administration of live vaccines during treatment with ARCALYST.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST. Since ARCALYST may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens, vaccines may not be effective in patients receiving ARCALYST.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because IL-1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections, it is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST, adult and pediatric patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as per current immunization guidelines, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to the rilonacept receptor domains in specific assays. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to rilonacept with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in patients with CAPS after treatment with ARCALYST. Nineteen of 55 patients (35%) who had received ARCALYST for at least 6 weeks tested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies on at least one occasion. Of the 19, seven tested positive at the last assessment (Week 18 or 24 of the open-label extension period), and five patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies on at least one occasion. There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical effectiveness or safety.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the Phase 3 study of patients with RP, there were no patients who tested positive for antibodies at baseline. At any point in time, 26 out of 86 (30%) subjects tested positive at any assessment and of these, 6 tested positive for neutralizing antibodies (NAb). At the last assessment, 10 subjects remained positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and 1 subject remained positive for NAb. There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical effectiveness or safety.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ARCALYST. Concomitant administration of another drug that blocks IL-1 with a TNF-blocking agent in another patient population has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and an increased risk of neutropenia. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with TNF-blocking agents may also result in similar toxicities and is not recommended <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with other drugs that block IL-1 has not been studied. Based upon the potential for pharmacologic interactions between rilonacept and a recombinant IL-1ra, concomitant administration of ARCALYST and other agents that block IL-1 or its receptors is not recommended.</paragraph>

                     <title>7.2	Cytochrome P450 Substrates</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1) during chronic inflammation. Thus it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL-1, such as rilonacept, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g., warfarin). Upon initiation of ARCALYST in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or drug concentration should be performed, and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Rare pregnancy outcomes reported postmarketing and from clinical trials, with very limited use of ARCALYST in pregnant women, are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There may be risks to the mother and fetus associated with Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#CC">Clinical Considerations</linkHtml>)</content>. In an animal reproduction study, subcutaneous administration of rilonacept to pregnant monkeys during the period of organogenesis was complicated by losses of drug exposure as the study progressed, due to anti-drug antibody formation at all doses, but a dose-related increase in exposure was still evident. There were no treatment-related effects on fetal survival or development of malformations with doses up to 11 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Increased incidences of lumbar ribs, a skeletal variation, were observed in fetuses at doses approximately 2 times the MRHD and higher that slightly exceeded incidences in both control animals and the historical control database (<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#data">Data</linkHtml>
                                 </content>). There were findings of multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic vertebral bodies and arches in one fetus of the only pregnant monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation associated with a dose approximately 6 times the MRHD (<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#data">Data</linkHtml>
                                 </content>). The relationship of these findings in a single fetus to drug treatment was unclear, as these findings were not evident in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that had higher exposures to rilonacept during the period of organogenesis associated with a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%â4% and of miscarriage is 15%â20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys received rilonacept at subcutaneous doses of 0, 5, 15 or 30 mg/kg given twice a week from gestation days 20 to 48. The study was complicated by losses of drug exposure as the study progressed, due to anti-drug antibody formation at all doses, but a dose-related increase in exposure was still evident. There were no treatment-related effects on fetal survival or development of malformations with doses up to 11 times the MRHD (on a mg/kg basis with maternal subcutaneous doses up to 30 mg/kg). Increased incidences of lumbar ribs, a skeletal variation, were observed in fetuses at doses approximately 2 times the MRHD and higher (on a mg/kg basis with maternal subcutaneous doses of 5 mg/kg and higher) that slightly exceeded incidences in both control animals and the historical control database. There were findings of multiple fusion and absence of the ribs and thoracic vertebral bodies and arches in one fetus of the only pregnant monkey with exposure to rilonacept during the later period of gestation associated with a dose 6 times the MRHD (on a mg/kg basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 15 mg/kg). The relationship of these findings in a single fetus to drug treatment was unclear, as these findings were not evident in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that had higher exposures to rilonacept during the period of organogenesis associated with a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on a mg/kg basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mg/kg). All doses of rilonacept reduced maternal serum levels of estradiol up to 64% compared to controls. In pre- and postnatal development studies in the mouse model using a murine analog of rilonacept (subcutaneous doses of 0, 20, 100 or 200 mg/kg), there was a small increase in the number of stillbirths in dams treated with 200 mg/kg three times per week.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Six pediatric patients with CAPS between the ages of 12 and 16 were treated with ARCALYST at a weekly subcutaneous dose of 2.2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 160 mg) for 24 weeks during the open-label extension phase. These patients showed improvement from baseline in their symptom scores and in objective markers of inflammation (e.g., Serum Amyloid A and C-Reactive Protein). The adverse reactions included injection-site reactions and upper respiratory symptoms as were commonly seen in adult patients.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The trough drug levels for four pediatric patients measured at the end of the weekly dose interval (mean 20 mcg/mL, range 3.6 to 33 mcg/mL) were similar to those observed in adult patients with CAPS (mean 24 mcg/mL, range 7 to 56 mcg/mL).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the Phase 3 study RHAPSODY, 7 patients aged 12 years to 17 years were treated with ARCALYST subcutaneously with an initial loading dose of 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 320 mg) followed by 2.2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 160 mg) weekly. These patients were treated for a median time of 15 weeks. There were no apparent differences in efficacy, safety or tolerability across age groups.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>When administered to pregnant primates, rilonacept treatment may have contributed to alterations in bone ossification in the fetus. It is not known if ARCALYST will alter bone development in pediatric patients.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Rilonacept is an interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1Î±) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²) cytokine trap.  Rilonacept blocks IL-1 signaling by acting as a soluble decoy receptor that binds both IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² and prevents its interaction with cell surface receptors. Rilonacept also binds interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra).  The equilibrium dissociation constants for rilonacept binding to IL-1Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-1ra were 1.4 pM, 0.5 pM, and 6.1 pM, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>CAPS refers to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP-3 [nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold-Induced Autoinflammatory Syndrome-1 [<content styleCode="italics">CIAS1</content>]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected. Features common to all disorders include fever, urticaria-like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In most cases, inflammation in CAPS is associated with mutations in the NLRP-3 gene, which encodes the protein cryopyrin, an important component of the inflammasome. Cryopyrin regulates the protease caspase-1 and controls the activation of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Î²). Mutations in NLRP-3 result in an overactive inflammasome, resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1Î² that drives inflammation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DIRA is an autoinflammatory, autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss of function mutations in the <content styleCode="italics">IL1RN</content> gene, which encodes IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), resulting in unopposed signaling of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² through the IL-1 receptor.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a key cytokine that mediates the pathophysiology of many inflammatory processes, and it has been implicated as a causative factor in pericarditis. IL-1Î± and IL-1Î² bind to the universally expressed cell surface receptor, IL-1 Receptor type-1, triggering a cascade of inflammatory mediators. Pre-formed IL-1Î± is released by damaged/inflamed pericardial cells and may contribute to the maintenance and amplification of inflammation via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which then augments the inflammatory response by production of IL-1Î² in a cascade amplification system.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) are indicators of inflammatory disease activity that are elevated in patients with CAPS. Elevated SAA has been associated with the development of systemic amyloidosis in patients with CAPS.  Compared to placebo, treatment with ARCALYST resulted in sustained reductions from baseline in mean serum CRP and SAA to normal levels during the clinical trial. ARCALYST also normalized mean SAA from elevated levels.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>CRP is also an indicator of inflammation in DIRA. Maintenance of CRP reduction was observed in a clinical trial of pediatric patients with DIRA <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S14.2">Clinical Studies (14.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>CRP is also a recognized indicator of inflammation in pericarditis.  Treatment with rilonacept was observed in a clinical trial with RP to be associated with resolution of acute pericarditis episodes, including rapid and sustained reduction in CRP, with a median time to normalization of 7 days <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S14.3">Clinical Studies (14.3)</linkHtml>].</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The average trough levels of rilonacept were approximately 24 mcg/mL at steady state following weekly subcutaneous doses of 160 mg for up to 48 weeks in patients with CAPS. The steady state appeared to be reached by 6 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The average trough levels of rilonacept were approximately 23 mcg/mL at steady state, and the circulation half-life in vivo was approximately 7 days following a 320 mg loading dose and weekly subcutaneous doses of 160 mg for up to 36 weeks in patients with RP.  Steady state appeared to be reached by approximately 2 weeks. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No specific study was conducted to evaluate the effect of age, gender, or body weight on rilonacept exposure. Based on limited data obtained from the Phase 3 study RHAPSODY, steady state trough concentrations were similar between male and female patients. Age (26 to78 years) and body weight (50 to120 kg) did not appear to have a meaningful effect on trough rilonacept concentrations. The effect of race has not been assessed because of low numbers of non-Caucasian patients in the CAPS and RP programs, reflecting the epidemiology of these diseases.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pediatric patients with DIRA (3 to 6 years of age and body weight 12.7 to 19.9 kg) who received weekly subcutaneous doses of 4.4 mg/kg of ARCALYST, the average steady-state trough levels ranged from 63.5 to 74.0 mg/mL during the period of 6 to 24 months from the start of treatment with ARCALYST.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of ARCALYST for the treatment of CAPS was demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT00288704) with two parts (A and B) conducted sequentially in the same patients with FCAS and MWS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Part A was a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group period comparing ARCALYST at a dose of 160 mg weekly after an initial loading dose of 320 mg to placebo. Part B followed immediately after Part A and consisted of a 9-week, patient-blind period during which all patients received ARCALYST 160 mg weekly, followed by a 9-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal period in which patients were randomly assigned to either remain on ARCALYST 160 mg weekly or to receive placebo. Patients were then given the option to enroll in a 24-week, open-label treatment extension phase in which all patients were treated with ARCALYST 160 mg weekly.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Using a daily diary questionnaire, patients rated the following five signs and symptoms of CAPS: joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue, each on a scale of 0 (none, no severity) to 10 (very severe). The study evaluated the mean symptom score using the change from baseline to the end of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The changes in mean symptom scores for the randomized parallel-group period (Part A) and the randomized withdrawal period (Part B) of the study are shown in Table 2. ARCALYST-treated patients had a larger reduction in the mean symptom score in Part A compared to placebo-treated patients. In Part B, mean symptom scores increased more in patients withdrawn to placebo compared to patients who remained on ARCALYST.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of ARCALYST for the maintenance of remission of DIRA were demonstrated in a 2-year, open-label study (NCT01801449) of 6 pediatric patients who previously experienced clinical benefit from daily injections of an IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra. The study population included patients with a loss-of-function <content styleCode="italics">IL1RN</content> mutations. Patients had a median age at baseline of 4.8 years (range 3.3 to 6.2), and stopped anakinra treatment 24 hours before initiation of ARCALYST.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Remission was defined using the following criteria: diary score of &lt; 0.5 (reflecting no fever, skin rash and bone pain), acute phase reactants (&lt;0.5 mg/dL CRP), absence of objective skin rash, and no radiological evidence of active bone lesions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following an ARCALYST loading dose of 4.4 mg/kg subcutaneously, patients received a once-weekly maintenance dose of 2.2 mg/kg (up to a maximum 160 mg), and were assessed for remission and possible dose escalation. During the first 3 months of ARCALYST administration at the 2.2 mg/kg dose, five of 6 patients exhibited recurrence of pustular rash and therefore the dose was escalated to 4.4 mg/kg once weekly (up to a maximum of 320 mg). One patient remained on the 2.2 mg/kg once-weekly dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients met the primary endpoint of the study, remission at 6 months and sustained the remission for the remainder of the 2-year study. No patient required steroid use during the study.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of ARCALYST were evaluated in the Phase 3 study RHAPSODY (NCT03737110), a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, multinational study. The study consisted of a 12-week run-in followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal period.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the run-in period, adult patients received a loading dose of ARCALYST 320 mg followed by 160 mg weekly. Patients between 12 and 17 years of age received a loading dose of ARCALYST 4.4 mg/kg (up to 320 mg) followed by 2.2 mg/kg (up to 160 mg) weekly. During the run-in period, patients tapered and discontinued standard-of-care therapies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the withdrawal period, patients were randomized 1:1 to remain on ARCALYST 160 mg weekly or to receive placebo. The randomized withdrawal period continued until the pre-specified number of primary efficacy endpoint events (pericarditis recurrence) had accrued. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients recorded scores for pericarditis pain in a daily diary using the 0 to 10 NRS scale. Measurements of CRP, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms were conducted at intervals during study visits and to assess pericarditis recurrence</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients who experienced pericarditis recurrence were eligible for open-label ARCALYST (bailout). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 86 patients (mean age 45 years [range 13-78], 57% females) with symptomatic pericarditis recurrence were enrolled and received study treatment. Of these, 73 (85%) had a diagnosis of "idiopathic" pericarditis, and the remainder post-cardiac injury pericarditis. The mean duration of disease was 2.4 years with a mean of 4.4 pericarditis events per year including the qualifying pericarditis event (0-10 point Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] â¥ 4 and CRP â¥ 1 mg/dL). Mean qualifying NRS pain score was 6.2, and mean qualifying CRP level was 6.2 mg/dL.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the run-in period, daily NRS pain scores and CRP levels decreased as shown in Figure 2.</paragraph>

All patients were required to taper off standard-of-care pericarditis medications before randomization, and median time to rilonacept monotherapy was 7.9 weeks during the run-in period.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the 86 patients enrolled, 41 (48%) were on treatment with corticosteroids (CS) at baseline  (mean treatment duration of 20 weeks).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint was time to first adjudicated pericarditis recurrence (based on pain, CRP and clinical signs) in the event-driven withdrawal period. Of 61 patients randomized, 23 patients (74%) in the placebo arm had a recurrence compared with 2 patients (7%) in the rilonacept arm who temporarily discontinued treatment for 1 â 3 doses. The median time-to-recurrence on rilonacept could not be estimated because too few events occurred and was 8.6 weeks (95% CI 4.0, 11.7) on placebo with a hazard ratio of 0.04 (p &lt; 0.0001); rilonacept reduced the risk of recurrence by 96% (Figure 3).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The two recurrence events in the rilonacept group happened in association with temporary interruptions of the trial-drug regimen, of one to three weekly doses. In the placebo group, all 23 patients who had pericarditis recurrence received bailout rilonacept, with resolution of the episodes.</paragraph>
