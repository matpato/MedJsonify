                     <text>
                        <paragraph>For monotherapy and adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in patients 17 years of age and older and for adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older, an alternate initial dosing regimen for week 1 (e.g., including a loading dose and/or a higher initial dosage) may be administered in patients for whom achieving the recommended maintenance dosage in a shorter timeframe is clinically indicated (see Table 2). The alternate initial dosage regimen should be continued for one week. Lacosamide tablets may then be titrated based on clinical response and tolerability, no more frequently than once per week, if needed. The loading dose should be administered with medical supervision because of the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular adverse reactions
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</content>Titration increments should not exceed those shown in Table 2.

                     <title>5.1 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation</title>
                     <text>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including lacosamide, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication.  Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.  Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.  The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication.  The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lacosamide may cause dizziness and ataxia in adult and pediatric patients. In adult patients with partial-onset seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs, dizziness was experienced by 25% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of lacosamide (compared with 8% of placebo patients) and was the adverse reaction most frequently leading to discontinuation (3%). Ataxia was experienced by 6% of patients randomized to the recommended doses (200 to 400 mg/day) of lacosamide (compared to 2% of placebo patients). The onset of dizziness and ataxia was most commonly observed during titration.  There was a substantial increase in these adverse reactions at doses higher than 400 mg/day [

                        <paragraph>Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies in adult patients and in healthy volunteers [
 
  <content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   <linkHtml href="#Section_12.2">12.2</linkHtml>)
 
  </content>]. In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% (4/944) of patients randomized to receive lacosamide and 0% (0/364) of patients randomized to receive placebo. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg lacosamide. When lacosamide is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible.

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In the postmarketing setting, there have been reports of cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with lacosamide, including bradycardia, AV block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which have rarely resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Most, although not all, cases have occurred in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions, or in those taking concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction or prolong the PR interval. These events have occurred with both oral and intravenous routes of administration and at prescribed doses as well as in the setting of overdose [

 </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems (e.g., marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker), severe cardiac disease (such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease), and cardiac sodium channelopathies (e.g., Brugada Syndrome). Lacosamide should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [
 
  <content styleCode="italics">see Drug Interactions (

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the short-term investigational trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience.  In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with lacosamide experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Lacosamide administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or flutter), especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo.  In the short-term controlled trials in adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 1.2% of patients who were treated with lacosamide reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy.  Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day.  The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical partial-onset seizure studies in adult and pediatric patients.  These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including lacosamide. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening.  DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities,  myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection.       Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.  It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lacosamide should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions that occurred in this study were generally similar to those that occurred in adjunctive placebo-controlled studies. One adverse reaction, insomnia, occurred at a rate of ≥2% and was not reported at a similar rate in previous studies. This adverse reaction has also been observed in postmarketing experience [

                        <paragraph>In adjunctive therapy controlled clinical trials for partial-onset seizures, the rate of discontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 8% and 17% in patients randomized to receive lacosamide at the recommended doses of 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively, 29% at 600 mg/day (1.5 times greater than the maximum recommended dose), and 5% in patients randomized to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly (&gt;1% on lacosamide and greater than placebo) leading to discontinuation were dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, diplopia, nausea, vertigo, and blurred vision.</paragraph>

                           <br/>  In the adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled trial for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, adverse reactions that occurred in the study were generally similar to those that occurred in partial-onset seizure placebo-controlled studies. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10% on lacosamide) reported in patients treated with lacosamide were dizziness (23%), somnolence (17%), headache (14%), and nausea (10%), compared to 7%, 14%, 10%, and 6%, respectively, of patients who received placebo. Additionally, an adverse reaction not previously reported of myoclonic epilepsy was reported in 3% of patients treated with lacosamide compared to 1% of patients who received placebo. It is also noted that 2 patients receiving lacosamide had acute worsening of seizures shortly after drug initiation, including one episode of status epilepticus, compared to no patients receiving placebo.

Elevations of ALT to ≥3x ULN occurred in 0.7% (7/935) of lacosamide patients and 0% (0/356) of placebo patients. One case of hepatitis with transaminases &gt;20x ULN occurred in one healthy subject 10 days after lacosamide treatment completion, along with nephritis (proteinuria and urine casts). Serologic studies were negative for viral hepatitis. Transaminases returned to normal within one month without specific treatment. At the time of this event, bilirubin was normal. The hepatitis/nephritis was interpreted as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to lacosamide.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction (sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers) including those that prolong PR interval (including sodium channel blocking AEDs), because of a risk of AV block, bradycardia, or ventricular tachyarrhythmia.  In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning lacosamide, and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered lacosamide through the intravenous route [

                        <paragraph>Available data from the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry, a prospective cohort study, case reports, and a case series with lacosamide use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Lacosamide produced developmental toxicity (increased embryofetal and perinatal mortality, growth deficit) in rats following administration during pregnancy.  Developmental neurotoxicity was observed in rats following administration during a period of postnatal development corresponding to the third trimester of human pregnancy. These effects were observed at doses associated with clinically relevant plasma exposures

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oral administration of lacosamide to pregnant rats (20, 75, or 200 mg/kg/day) and rabbits (6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/kg/day) during the period of organogenesis did not produce any effects on the incidences of fetal structural abnormalities. However, the maximum doses evaluated were limited by maternal toxicity in both species and embryofetal death in rats. These doses were associated with maternal plasma lacosamide exposures (AUC) approximately 2 and 1 times (rat and rabbit, respectively) that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 400 mg/day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In two studies in which lacosamide (25, 70, or 200 mg/kg/day and 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation, increased perinatal mortality and decreased body weights in the offspring were observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect dose for pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats (70 mg/kg/day) was associated with a maternal plasma lacosamide AUC similar to that in humans at the MRHD.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of lacosamide (30, 90, or 180 mg/kg/day) to rats during the neonatal and juvenile periods of development resulted in decreased brain weights and long-term neurobehavioral changes (altered open field performance, deficits in learning and memory). The early postnatal period in rats is generally thought to correspond to late pregnancy in humans in terms of brain development. The no-effect dose for developmental neurotoxicity in rats was associated with a plasma lacosamide AUC less than that in humans at the MRHD.</paragraph>

In a human abuse potential study, single doses of 200 mg (equal to the maximum single dosage) and 800 mg lacosamide (equal to twice the recommended daily maintenance dosage) produced euphoria-type subjective responses that differentiated statistically from placebo; at 800 mg, these euphoria-type responses were statistically indistinguishable from those produced by alprazolam, a Schedule IV drug. The duration of the euphoria-type responses following lacosamide was less than that following alprazolam. A high rate of euphoria was also reported as an adverse event in the human abuse potential study following single doses of 800 mg lacosamide (15% [5/34]) compared to placebo (0%) and in two pharmacokinetic studies following single and multiple doses of 300 to 800 mg lacosamide (ranging from 6% [2/33] to 25% [3/12]) compared to placebo (0%). However, the rate of euphoria reported as an adverse event in the lacosamide development program at therapeutic doses was less than 1%.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the 3 efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Lacosamide exposure is correlated with the reduction in seizure frequency. However, doses above 400 mg/day do not appear to confer additional benefit in group analyses. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Electrocardiographic effects of lacosamide were determined in a double-blind, randomized clinical pharmacology trial of 247 healthy subjects. Chronic oral doses of 400 and 800 mg/day (equal to and two times the maximum daily recommended dose, respectively) were compared with placebo and a positive control (400 mg moxifloxacin). Lacosamide did not prolong QTc interval and did not have a dose-related or clinically important effect on QRS duration. Lacosamide produced a small, dose-related increase in mean PR interval. At steady-state, the time of the maximum observed mean PR interval corresponded with t
 
  <sub>max</sub>. The placebo-subtracted maximum increase in PR interval (at t
 
  <sub>max</sub>) was 7.3 ms for the 400 mg/day group and 11.9 ms for the 800 mg/day group. For patients who participated in the controlled trials, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum increase in PR interval for a 400 mg/day lacosamide dose was 3.1 ms in patients with partial-onset seizures and 9.4 ms for patients with diabetic neuropathy.

                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide have been studied in healthy adult subjects (age range 18 to 87), adults with partial-onset seizures, adults with diabetic neuropathy, and subjects with renal and hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are similar in healthy subjects, patients with partial-onset seizures, and patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect with a high absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. The maximum lacosamide plasma concentrations occur approximately 1-to-4-hour post-dose after oral dosing, and elimination half-life is approximately 13 hours. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 3 days of twice daily repeated administration. Pharmacokinetics of lacosamide are dose proportional (100 to 800 mg) and time invariant, with low inter- and intra-subject variability. Compared to lacosamide the major metabolite, O-desmethyl metabolite, has a longer T
 
  <sub>max</sub>(0.5 to 12 hours) and elimination half-life (15 to 23 hours).

                        <paragraph>Lacosamide is completely absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of lacosamide tablets is approximately 100%. Food does not affect the rate and extent of absorption.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>After intravenous administration, C
 
  <sub>max </sub>is reached at the end of infusion. The 30- and 60-minute intravenous infusions are bioequivalent to the oral tablet. For the 15-minute intravenous infusion, bioequivalence was met for AUC
 
  <sub>(0-tz)</sub>but not for C
 
  <sub>max</sub>. The point estimate of C
 
  <sub>max </sub>was 20% higher than C
 
  <sub>max </sub>for oral tablet and the 90% CI for C
 
  <sub>max </sub>exceeded the upper boundary of the bioequivalence range.

                        <paragraph>After oral and intravenous administration of 100 mg [14C]-lacosamide approximately 95% of radioactivity administered was recovered in the urine and less than 0.5% in the feces. The major compounds excreted were unchanged lacosamide (approximately 40% of the dose), its O-desmethyl metabolite (approximately 30%), and a structurally unknown polar fraction (~20%). The plasma exposure of the major human metabolite, O­ desmethyl-lacosamide, is approximately 10% of that of lacosamide. This metabolite has no known pharmacological activity.</paragraph>

The elimination half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13 hours and is not altered by different doses, multiple dosing or intravenous administration.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>There is no enantiomeric interconversion of lacosamide.

                     <title>14.1 Monotherapy in Patients with Partial-Onset Seizures</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of lacosamide in monotherapy was established in a historical-control, multicenter, randomized trial that included 425 patients, age 16 to 70 years, with partial-onset seizures (Study 1). To be included in Study 1, patients were required to be taking stable doses of 1 or 2 marketed antiepileptic drugs. This treatment continued into the 8 week baseline period. To remain in the study, patients were required to have at least 2 partial-onset seizures per 28 days during the 8 week baseline period. The baseline period was followed by a 3 week titration period, during which lacosamide was added to the ongoing antiepileptic regimen. This was followed by a 16­ week maintenance period (i.e., a 6-week withdrawal period for background antiepileptic drugs, followed by a 10-week monotherapy period). Patients were randomized 3 to 1 to receive lacosamide 400 mg/day or lacosamide 300 mg/day. Treatment assignments were blinded. Response to treatment was based upon a comparison of the number of patients who met exit criteria during the maintenance phase, compared to historical controls. The historical control consisted of a pooled analysis of the control groups from 8 studies of similar design, which utilized a sub-therapeutic dose of an antiepileptic drug. Statistical superiority to the historical control was considered to be demonstrated if the upper limit from a 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the percentage of patients meeting exit criteria in patients receiving lacosamide remained below the lower 95% prediction limit of 65% derived from the historical control data.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The exit criteria were one or more of the following: (1) doubling of average monthly seizure frequency during any 28 consecutive days, (2) doubling of highest consecutive 2-day seizure frequency, (3) occurrence of a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure, (4) clinically significant prolongation or worsening of overall seizure duration, frequency, type or pattern considered by the investigator to require trial discontinuation, (5) status epilepticus or new onset of serial/cluster seizures. The study population profile appeared comparable to that of the historical control population.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>For the lacosamide 400 mg/day group, the estimate of the percentage of patients meeting at least 1 exit criterion was 30% (95% CI: 25%, 36%). The upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI (36%) was below the threshold of 65% derived from the historical control data, meeting the pre-specified criteria for efficacy. Lacosamide 300 mg/day also met the pre-specified criteria for efficacy.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.2 Adjunctive Therapy in Patients with Partial-Onset Seizures</title>
                     <text>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures was established in three 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials in adult patients (Study 2, Study 3, and Study 4). Enrolled patients had partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization, and were not adequately controlled with 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs. During an 8-week baseline period, patients were required to have an average of ≥4 partial-onset seizures per 28 days with no seizure-free period exceeding 21 days. In these 3 trials, patients had a mean duration of epilepsy of 24 years and a median baseline seizure frequency ranging from 10 to 17 per 28 days. 84% of patients were taking 2 to 3 concomitant AEDs with or without concurrent vagal nerve stimulation.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Study 2 compared doses of lacosamide 200, 400, and 600 mg/day with placebo. Study 3 compared doses of lacosamide 400 and 600 mg/day with placebo. Study 4 compared doses of lacosamide 200 and 400 mg/day with placebo. In all three trials, following an 8-week baseline phase to establish baseline seizure frequency prior to randomization, patients were randomized and titrated to the randomized dose (a 1-step back-titration of lacosamide 100 mg/day or placebo was allowed in the case of intolerable adverse reactions at the end of the titration phase). During the titration phase, in all 3 adjunctive therapy trials, treatment was initiated at 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily) and increased in weekly increments of 100 mg/day to the target dose. The titration phase lasted 6 weeks in Study 2 and Study 3, and 4 weeks in Study 4. In all three trials, the titration phase was followed by a maintenance phase that lasted 12 weeks, during which patients were to remain on a stable dose of lacosamide.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>A reduction in 28-day seizure frequency (baseline to maintenance phase), as compared to the placebo group, was the primary variable in all three adjunctive therapy trials. A statistically significant effect was observed with lacosamide treatment (Figure 1) at doses of 200 mg/day (Study 4), 400 mg/day (Studies 2, 3, and 4), and 600 mg/day (Studies 2 and 3).</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Subset evaluations of lacosamide demonstrate no important differences in seizure control as a function of gender or race, although data on race was limited (about 10% of patients were non-Caucasian).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM2"/> 

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Figure 2 presents the percentage of patients (X-axis) with a percent reduction in partial seizure frequency (responder rate) from baseline to the maintenance phase at least as great as that represented on the Y-axis. A positive value on the Y-axis indicates an improvement from baseline (i.e., a decrease in seizure frequency), while a negative value indicates a worsening from baseline (i.e., an increase in seizure frequency). Thus, in a display of this type, a curve for an effective treatment is shifted to the left of the curve for placebo. The proportion of patients achieving any particular level of reduction in seizure frequency was consistently higher for the lacosamide groups, compared to the placebo group.  For example, 40% of patients randomized to lacosamide (400 mg/day) experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, compared to 23% of patients randomized to placebo. Patients with an increase in seizure frequency &gt;100% are represented on the Y- axis as equal to or greater than -100%.

                     <title>14.3 Adjunctive Therapy in Patients with Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in patients 4 years of age and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy experiencing primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures was established in a 24-week doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study (Study 5). The study consisted of a 12-week historical baseline period, a 4-week prospective baseline period, and a 24-week treatment period (which included a 6-week titration period and an 18-week maintenance period). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 3 antiepileptic drugs experiencing at least 3 documented PGTC seizures during the 16-week combined baseline period were randomized 1:1 to receive lacosamide (n=121) or placebo (n=121). 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  Patients were dosed on a fixed-dose regimen. Dosing was initiated at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in patients weighing less than 50 kg or 100 mg/day in patients weighing 50 kg or more in 2 divided doses. During the titration period, lacosamide doses were adjusted in 2 mg/kg/day increments in patients weighing less than 50 kg or 100 mg/day in patients weighing 50 kg or more at weekly intervals to achieve the target maintenance period dose of 12 mg/kg/day in patients weighing less than 30 kg, 8 mg/kg/day in patients weighing from 30 to less than 50 kg, or 400 mg/day in patients weighing 50 kg or more. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  The primary efficacy endpoint (patients in the modified full analysis set: lacosamide n=118, placebo n=121) was the time to second PGTC seizure during the 24-week treatment period (Figure 3). The risk of developing a second PGTC seizure was statistically significantly lower in lacosamide group than in the placebo group during the 24-week treatment period (hazard ratio=0.548, 95% CI of hazard ratio: 0.381, 0.788, p-value = 0.001), with the corresponding risk reduction being 45.2%. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients not experiencing a PGTC seizure during the 24-week treatment period. The adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates of 24-week freedom from PGTC seizures were 31.3% in lacosamide group and 17.2% in placebo group. The adjusted difference between treatment groups was 14.1% (95% CI: 3.2, 25.1, p-value=0.011).
