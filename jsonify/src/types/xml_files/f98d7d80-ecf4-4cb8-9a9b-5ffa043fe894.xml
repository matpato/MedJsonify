                        <paragraph ID="ID15">Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets are also indicated for the treatment of symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in females of reproductive potential who choose to use an oral contraceptive as their method of contraception. The effectiveness of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets for PMDD when used for more than three menstrual cycles has not been evaluated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The essential features of PMDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-4th edition (DSM-IV) include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. In this disorder, these symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Diagnosis is made by healthcare providers according to DSM-IV criteria, with symptomatology assessed prospectively over at least two menstrual cycles. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets has not been evaluated for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).</paragraph>

(The first day of menstruation is Day 1.) She should take one pink drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablet daily for 24 consecutive days, followed by one light orange tablet daily on Days 25 through 28. Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets should be taken in the order directed on the package at the same time each day, preferably after the evening meal or at bedtime with some liquid, as needed. Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets can be taken without regard to meals. If drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablet and levomefolate calcium tablet is first taken later than the first day of the menstrual cycle, drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets should not be considered effective as a contraceptive until after the first 7 consecutive days of product administration. Instruct the patient to use a non-hormonal contraceptive as back-up during the first 7 days. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.</paragraph>

She should begin taking her pink tablets on the next day after ingestion of the last light orange folate tablet, regardless of whether or not a menstrual period has occurred or is still in progress. Anytime a subsequent cycle of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets is started later than the day following administration of the last light orange tablet, the patient should use another method of contraception until she has taken a pink drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablet daily for seven consecutive days.</paragraph>

When switching from an intrauterine contraceptive or an implant, drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets should be started on the day of removal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within 3 days following the last pink tablet. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs while taking drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets instruct the patient to continue taking drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets by the regimen described above. Counsel her that this type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, advise her that if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, she should consult her healthcare provider.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although the occurrence of pregnancy is low if drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets are taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets if pregnancy is confirmed.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of pregnancy increases with each active pink tablet missed. If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence. If the patient misses one or more light orange tablets, she should still be protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking a new cycle of pink tablets on the proper day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For postpartum women who do not breastfeed or after a second trimester abortion, start drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets no earlier than 4 weeks postpartum due to the increased risk of thromboembolism. If the patient starts on drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets postpartum and has not yet had a period, evaluate for possible pregnancy, and instruct her to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets for 7 consecutive days.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on presently available information on DRSP-containing COCs with 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol (that is, Yasmin<sup>®</sup>), DRSP-containing COCs may be associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than COCs containing the progestin levonorgestrel or some other progestins. Epidemiologic studies that compared the risk of VTE reported that the risk ranged from no increase to a three-fold increase. Before initiating use of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets in a new COC user or a woman who is switching from a contraceptive that does not contain DRSP, consider the risks and benefits of a DRSP-containing COC in light of her risk of a VTE. Known risk factors for VTE include smoking, obesity, and family history of VTE, in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID37">4</linkHtml>)].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A number of studies have compared the risk of VTE for users of Yasmin<sup>®</sup> (which contains 0.03 mg of EE and 3 mg of DRSP) to the risk for users of other COCs, including COCs containing levonorgestrel.

                        <paragraph ID="ID48">In addition to these "regulatory studies," other studies of various designs have been conducted. Overall, there are two prospective cohort studies (see Table 2): the US post-approval safety study Ingenix [Seeger 2007], the European post-approval safety study EURAS (European Active Surveillance Study) [Dinger 2007]. An extension of the EURAS study, the Long-Term Active Surveillance Study (LASS), did not enroll additional subjects, but continued to assess VTE risk. There are three retrospective cohort studies: one study in the US funded by the FDA (see Table 2), and two from Denmark [Lidegaard 2009, Lidegaard 2011]. There are two case-control studies: the Dutch MEGA study analysis [van Hylckama Vlieg 2009] and the German case-control study [Dinger 2010]. There are two nested case-control studies that evaluated the risk of non-fatal idiopathic VTE: the PharMetrics study [Jick 2011] and the GPRD study [Parkin 2011]. The results of all of these studies are presented in Figure 1.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Although the absolute VTE rates are increased for users of hormonal contraceptives compared to non-users, the rates during pregnancy are even greater, especially during the post-partum period (see Figure 2). The risk of VTE in women using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 per 10,000 woman-years. The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use. Data from a large, prospective cohort safety study of various COCs suggest that this increased risk, as compared to that in non-COC users, is greatest during the first 6 months of COC use. Data from this safety study indicate that the greatest risk of VTE is present after initially starting a COC or restarting (following a 4 week or greater pill-free interval) the same or a different COC.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID54">Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets contains 3 mg of the progestin DRSP, which has anti-mineralocorticoid activity, including the potential for hyperkalemia in high-risk patients, comparable to a 25 mg dose of spironolactone. Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets are contraindicated in patients with conditions that predispose to hyperkalemia (that is, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and adrenal insufficiency).Women receiving daily, long-term treatment for chronic conditions or diseases with medications that may increase serum potassium concentration should have their serum potassium concentration checked during the first treatment cycle. Medications that may increase serum potassium concentration include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplementation, heparin, aldosterone antagonists, and NSAIDs. Consider monitoring serum potassium concentration in high-risk patients who take a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor long-term and concomitantly. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), HIV/HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, boceprevir), and clarithromycin <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID140">12.3</linkHtml>)].</content>

Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) and breast cancer risk. Studies do not show an association between ever (current or past) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer. However, some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users (&lt;6 months since last use) and current users with longer duration of COC use [<content styleCode="italics">see Adverse Reactions</content> (<linkHtml href="#ID91">6.2</linkHtml>)]<br/>

Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia. However, there is controversy about the extent to which these findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors<br/>

                        <paragraph ID="ID70">Unscheduled (breakthrough or intracyclic) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs, especially during the first three months of use. If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data for drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets show the average number of episodes of bleeding per reference period (90 days) was 3.2 in Cycles 4 to 6. The average number of bleeding and/or spotting days with drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets was 15.1 days. The intensity of bleeding for drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets based on the ratio of spotting-only days versus total bleeding and/or spotting days was 5.2/15.1 days.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Based on patient diaries from two contraceptive clinical trials of YAZ<sup>®</sup>, 8 to 25% of women experienced unscheduled bleeding per 28-day cycle. A total of 12 subjects out of 1,056 (1.1%) discontinued YAZ<sup>®</sup> due to menstrual disorders including intermenstrual bleeding, menorrhagia, and metrorrhagia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Women who use drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets may experience absence of withdrawal bleeding, even if they are not pregnant. Based on subject diaries from YAZ<sup>®</sup> contraception trials for up to 13 cycles, 6 to 10% of women experienced cycles with no withdrawal bleeding. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If withdrawal bleeding does not occur, consider the possibility of pregnancy. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule (missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>For contraception, a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, open-label study was conducted to evaluate safety and efficacy up to one year in 1,027 women aged 17 to 36 who took at least one dose of YAZ<sup>®</sup>. A second Phase 3 study was a single center, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate the effect of 7 28-day cycles of YAZ<sup>®</sup> on carbohydrate metabolism, lipids and hemostasis in 29 women aged 18 to 35. For acne, two multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, in 536 women aged 14 to 45 with moderate acne vulgaris who took at least one dose of YAZ<sup>®</sup>, evaluated the safety and efficacy during up to 6 cycles. For folate supplementation, the primary efficacy study using drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled US trial in 379 healthy women aged 18 to 40 who were treated with drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets or YAZ<sup>®</sup> for up to 24 weeks.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DRSP is present in human milk. After a single oral administration of 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE tablets, DRSP concentration in breast milk over the 24-h period ranged from 1.4 to 7.0 ng/mL, with a mean ± standard deviation value of 3.7 ± 1.9 ng/mL. The estimated mean infant dose was 0.003 mg/day, which is about 0.1% of maternal dose (see Data). There is limited information on the effects of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets on the breast-fed infant. CHCs can reduce milk production in breast- feeding females. This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast-feeding is well-established. When possible, advise the nursing female to use other methods of contraception until she discontinues breast-feeding. [See also Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Increase in folate concentration in milk is not expected (see Data).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets  or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>An open-label study evaluated the degree of DRSP transfer into milk within 72 hours following a single oral administration of 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE tablets to 6 healthy lactating women who were 1 week to 3 months post-partum. DRSP was present in breast milk with a mean Cmax of 13.5 ng/mL, while the mean Cmax in serum of lactating women was 30.8 ng/mL. The DRSP concentration in breast milk over the 24-hour period following dosing ranged from 1.4 to 7.0 ng/mL, with a mean ± standard deviation value of 3.7 ± 1.9 ng/mL. Based on single dose data, the maximal daily infant dose of DRSP was calculated to be 0.003 mg/day, which represented a mean of 0.1% of the maternal dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A study in approximately 60 lactating women demonstrated no significant differences in folate concentrations in milk between women who received 416mcg/day [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate or 400 mcg/day folic acid and women who received placebo over a 16 week period. Studies to date indicate there is no adverse effect of folate on nursing infants.</paragraph>

More than 90% of subjects in these studies demonstrated ovulation inhibition. One study compared the effect of 3 mg DRSP/0.02 mg EE combinations with two different regimens (24-day active tablet period plus 4-day pill-free period vs. 21-day active tablet period plus 7-day pill-free period) on the suppression of ovarian activity during two treatment cycles. During the first treatment cycle, there were no subjects (0/49, 0%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 1 subject (1/50, 2%) using the 21-day regimen. After intentionally introduced dosing errors (3 missed active tablets on Days 1 to 3) during the second treatment cycle, there was 1 subject (1/49, 2%) taking the 24-day regimen who ovulated compared to 4 subjects (4/50, 8%) using the 21-day regimen.</paragraph>

The pharmacodynamic effect on plasma folate, RBC folate, and the profile of circulating folate metabolites was assessed during 24 weeks of treatment with 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium or with 0.4 mg folic acid (equimolar dose to 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium), both in combination with 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE (Yasmin<sup>®</sup>) followed by 20 weeks of open-label treatment with Yasmin<sup>®</sup> only (elimination phase). <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#ID155">14.4</linkHtml>).]</content>

                        <paragraph>Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets and YAZ<sup>®</sup> are bioequivalent with respect to DRSP and EE.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The absolute bioavailability of DRSP from a single entity tablet is about 76%. The absolute bioavailability of EE is approximately 40% as a result of presystemic conjugation and first-pass metabolism. The absolute bioavailability of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets, which is combination tablets of DRSP and EE has not been evaluated. Serum concentrations of DRSP and EE reached peak levels within 1 to 2 hours after administration of drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of DRSP are dose proportional following single doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg. Following daily dosing of YAZ<sup>®</sup>, steady state DRSP concentrations were observed after 8 days. There was about 2 to 3 fold accumulation in serum C<sub>max</sub> and AUC (0 to 24h) values of DRSP following multiple dose administration of YAZ<sup>®</sup> (see Table 3).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For EE, steady-state conditions are reported during the second half of a treatment cycle. Following daily administration of YAZ<sup>®</sup>, serum C<sub>max</sub> and AUC (0 to 24h) values of EE accumulate by a factor of about 1.5 to 2 (see Table 3).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Levomefolate calcium is structurally identical to L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-methyl-THF), a metabolite of vitamin B<sub>9</sub>. Mean baseline concentrations of about 15 nmol/L are reached in populations without folate food fortification under normal nutritional conditions. Orally administered levomefolate calcium is absorbed and incorporated into the body folate pool. Peak plasma concentrations of about 50 nmol/L above baseline are reached within 0.5 to 1.5 hours after single oral administration of 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Steady state conditions for total folate in plasma after intake of 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium are reached after about 8 to 16 weeks depending on the baseline levels. In red blood cells achievement of steady state is delayed due to the long life-span of red blood cells of about 120 days.</paragraph>

The extent of absorption of DRSP, however, remained unchanged. In contrast, the extent of absorption of EE was reduced by about 20% under fed conditions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DRSP and EE serum concentrations decline in two phases. The apparent volume of distribution of DRSP is approximately 4 L/kg and that of EE is reported to be approximately 4 to 5 L/kg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>DRSP does not bind to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) or corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) but binds about 97% to other serum proteins. Multiple dosing over 3 cycles resulted in no change in the free fraction (as measured at trough concentrations). EE is reported to be highly but non-specifically bound to serum albumin (approximately 98.5 %) and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of both SHBG and CBG. EE induced effects on SHBG and CBG were not affected by variation of the DRSP dosage in the range of 2 to 3 mg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Biphasic kinetics is reported for folates with a fast- and a slow-turnover pool. The fast turnover pool, probably reflecting newly absorbed folate, is consistent with the terminal half-life of approximately 4 to 5 hours after single oral administration of 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium. The slow-turnover pool reflecting turnover of folate polyglutamate has a mean residence time of greater than or equal to 100 days.</paragraph>

Drospirenone is also subject to oxidative metabolism catalyzed by CYP3A4.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>EE has been reported to be subject to significant gut and hepatic first-pass metabolism. Metabolism of EE and its oxidative metabolites occur primarily by conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. CYP3A4 in the liver is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation which is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>DRSP serum concentrations are characterized by a terminal disposition phase half-life of approximately 30 hours after both single and multiple dose regimens. Excretion of DRSP was nearly complete after ten days and amounts excreted were slightly higher in feces compared to urine. DRSP was extensively metabolized and only trace amounts of unchanged DRSP were excreted in urine and feces. At least 20 different metabolites were observed in urine and feces. About 38 to 47% of the metabolites in urine were glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In feces, about 17 to 20% of the metabolites were excreted as glucuronides and sulfates.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For EE the terminal disposition phase half-life has been reported to be approximately 24 hours. EE is not excreted unchanged. EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates and undergoes enterohepatic circulation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>L-5-methyl-THF is eliminated from the body by urinary excretion of intact folates and catabolic products as well as fecal excretion through a biphasic kinetics process.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of DRSP (3 mg daily for 14 days) and the effect of DRSP on serum potassium concentrations were investigated in three separate groups of female subjects (n=28, age 30 to 65). All subjects were on a low potassium diet. During the study, 7 subjects continued the use of potassium-sparing drugs for the treatment of their underlying illness. On the 14th day (steady-state) of DRSP treatment, the serum DRSP concentrations in the group with CLcr of 50 to 79 mL/min were comparable to those in the control group with CLcr ≥ 80 mL/min. The serum DRSP concentrations were on average 37% higher in the group with CLcr of 30 to 49 mL/min compared to those in the control group. DRSP treatment did not show any clinically significant effect on serum potassium concentration. Although hyperkalemia was not observed in the study, in five of the seven subjects who continued use of potassium-sparing drugs during the study, mean serum potassium concentrations increased by up to 0.33 mEq/L. <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID37">4</linkHtml>) and Warnings And Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID53">5.2</linkHtml>).]</content>

Metabolism of DRSP and potential effects of DRSP on hepatic CYP enzymes have been investigated in <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> studies. In <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> studies DRSP did not affect turnover of model substrates of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, but had an inhibitory influence on the turnover of model substrates of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4, with CYP2C19 being the most sensitive enzyme. The potential effect of DRSP on CYP2C19 activity was investigated in a clinical pharmacokinetic study using omeprazole as a marker substrate. In the study with 24 postmenopausal women [including 12 women with homozygous (wild type) CYP2C19 genotype and 12 women with heterozygous CYP2C19 genotype] the daily oral administration of 3 mg DRSP for 14 days did not affect the oral clearance of omeprazole (40 mg, single oral dose) and the CYP2C19 product 5-hydroxy omeprazole. Furthermore, no significant effect of DRSP on the systemic clearance of the CYP3A4 product omeprazole sulfone was found.

Women aged 18 to 42 who met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD, confirmed by prospective daily ratings of their symptoms, were enrolled. Both studies measured the treatment effect of YAZ<sup>®</sup> using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems scale, a patient-rated instrument that assesses the symptoms that constitute the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. The primary study was a parallel group design that included 384 evaluable reproductive-aged women with PMDD who were randomly assigned to receive YAZ<sup>®</sup> or placebo treatment for 3 menstrual cycles. The supportive study, a crossover design, was terminated prematurely prior to achieving recruitment goals due to enrollment difficulties. A total of 64 women of reproductive age with PMDD were treated initially with YAZ<sup>®</sup> or placebo for up to 3 cycles followed by a washout cycle and then crossed over to the alternate medication for 3 cycles.</paragraph>

In both trials, women who received YAZ<sup>®</sup> had statistically significantly greater improvement in their Daily Record of Severity of Problems scores. In the primary study, the average decrease (improvement) from baseline was 37.5 points in women taking YAZ<sup>®</sup>, compared to 30.0 points in women taking placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID156">The development program for drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets consisted of two clinical trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>One study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group US study. Plasma folate and red blood cell folate levels were investigated during a 24-week treatment with YAZ<sup>®</sup> + 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium as compared to YAZ<sup>®</sup> alone in a U.S. population with folate fortified food. A total of 379 healthy women between 18 and 40 years of age with no restrictions on folate supplementation received YAZ<sup>®</sup> + levomefolate calcium (N= 285) or YAZ<sup>®</sup> (N=94). The plasma and RBC folate concentrations at Week 24 were the co-primary endpoints. Figures 4 and 5 display the results for plasma and RBC folate, respectively, among evaluable subjects in each arm of the study.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the second study, the pharmacodynamic effect on plasma folate, RBC folate, and the profile of circulating folate metabolites was assessed during 24 weeks of treatment with 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium or with 0.4 mg folic acid (equimolar dose to 0.451 mg levomefolate calcium), both in combination with 3 mg DRSP/0.03 mg EE (Yasmin<sup>®</sup>) followed by 20 weeks of open-label treatment with Yasmin<sup>®</sup> only (elimination phase). One-hundred and seventy-two healthy women between 18 to 40 years of age from a German population without folate food fortification and without concomitant intake of folate supplements were randomized to one of the two treatments.

                        <paragraph>The potential to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) with folate supplementation is well established based on a body of evidence derived from randomized, controlled trials, nonrandomized intervention trials, and observational studies using folic acid. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend that women of childbearing age consume supplemental folic acid in a dose of at least 0.4 mg (400 mcg) daily <sup>1,6</sup>.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets are a birth control pill. It contains two female hormones, a synthetic estrogen called ethinyl estradiol and a progestin called drospirenone. Drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets also contains levomefolate calcium, which is a B vitamin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The progestin drospirenone may increase potassium. Therefore, you should not take drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets if you have kidney, liver or adrenal disease because this could cause serious heart and health problems. Other drugs may also increase potassium. If you are currently on daily, long-term treatment for a chronic condition with any of the medications below, you should consult your healthcare provider about whether drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets are right for you, and during the first month that you take drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets, you should have a blood test to check your potassium level.</paragraph>

PMDD is a mood disorder related to the menstrual cycle. PMDD significantly interferes with work or school, or with usual social activities and relationships with others. Symptoms include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, mood swings, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD may include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly before menstruation starts and go away within a few days following the start of the period. Diagnosis of PMDD should be made by healthcare providers.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Like pregnancy, birth control pills increase the risk of serious blood clots (see following graph), especially in women who have other risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, or age greater than 35. This increased risk is highest when you first start taking birth control pills and when you restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more. Women who use birth control pills with drospirenone (like drospirenone, ethinyl estradiol and levomefolate calcium tablets and levomefolate calcium tablets) may have a higher risk of getting a blood clot. Some studies reported that the risk of blood clots was higher for women who use birth control pills that contain drospirenone than for women who use birth control pills that do not contain drospirenone.</paragraph>

Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.</paragraph>
