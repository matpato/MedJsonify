When a 400 mg dose is needed (given as two subcutaneous injections of 200 mg), injections should occur at separate sites in the thigh or abdomen.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The solution should be carefully inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The solution should be a clear to opalescent, colorless to yellow liquid, essentially free from particulates and should not be used if cloudy or if foreign particulate matter is present.  CIMZIA does not contain preservatives; therefore, unused portions of drug remaining in the syringe or vial should be discarded.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients treated with CIMZIA are at an increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, parasitic, or other opportunistic pathogens including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with CIMZIA should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including clinically important localized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions, and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants (e.g. corticosteroids or methotrexate) may be at a greater risk of infection. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients:</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Cases of reactivation of tuberculosis or new tuberculosis infections have been observed in patients receiving CIMZIA, including patients who have previously or concomitantly received treatment for latent or active tuberculosis. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extrapulmonary (i.e., disseminated) tuberculosis. Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating CIMZIA and periodically during therapy.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF-blocking agents has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy.  Prior to initiating CIMZIA, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; and consider an induration of 5 mm or greater a positive tuberculin skin test result, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of CIMZIA in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection.  Despite previous or concomitant treatment for latent tuberculosis, cases of active tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with CIMZIA. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have redeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with CIMZIA. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision of whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Strongly consider tuberculosis in patients who develop a new infection during CIMZIA treatment, especially in patients who have previously or recently traveled to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, or who have had close contact with a person with active tuberculosis.</paragraph>

Tests for latent tuberculosis infection may also be falsely negative while on therapy with CIMZIA.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>CIMZIA should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with CIMZIA should be closely monitored, undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>For patients who reside or travel in regions where mycoses are endemic, invasive fungal infection should be suspected if they develop a serious systemic illness. Appropriate empiric antifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed. Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection. When feasible, the decision to administer empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made in consultation with a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections and should take into account both the risk for severe fungal infection and risks of antifungal therapy.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.2 Malignancies</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In the controlled portions of clinical studies of some TNF blockers, more cases of malignancies have been observed among patients receiving TNF blockers compared to control patients. During controlled and open-labeled portions of CIMZIA studies of Crohn's disease and other diseases, malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed at a rate (95% confidence interval) of 0.5 (0.4, 0.7) per 100 patient-years among 4,650 CIMZIA-treated patients versus a rate of 0.6 (0.1, 1.7) per 100 patient-years among 1,319 placebo-treated patients. During CIMZIA studies of psoriasis, malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed corresponding to an incidence rate of 0.5 (0.2, 1.0) per 100 subject-years among a total of 995 subjects who received CIMZIA. The size of the control group and limited duration of the controlled portions of the studies precludes the ability to draw firm conclusions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy â¤ 18 years of age), of which CIMZIA is a member. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with immunosuppression and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months of therapy (range 1 to 84 months). Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. These cases were reported post-marketing and are derived from a variety of sources including registries and spontaneous post-marketing reports. CIMZIA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of all the TNF blockers, more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving TNF blockers compared to control patients. In controlled studies of CIMZIA for Crohn's disease and other investigational uses, there was one case of lymphoma among 2,657 Cimzia-treated patients and one case of Hodgkin's lymphoma among 1,319 placebo-treated patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the CIMZIA RA clinical trials (placebo-controlled and open-label) a total of three cases of lymphoma were observed among 2,367 patients. This is approximately 2-fold higher than expected in the general population. Patients with RA, particularly those with highly active disease, are at a higher risk for the development of lymphoma. In the CIMZIA PsO clinical trials (placebo-controlled and open-label) there was one case of Hodgkin's lymphoma.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Rates in clinical studies for CIMZIA cannot be compared to the rates of clinical trials of other TNF blockers and may not predict the rates observed when CIMZIA is used in a broader patient population. Patients with Crohn's disease that require chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies may be at higher risk than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF blocker therapy <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>. The potential role of TNF blocker therapy in the development of malignancies in adults is not known.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), a rare type of T-cell lymphoma that has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal, have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including CIMZIA.  The majority of reported TNF blocker cases occurred in adolescent and young adult males with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.  Almost all of these patients had received  treatment with the immunosuppressants azathioprine and/or 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) concomitantly with a TNF blocker at or prior to diagnosis.  It is uncertain whether the occurrence of HSTCL is related to use of a TNF blocker or a TNF blocker in combination with these other immunosuppressants.  The potential risk of using a TNF blocker in combination with azathioprine or 6-MP should be carefully considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported in association with post-marketing TNF-blocker use in RA and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with RA may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF blockers, including CIMZIA. Periodic skin examinations are recommended for all patients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF blockers, including CIMZIA. CIMZIA has not been formally studied in patients with CHF; however, in clinical studies in patients with CHF with another TNF blocker, worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and increased mortality due to CHF were observed.

Some of these reactions occurred after the first administration of CIMZIA. If such reactions occur, discontinue further administration of CIMZIA and institute appropriate therapy. There are no data on the risks of using CIMZIA in patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction towards another TNF blocker; in these patients caution is needed <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6.1">Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Use of TNF blockers, including CIMZIA, has been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic carriers of this virus. In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of reports have occurred in patients concomitantly receiving other medications that suppress the immune system, which may also contribute to HBV reactivation. 								</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Test patients for HBV infection before initiating treatment with CIMZIA. For patients who test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended. Adequate data are not available on the safety or efficacy of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with TNF blocker therapy to prevent HBV reactivation. Patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with CIMZIA should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. 								</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients who develop HBV reactivation, discontinue CIMZIA and initiate effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment. The safety of resuming TNF blocker therapy after HBV reactivation is controlled is not known. Therefore, exercise caution when considering resumption of CIMZIA therapy in this situation and monitor patients closely. 								</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra (an interleukin-1 antagonist) and another TNF blocker, etanercept, with no added benefit compared to etanercept alone.  A higher risk of serious infections was also observed in combination use of TNF blockers with abatacept and rituximab. Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with this combination therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the use of CIMZIA in this combination. Therefore, the use of CIMZIA in combination with other biological DMARDs is not recommended <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S7.1">Drug Interactions (7.1)</linkHtml>].</content>

                        <paragraph>In a placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, no difference was detected in antibody response to vaccine between CIMZIA and placebo treatment groups when the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine were administered concurrently with CIMZIA. Similar proportions of patients developed protective levels of anti-vaccine antibodies between CIMZIA and placebo treatment groups; however patients receiving CIMZIA and concomitant methotrexate had a lower humoral response compared with patients receiving CIMZIA alone.

                              <paragraph>The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of certolizumab pegol or of other certolizumab products.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients with Crohn's disease were tested at multiple time points for antibodies to certolizumab pegol during Studies CD1 and CD2. In patients continuously exposed to CIMZIA, the overall percentage of patients who were antibody positive to CIMZIA on at least one occasion was 8%; approximately 6% were neutralizing <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. No apparent correlation of antibody development to adverse events or efficacy was observed. Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressants had a lower rate of antibody development than patients not taking immunosuppressants at baseline (3% and 11%, respectively). The following adverse events were reported in Crohn's disease patients who were antibody-positive (N = 100) at an incidence at least 3% higher compared to antibody-negative patients (N = 1,242): abdominal pain, arthralgia, edema peripheral, erythema nodosum, injection site erythema, injection site pain, pain in extremity, and upper respiratory tract infection.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In two long-term (up to 7 years of exposure), open-label Crohn's disease studies, overall 23% (207/903) of patients developed antibodies against certolizumab pegol on at least one occasion.  Of the 207 patients who were antibody positive, 152 (73%) had a persistent reduction of drug plasma concentration, which represents 17% (152/903) of the study population.  The data from these two studies do not suggest an association between the development of antibodies and adverse events.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The overall percentage of patients with antibodies to certolizumab pegol detectable on at least one occasion was 7% (105 of 1,509) in the rheumatoid arthritis placebo-controlled trials. Approximately one third (3%, 39 of 1,509) of these patients had antibodies with neutralizing activity <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressants (MTX) had a lower rate of antibody development than patients not taking immunosuppressants at baseline. Patients treated with concomitant immunosuppressant therapy (MTX) in RA-I, RA-II, RA-III had a lower rate of neutralizing antibody formation overall than patients treated with CIMZIA monotherapy in RA-IV (2% vs. 8%). Both the loading dose of 400 mg every other week at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 and concomitant use of MTX were associated with reduced immunogenicity.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and reduced efficacy. In patients receiving the recommended CIMZIA dosage of 200 mg every other week with concomitant MTX, the ACR20 response was lower among antibody positive patients than among antibody-negative patients (Study RA-I, 48% versus 60%; Study RA-II 35% versus 59%, respectively). In Study RA-III, too few patients developed antibodies to allow for meaningful analysis of ACR20 response by antibody status. In Study RA-IV (monotherapy), the ACR20 response was 33% versus 56%, antibody-positive versus antibody-negative status, respectively <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]. </content>No association was seen between antibody development and the development of adverse events.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Approximately 8 % (22/265) and  19% (54/281) of subjects with psoriasis who received CIMZIA 400 mg every 2 weeks and CIMZIA 200 mg every 2 weeks for 48 weeks, respectively, developed antibodies to certolizumab pegol.  Of the subjects who developed antibodies to certolizumab pegol, 45% (27/60) had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Antibody formation was associated with lowered drug plasma concentration and reduced efficacy.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>A more sensitive and drug tolerant electrochemiluminesence (ECL)-based bridging assay was used for the first time in the nr-axSpA-1 study, resulting in a greater proportion of samples having measurable antibodies to certolizumab pegol and thus a greater incidence of patients being classed as antibody positive. In the placebo-controlled trial in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, after up to 52 weeks of treatment, the overall incidence of patients who were antibody positive to certolizumab pegol was 97% (248/255 patients). Of these antibody positive patients, higher titers were associated with reduced certolizumab pegol plasma levels.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The data above reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to certolizumab pegol in an ELISA or ECL-based bridging assay, and are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In a clinical study of pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis, immunogenicity was evaluated using an ECL-based assay. For the patients receiving the recommended CIMZIA dose, the incidence of treatment emergent-anti-certolizumab pegol antibody positivity was 92.4%  for the entire treatment period. Of these antibody positive patients, higher titers were associated with reduced certolizumab pegol plasma levels.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>An increased risk of serious infections has been seen in clinical studies of other TNF-blocking agents used in combination with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit. Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with rituximab or natalizumab. Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with these combinations with TNF blocker therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the use of CIMZIA in these combinations.

                        <paragraph>Interference with certain coagulation assays has been detected in patients treated with CIMZIA. Certolizumab pegol may cause erroneously elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay results in patients without coagulation abnormalities. This effect has been observed with the PTT-Lupus Anticoagulant (LA) test and Standard Target Activated Partial Thromboplastin time (STA-PTT) Automate tests from Diagnostica Stago, and the HemosIL APTT-SP liquid and HemosIL lyophilized silica tests from Instrumentation Laboratories. Other aPTT assays may be affected as well. Interference with thrombin time (TT) and prothrombin time (PT) assays has not been observed. There is no evidence that CIMZIA therapy has an effect on <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> coagulation.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Limited data from the ongoing pregnancy registry on use of CIMZIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a risk of major birth defects or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations obtained from two studies of CIMZIA use during the third trimester of pregnancy demonstrated that placental transfer of certolizumab pegol was negligible in most infants at birth, and low in other infants at birth <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#Data8.1">Data</linkHtml>)</content>. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with active rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. The theoretical risks of administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines to the infants exposed <content styleCode="italics">in utero</content> to CIMZIA should be weighed against the benefits of vaccinations <content styleCode="italics">(see <linkHtml href="#CC">Clinical Considerations</linkHtml>)</content>. No adverse developmental effects were observed in animal reproduction studies during which pregnant rats were administered intravenously a rodent anti-murine TNFÎ± pegylated Fab' fragment (cTN3 PF) similar to certolizumab pegol during organogenesis at up to 2.4 times the recommended human dose of 400 mg every four weeks.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>A limited number of pregnancies have been reported in the ongoing pregnancy exposure registry. Due to the small number of CIMZIA-exposed pregnancies with known outcomes (n=54), no meaningful comparisons between the exposed group and control groups may be conducted to determine an association with CIMZIA and major birth defects or adverse pregnancy outcomes.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>A multicenter clinical study was conducted in 16 women treated with CIMZIA at a maintenance dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks during the third trimester of pregnancy for rheumatological diseases or Crohn's disease. The last dose of CIMZIA was given on average 11 days prior to delivery (range 1 to 27 days).  Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations were measured in samples from mothers and infants using an assay that can measure certolizumab pegol concentrations at or above 0.032 mcg/mL.  Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations measured in the mothers at delivery (range: 4.96 to 49.4 mcg/mL) were consistent with non-pregnant women's plasma concentrations in Study RA-I <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S14.2">Clinical Studies (14.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.  Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations were not measurable in 13 out of 15 infants at birth.  The concentration of certolizumab pegol in one infant was 0.0422 mcg/mL at birth (infant/mother plasma ratio of 0.09%). In a second infant, delivered by emergency Caesarean section, the concentration was 0.485 mcg/mL (infant/mother plasma ratio of 4.49%).  At Week 4 and Week 8, all 15 infants had no measurable concentrations.  Among 16 exposed infants, one serious adverse reaction was reported in a neonate who was treated empirically with intravenous antibiotics due to an increased white blood cell count; blood cultures were negative. The certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations for this infant were not measurable at birth, Week 4, or Week 8. </paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>In another clinical study conducted in 10 pregnant women with CrohnÂ´s disease treated with CIMZIA (400 mg every 4 weeks for every mother),  certolizumab pegol concentrations were measured in maternal blood as well as in cord and infant blood at the day of birth with an assay that can measure concentrations at or above 0.41 mcg/mL. The last dose of CIMZIA was given on average 19 days prior to delivery (range 5 to 42 days). Plasma certolizumab pegol concentrations ranged from not measurable to 1.66 mcg/mL in cord blood  and 1.58 mcg/mL in infant blood; and ranged from 1.87 to 59.57 mcg/mL in maternal blood. Plasma certolizumab pegol concentrations were lower (by at least 75%) in the infants than in mothers suggesting low placental transfer of certolizumab pegol. In one infant, the plasma certolizumab pegol concentration declined from 1.02 to 0.84 mcg/mL over 4 weeks suggesting that certolizumab pegol may be eliminated at a slower rate in infants than adults.</paragraph>

The effects of certolizumab pegol on milk production were not studied. The concentration of certolizumab pegol in breast milk was not measurable in 77 (56 %) of the 137 samples taken over the dosing periods using an assay that can measure certolizumab pegol concentrations at or above 0.032 mcg/mL. The median of the estimated average daily infant doses was 0.0035 mg/kg/day (range: 0 to 0.01 mg/kg/day).  The percentage of the maternal dose (200 mg CIMZIA dosed once every 2 weeks), that reaches an infant ranged from 0.56% to 4.25% based on samples with measurable certolizumab pegol concentration.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Certolizumab pegol binds to human TNFÎ± with a KD of 90pM. TNFÎ± is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine with a central role in inflammatory processes. Certolizumab pegol selectively neutralizes TNFÎ± (IC<sub>90</sub> of 4 ng/mL for inhibition of human TNFÎ± in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> L929 murine fibrosarcoma cytotoxicity assay) but does not neutralize lymphotoxin Î± (TNFÎ²). Certolizumab pegol cross-reacts poorly with TNF from rodents and rabbits, therefore <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> efficacy was evaluated using animal models in which human TNFÎ± was the physiologically active molecule.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Certolizumab pegol was shown to neutralize membrane-associated and soluble human TNFÎ± in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation of monocytes with certolizumab pegol resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced TNFÎ± and IL-1Î² production in human monocytes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Certolizumab pegol does not contain a fragment crystallizable (Fc) region, which is normally present in a complete antibody, and therefore does not fix complement or cause antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity<content styleCode="italics"> in vitro</content>. It does not induce apoptosis <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> in human peripheral blood-derived monocytes or lymphocytes, nor does certolizumab pegol induce neutrophil degranulation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A tissue reactivity study was carried out <content styleCode="italics">ex vivo</content> to evaluate potential cross-reactivity of certolizumab pegol with cryosections of normal human tissues. Certolizumab pegol showed no reactivity with a designated standard panel of normal human tissues.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Biological activities ascribed to TNFÎ± include the upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules and chemokines, upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, and direct leukocyte activation. TNFÎ± stimulates the production of downstream inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor, and nitric oxide. Elevated levels of TNFÎ± have been implicated in the pathology of Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Certolizumab pegol binds to TNFÎ±, inhibiting its role as a key mediator of inflammation. TNFÎ± is strongly expressed in the bowel wall in areas involved by Crohn's disease and fecal concentrations of TNFÎ± in patients with Crohn's disease have been shown to reflect clinical severity of the disease. After treatment with certolizumab pegol, patients with Crohn's disease demonstrated a decrease in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Increased TNFÎ± levels are found in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and play an important role in the joint destruction that is a hallmark of this disease.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>A total of 126 healthy subjects received doses of up to 800 mg certolizumab pegol subcutaneously (sc) and up to 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) in four pharmacokinetic studies. Data from these studies demonstrate that single intravenous and subcutaneous doses of certolizumab pegol have predictable dose-related plasma concentrations with a linear relationship between the dose administered and the maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and the Area Under the certolizumab pegol plasma concentration versus time Curve (AUC). A mean C<sub>max</sub> of approximately 43 to 49 mcg/mL occurred at Week 5 during the initial loading dose period using the recommended dose regimen for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (400 mg sc at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 followed by 200 mg every other week).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations were broadly dose-proportional and pharmacokinetics observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and plaque psoriasis were consistent with those seen in healthy subjects.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Following subcutaneous administration, peak plasma concentrations of certolizumab pegol were attained between 54 and 171 hours post-injection. Certolizumab pegol has bioavailability (F) of approximately 80% (ranging from 76% to 88%) following subcutaneous administration compared to intravenous administration.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>PEGylation, the covalent attachment of PEG polymers to peptides, delays the metabolism and elimination of these entities from the circulation by a variety of mechanisms, including decreased renal clearance, proteolysis, and immunogenicity. Accordingly, certolizumab pegol is an antibody Fab' fragment conjugated with PEG in order to extend the terminal plasma elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of the Fab'. The terminal elimination phase half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was approximately 14 days for all doses tested. The clearance following IV administration to healthy subjects ranged from 9.21 mL/h to 14.38 mL/h. The clearance following sc dosing was estimated 17 mL/h in the Crohn's disease population PK analysis with an inter-subject variability of 38% (CV) and an inter-occasion variability of 16%.  Similarly, the clearance following sc dosing was estimated as 21.0 mL/h in the RA population PK analysis, with an inter-subject variability of 30.8% (%CV) and inter-occasion variability 22.0%. The clearance following subcutaneous dosing in patients with plaque psoriasis was 14 mL/h with an inter-subject variability of 22.2% (CV). The route of elimination of certolizumab pegol has not been studied in human subjects. Studies in animals indicate that the major route of elimination of the PEG component is via urinary excretion.</paragraph>

A population pharmacokinetic analysis was also conducted on data from patients with plaque psoriasis to evaluate the effect of age, gender, body weight, and presence of anti-certolizumab pegol antibodies. Only bodyweight and presence of anti-certolizumab antibodies significantly affected certolizumab pegol pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetic exposure was inversely related to body weight but pharmacodynamic exposure-response analysis showed that no additional therapeutic benefit would be expected from a weight-adjusted dose regimen. When assessed using the previous ELISA method, the presence of anti-certolizumab antibodies was associated with a â¥ 3 to 4 fold increase in clearance.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>In the JIA with active polyarthritis study (NCT01550003), the mean trough plasma concentrations at Week 12 (steady-state) were 31.8 Âµg/mL, 27.9 Âµg/mL, and 36.8 Âµg/mL for patients weighing 10 to &lt;20 kg, 20 to &lt;40 kg, and â¥40 kg, respectively. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that plasma concentrations in pediatric patients with JIA with active polyarthritis are in the same range as observed in adult patients with RA receiving a 200 mg Q2W maintenance dose.</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Similar to the adult indications, body weight and anti-certolizumab antibodies titers affected certolizumab pegol pharmacokinetics, where higher body weights and presence of anti-certolizumab antibodies was associated with lower exposures. There was no observed impact from the use of concomitant methotrexate on certolizumab pegol plasma concentrations.</paragraph>

The effect of methotrexate on CIMZIA pharmacokinetics was not studied. However, methotrexate-treated patients have lower incidence of antibodies to CIMZIA. Thus, therapeutic plasma levels are more likely to be sustained when CIMZIA is administered with methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Study CD1 was a randomized placebo-controlled study in 662 patients with active Crohn's disease. CIMZIA or placebo was administered at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 and then every four weeks to Week 24. Assessments were done at Weeks 6 and 26. Clinical response was defined as at least a 100-point reduction in CDAI score compared to baseline, and clinical remission was defined as an absolute CDAI score of 150 points or lower.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The results for Study CD1 are provided in Table 3. At Week 6, the proportion of clinical responders was statistically significantly greater for CIMZIA-treated patients compared to controls. The difference in clinical remission rates was not statistically significant at Week 6. The difference in the proportion of patients who were in clinical response at both Weeks 6 and 26 was also statistically significant, demonstrating maintenance of clinical response.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Study CD2 was a randomized treatment-withdrawal study in patients with active Crohn's disease. All patients who entered the study were dosed initially with CIMZIA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 and then assessed for clinical response at Week 6 (as defined by at least a 100-point reduction in CDAI score). At Week 6, a group of 428 clinical responders was randomized to receive either CIMZIA 400 mg or placebo, every four weeks starting at Week 8, as maintenance therapy through Week 24. Non-responders at Week 6 were withdrawn from the study. Final evaluation was based on the CDAI score at Week 26. Patients who withdrew or who received rescue therapy were considered not to be in clinical response. Three randomized responders received no study injections, and were excluded from the ITT analysis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The results for clinical response and remission are shown in Table 4. At Week 26, a statistically significantly greater proportion of Week 6 responders were in clinical response and in clinical remission in the CIMZIA-treated group compared to the group treated with placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of CIMZIA were assessed in four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies (RA-I, RA-II, RA-III, and RA-IV) in patients â¥ 18 years of age with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Patients had â¥ 9 swollen and tender joints and had active RA for at least 6 months prior to baseline. CIMZIA was administered subcutaneously in combination with MTX at stable doses of at least 10 mg weekly in Studies RA-I, RA-II, and RA-III. CIMZIA was administered as monotherapy in Study RA-IV.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study RA-I and Study RA-II evaluated patients who had received MTX for at least 6 months prior to study medication, but had an incomplete response to MTX alone. Patients were treated with a loading dose of 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either 200 mg or 400 mg of CIMZIA or placebo every other week, in combination with MTX for 52 weeks in Study RA-I and for 24 weeks in Study RA-II. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms and structural damage using the ACR20 response at Week 24 (RA-I and RA-II) and modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 52 (RA-I). The open-label extension follow-up study enrolled 846 patients who received 400 mg of CIMZIA every other week.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study RA-III evaluated 247 patients who had active disease despite receiving MTX for at least 6 months prior to study enrollment. Patients received 400 mg of CIMZIA every four weeks for 24 weeks without a prior loading dose. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms of RA using the ACR20 at Week 24.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study RA-IV (monotherapy) evaluated 220 patients who had failed at least one DMARD use prior to receiving CIMZIA. Patients were treated with CIMZIA 400 mg or placebo every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms of active RA using the ACR20 at Week 24.</paragraph>

CIMZIA-treated patients had higher ACR20, 50 and 70 response rates at 6 months compared to placebo-treated patients. The results in study RA-II (619 patients) were similar to the results in RA-I at Week 24. The results in study RA-III (247 patients) were similar to those seen in study RA-IV.

                              <paragraph>In Study RA-I, inhibition of progression of structural damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as the change in modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion Score (ES) and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score, at Week 52, compared to baseline. CIMZIA inhibited the progression of structural damage compared to placebo plus MTX after 12 months of treatment as shown in Table 7. In the placebo group, 52% of patients experienced no radiographic progression (mTSS â¤0.0) at Week 52 compared to 69% in the CIMZIA 200 mg every other week treatment group. Study RA-II showed similar results at Week 24.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of CIMZIA in pediatric patients with pJIA is based on pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of CIMZIA in RA patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of CIMZIA was also assessed in a multi-center, open-label study NCT01550003 in 193 patients 2 to 17 years of age with JIA with active polyarthritis with an inadequate response or intolerance to at least 1 DMARD (nonbiologic or biologic). Of those, 105 received the recommended dose. The patients had the following subtypes of JIA: polyarthritis rheumatoid factor-positive (20.0%), polyarthritis rheumatoid factor-negative (44.8%), extended oligoarthritis (13.3%), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (4.8%), and enthesitis-related arthritis (19.0%). Patients could be on stable methotrexate, glucocorticoids, and/or NSAIDs. Efficacy was assessed as secondary endpoints through Week 24. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in patients with RA.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of CIMZIA were assessed in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial (PsA001) in 409 patients aged 18 years and older with active psoriatic arthritis despite DMARD therapy. Patients in this study had â¥ 3 swollen and tender joints and adult-onset PsA of at least 6 months' duration as defined by the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis  (CASPAR) criteria, and increased acute phase reactants. Patients had failed one or more DMARDs. Previous treatment with one anti-TNF biologic therapy was allowed, and 20% of patients had prior anti-TNF biologic exposure. Patients receiving concomitant NSAIDs and conventional DMARDs were 73% and 70 % respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients received a loading dose of CIMZIA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either CIMZIA 200 mg every other week or CIMZIA 400 mg every 4 weeks or placebo every other week. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms and structural damage using the ACR20 response at Week 12 and modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Week 24.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The percentage of CIMZIA-treated patients achieving ACR20, 50 and 70 responses in study PsA001 are shown in Table 8. ACR20 response rates at weeks 12 and 24 were higher for each CIMZIA dose group relative to placebo (95% confidence intervals for CIMZIA 200 mg minus placebo at weeks 12 and 24 of (23%, 45%) and (30%, 51%), respectively and 95% confidence intervals for CIMZIA 400 mg minus placebo at weeks 12 and 24 of (17%, 39%) and (22%, 44%), respectively). The results of the components of the ACR response criteria are shown in Table 9.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients with enthesitis at baseline were evaluated for mean improvement in Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI). CIMZIA-treated patients receiving either 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks showed a reduction in enthesitis of 1.8 and 1.7, respectively as compared with a reduction in placebo-treated patients of 0.9 at week 12. Similar results were observed for this endpoint at week 24. Treatment with CIMZIA resulted in improvement in skin manifestations in patients with PsA.</paragraph>

The mTSS score was modified for psoriatic arthritis by addition of hand distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of CIMZIA were assessed in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (AS-1) in 325 patients â¥18 years of age with adult-onset active axial spondyloarthritis for at least 3 months.  The majority of patients in the study had active AS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) â¥4, and spinal pain â¥4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).  Patients must have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least one NSAID.  Patients were treated with a loading dose of CIMZIA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 (for both treatment arms) or placebo followed by either 200 mg of CIMZIA every 2 weeks or 400 mg of CIMZIA every 4 weeks or placebo.   Concomitant NSAIDs were received by 91% of the AS patients.  The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of patients achieving an ASAS20 response at Week 12.</paragraph>

Responses were similar in patients receiving CIMZIA 200 mg every 2 weeks and CIMZIA 400 mg every 4 weeks.  The results of the components of the ASAS response criteria and other measures of disease activity are shown in Table 11.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.6 	Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of CIMZIA were assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (nr-axSpA-1) (NCT02552212) in 317 subjects â¥18 years of age with adult-onset active axial spondyloarthritis for at least 12 months.  Patients must have had objective signs of inflammation indicated by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels above the upper limit of normal and/or sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), indicative of inflammatory disease [positive CRP (&gt; ULN) and/or positive MRI], but without definitive radiographic evidence of structural damage on sacroiliac joints. Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) â¥4, and spinal pain â¥4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).  Patients must have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs.  Patients were treated with a loading dose of CIMZIA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4 or placebo followed by 200 mg of CIMZIA every 2 weeks or placebo.  Utilization and dose adjustment of concomitant medications (including NSAIDs, DMARDs, corticosteroids, opioids) were permitted at any time.  Patients were allowed to transition to use of open-label CIMZIA at any time at the discretion of the investigator.  However, no patients transitioned before Week 12. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-Major Improvement (ASDAS-MI) response at Week 52.  The ASDAS is a composite weighted scoring system that assesses disease activity, including patient-reported outcomes and CRP levels.  A response in ASDAS-Major Improvement (MI) is indicated by a change from baseline of â¥2.0 in the ASDAS and/or reaching the lowest possible ASDAS value.</paragraph>

At both Weeks 12 and 52, ASAS40 responses were greater for patients treated with CIMZIA compared to patients treated with placebo (Table 12).  The components of the ASDAS-MI and ASAS response criteria are shown in Table 13.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Three multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies (Study PS-1 [NCT02326298], Study PS-2 [NCT02326272], and Study PS-3 [NCT02346240]) enrolled subjects 18 years of age or older with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were eligible for systemic therapy or phototherapy.  Subjects had a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of â¥ 3 ("moderate") on a 5-category scale of overall disease severity, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score â¥ 12, and body surface area (BSA) involvement of â¥ 10%.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies PS-1 (234 subjects) and PS-2 (227 subjects) randomized subjects to placebo, CIMZIA 200 mg every other week (following a loading dose of CIMZIA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4), or CIMZIA 400 mg every other week.  Studies PS-1 and PS-2 assessed the co-primary endpoints of the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 and PGA of "clear" or "almost clear" with at least a 2-point improvement at Week 16.  Other evaluated outcomes were PASI 90 at Week 16 and maintenance of efficacy to Week 48.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study PS-3 randomized 559 subjects to receive placebo, CIMZIA 200 mg every other week (following a loading dose of CIMZIA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4), CIMZIA 400 mg every other week up to Week 16, or a biologic comparator (up to Week 12).  Study PS-3 assessed the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 at Week 12 as the primary endpoint. Other evaluated outcomes were PGA of "clear" or "almost clear" at Week 16, PASI 75 at Week 16, PASI 90 at Week 16, and maintenance of efficacy to Week 48.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the 850 subjects randomized to receive placebo or CIMZIA in these placebo-controlled studies, 29% of patients were naÃ¯ve to prior systemic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis, 47% had received prior phototherapy or chemophototherapy, and 30% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis.  Of the 850 subjects, 14% had received at least one TNF alpha agent and 16% had received an anti-IL agent.  Eighteen percent of subjects reported a history of psoriatic arthritis at baseline.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Across all studies and treatment groups, the mean PASI score at baseline was 20 and ranged from 12 to 69. The baseline PGA score ranged from moderate (70%) to severe (30%). Mean baseline BSA was 25% and ranged from 10% to 96%. Subjects were predominantly men (64%) and White (94%), with a mean age of 46 years.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>CIMZIA Lyophilized powder should be prepared and administered by a health care professional.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Contents:<br/>2 inner kits, each containing 1 vial of CIMZIA 200 mg, 1 vial of sterile water for injection (USP 1 mL), 1 single-dose plastic syringe, 4 alcohol swabs, two reconstitution needles, and one dosing needle.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Refrigerate carton at 2 to 8Â°C (36 to 46Â°F).  DO NOT FREEZE.  Do not separate contents of carton prior to use.  Do not use beyond expiration date on container.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Unopened CIMZIA vials may also be stored at room temperature up to a maximum of 25Â°C (77Â°F) for 6 months, but not exceeding the original expiration date. If stored at room temperature, do not place back in refrigerator and write the new expiration date on the carton in the space provided.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If refrigerated, remove CIMZIA from the refrigerator and allow the vial(s) to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before reconstituting.  Do not warm the vial in any other way.  Using appropriate aseptic technique, reconstitute each lyophilized vial of CIMZIA with 1 mL of sterile water for injection using a syringe with a fresh 20-gauge needle.  The sterile water for injection should be directed at the vial wall rather than directly on CIMZIA. (See <linkHtml href="#F1">Figure 1</linkHtml>.)</paragraph>
                  <paragraph ID="F1">
                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM12"/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The resultant solution will contain 200 mg/mL.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Gently swirl each vial of CIMZIA for about one minute without shaking, ensuring that all of the powder comes into contact with the Sterile Water for Injection.  The swirling should be as gentle as possible in order to avoid creating a foaming effect. (See <linkHtml href="#F2">Figure 2</linkHtml>.)</paragraph>
                  <paragraph ID="F2">
                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM13"/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Continue swirling every 5 minutes as long as non-dissolved particles are observed.  Full reconstitution may take as long as 30 minutes.  The final reconstituted solution contains 200 mg/mL and should be clear to opalescent, colorless to yellow liquid and essentially free from particulates.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Once reconstituted, CIMZIA can be stored in the vials for up to 24 hours between 2Â° to 8Â° C (36Â° to 46Â° F) prior to injection.  Do not freeze.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>When ready to inject, reconstituted CIMZIA should be at room temperature.  Do not leave reconstituted CIMZIA at room temperature for more than 2 hours prior to administration.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Withdraw the reconstituted solution into a separate syringe for each vial using a new 20-gauge needle for each vial so that each syringe contains the required volume of CIMZIA. (See <linkHtml href="#F3">Figure 3</linkHtml>.)</paragraph>
                  <paragraph ID="F3">
                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM14"/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Replace the 20-gauge needle(s) on the syringes with a 23-gauge needle(s) for administration. (See <linkHtml href="#F4">Figure 4</linkHtml>.)</paragraph>

                     <renderMultiMedia referencedObject="MM15"/>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Inject the full contents of the syringe(s) subcutaneously by pinching the skin of the abdomen (See <linkHtml href="#fig5">Figure 5</linkHtml>) or thigh (See <linkHtml href="#fig6">Figure 6</linkHtml>).  Where a 400 mg dose is required, two injections are required. Therefore, separate sites should be used for each 200 mg injection.</paragraph>
