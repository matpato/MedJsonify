                        <paragraph>a. Place the specified amount of water into a polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) or glass bottle (see Table 4). Constitution in other bottle types is not recommended because there is no stability data with other bottle types.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>b. Carefully separate the capsule body and cap and pour the contents of the required number of oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg capsules into the PET or glass bottle.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>c. Gently swirl the suspension to ensure adequate wetting of the oseltamivir phosphate powder for at least 2 minutes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>d. Slowly add the specified amount of vehicle to the bottle.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>e. Close the bottle using a child-resistant cap and shake well for 30 seconds to completely dissolve the active drug and to ensure homogeneous distribution of the dissolved drug in the resulting suspension. The active drug, oseltamivir phosphate, readily dissolves in the specified vehicles. The suspension is caused by inert ingredients of oseltamivir phosphate capsules which are insoluble in these vehicles.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>There have been postmarketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir phosphate <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_ccdff37f-e5cb-48d9-8d6a-b39577f64f2e">Adverse Reactions (6.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir phosphate usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of oseltamivir phosphate to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. Closely monitor oseltamivir phosphate-treated patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing oseltamivir phosphate for each patient.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is no evidence for efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Oseltamivir phosphate has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The overall safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate is based on data from 2,646 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days for treatment of influenza and 1,943 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally once daily for up to 6 weeks for prophylaxis of influenza in clinical trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse reactions in the pooled treatment and pooled prophylaxis trials in adults and adolescents are displayed in Table 5. The majority of these adverse reactions were reported on a single occasion, occurred on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within 1 to 2 days. This summary includes otherwise healthy adults/adolescents and subjects “at risk” (subjects at higher risk of developing complications associated with influenza, e.g., elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, the safety profile in the subjects “at risk” was qualitatively similar to that in otherwise healthy adults/adolescents.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A total of 1,481 pediatric subjects (including otherwise healthy pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years and asthmatic pediatric subjects aged 6 to 12 years) participated in clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza. A total of 859 pediatric subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension either at a 2 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days or weight-band dosing. Vomiting was the only adverse reaction reported at a frequency of ≥ 1% in subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate (16%) compared to placebo (8%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Amongst the 148 pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years who received oseltamivir phosphate at doses of 30 to 60 mg once daily for 10 days in a post-exposure prophylaxis study in household contacts (n = 99), and in a separate 6-week seasonal influenza prophylaxis safety study (n = 49), vomiting was the most frequent adverse reaction (8% on oseltamivir phosphate versus 2% in the no prophylaxis group).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Assessment of adverse reactions in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age was based on two open-label studies that included safety data on 135 influenza-infected subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age) exposed to oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg of the formulation for oral suspension twice daily orally for 5 days. The safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate was similar across the age range studied, with vomiting (9%), diarrhea (7%) and diaper rash (7%) being the most frequently reported adverse reactions, and was generally comparable to that observed in older pediatric and adult subjects.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with oseltamivir phosphate in pregnant women to inform a drug‐associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. Available published epidemiological data suggest that oseltamivir phosphate, taken in any trimester, is not associated with an increased risk of birth defects. However, these studies individually are limited by small sample sizes, use of different comparison groups, and some lacked information on dose, which preclude a definitive assessment of the risk <content styleCode="italics">[see Data and <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_1d3bcc46-de57-4217-bfb8-02f7aa3b1fa4">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>]</content>. In animal reproduction studies with oseltamivir, no adverse developmental effects were observed at clinically relevant exposures <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Published prospective and retrospective observational studies of more than 5,000 women exposed to oseltamivir phosphate during pregnancy, including more than 1,000 women exposed in the first trimester, suggest that the observed rate of congenital malformations was not increased above the rate in the general comparison population, regardless of when therapy was administered during the gestational period. However, individually, none of these studies had adequate sample sizes and some lacked information on dose, which preclude a definitive assessment of the risk.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Oseltamivir was administered orally during organogenesis to pregnant rats (at 50, 250, or 1,500 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 to 17) and rabbits (at 50, 150, or 500 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 to 18). In rats, embryo‐fetal effects consisting of an increased incidence of minor skeletal malformations were observed at a maternally toxic dose (1,500 mg/kg/day), resulting in systemic drug exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) 190 times human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice a day). In the rabbit study, embryo‐fetal effects consisting of an increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities and variants were observed at maternally toxic doses (≥ 150 mg/kg/day) resulting in systemic exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) ≥ 8 times human exposures at the MRHD of oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In prenatal and postnatal development studies in rats, oseltamivir was administered orally (at 50, 250, 500, or 1500 mg/kg/day) from organogenesis through late gestation, delivery, and lactation (gestation day 6 to postpartum/lactation day 20). Prolonged parturition duration and reduced offspring viability were observed at a maternally toxic dose (1,500 mg/kg/day). No adverse maternal or offspring effects were observed at doses ≤ 500 mg/kg/day, resulting in systemic drug exposures (based on AUC for oseltamivir carboxylate) 44 times human exposures at the MRHD of oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> Based on limited published data, oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate have been shown to be present in human milk at low levels considered unlikely to lead to toxicity in the breastfed infant. Postmarketing experience has not reported any information to suggest serious adverse effects of oseltamivir exposure via breast milk in infants. It is not known if oseltamivir affects human milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for oseltamivir phosphate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition.</paragraph>

Drug interactions involving competition for esterases have not been extensively reported in literature. Low protein binding of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate suggests that the probability of drug displacement interactions is low.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oseltamivir phosphate is an ethyl ester prodrug requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, oseltamivir carboxylate. Oseltamivir carboxylate is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase affecting release of viral particles. The median IC<sub>50</sub> values of oseltamivir against influenza A/H1N1, influenza A/H3N2, and influenza B clinical isolates were 2.5 nM (range 0.93 to 4.16 nM, N=74), 0.96 nM (range 0.13 to 7.95 nM, N=774), and 60 nM (20 to 285 nM, N=256), respectively, in a neuraminidase assay with a fluorescently labeled MUNANA substrate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The antiviral activity of oseltamivir carboxylate against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza virus was determined in cell culture. The concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate required for inhibition of influenza virus in cell culture were highly variable depending on the assay method used and the virus tested. The 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>90</sub>) were in the range of 0.0008 micromolar to greater than 35 micromolar and 0.004 micromolar to greater than 100 micromolar, respectively (1 micromolar=0.284 microgram per mL). The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture, inhibitory activity in the neuraminidase assay, and the inhibition of influenza virus replication in humans has not been established.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cell culture studies: Influenza A virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate have been recovered by serial passage of virus in cell culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of oseltamivir carboxylate. Reduced susceptibility of influenza virus to inhibition by oseltamivir carboxylate may be conferred by amino acid substitutions in the viral neuraminidase and/or hemagglutinin proteins.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinical studies: Reduced susceptibility isolates have been obtained during treatment with oseltamivir and from sampling during community surveillance studies. Changes in the viral neuraminidase that have been associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate are summarized in Table 8. The clinical impact of this reduced susceptibility is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hemagglutinin (HA) substitutions selected in cell culture and associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir include (influenza virus subtype-specific numbering) A11T, K173E, and R453M in H3N2; and H99Q in influenza B virus (Yamagata lineage). In some cases, HA substitutions were selected in conjunction with known NA resistance substitutions and may contribute to reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir; however, the impact of HA substitutions on antiviral activity of oseltamivir in humans is unknown and likely to be strain-dependent.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Circulating seasonal influenza strains expressing neuraminidase resistance-associated substitutions have been observed in individuals who have not received oseltamivir treatment. The oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution H275Y was found in more than 99% of US-circulating 2008 H1N1 influenza virus isolates. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (“swine flu”) was almost uniformly susceptible to oseltamivir; however, the frequency of circulating resistant variants can change from season to season. Prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Cross-resistance between oseltamivir and zanamivir has been observed in neuraminidase biochemical assays. The H275Y (N1 numbering) or N294S (N2 numbering) oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in the N1 neuraminidase subtype, and the E119V or N294S oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in the N2 subtype (N2 numbering), are associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir but not zanamivir. The Q136K and K150T zanamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in N1 neuraminidase, or the S250G zanamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in influenza B virus neuraminidase, confer reduced susceptibility to zanamivir but not oseltamivir. The R292K oseltamivir resistance-associated substitution observed in N2, and the I222T, D198E/N, R371K, or G402S oseltamivir resistance-associated substitutions observed in influenza B virus neuraminidase, confer reduced susceptibility to both oseltamivir and zanamivir. These examples do not represent an exhaustive list of cross resistance-associated substitutions and prescribers should consider available information from the CDC on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No single amino acid substitution has been identified that could confer cross-resistance between the neuraminidase inhibitor class (oseltamivir, zanamivir) and the M2 ion channel inhibitor class (amantadine, rimantadine). However, a virus may carry a neuraminidase inhibitor-associated substitution in neuraminidase and an M2 ion channel inhibitor-associated substitution in M2 and may therefore be resistant to both classes of inhibitors. The clinical relevance of phenotypic cross-resistance evaluations has not been established.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats given daily oral doses of the prodrug oseltamivir phosphate up to 400 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, respectively, the prodrug and the active form oseltamivir carboxylate induced no statistically significant increases in tumors over controls. The mean maximum daily exposures to the prodrug in mice and rats were approximately 130- and 320-fold, respectively, greater than those in humans at the recommended clinical dose based on AUC comparisons. The respective safety margins of the exposures to the active oseltamivir carboxylate were 15- and 50-fold.</paragraph>

It was found to be positive in a Syrian Hamster Embryo (SHE) cell transformation test. Oseltamivir carboxylate was non-mutagenic in the Ames test and the L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay with and without enzymatic activation and negative in the SHE cell transformation test.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, doses of oseltamivir at 50, 250, and 1500 mg/kg/day were administered to females for 2 weeks before mating, during mating and until day 6 of pregnancy. Males were dosed for 4 weeks before mating, during mating, and for 2 weeks after mating. There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development at any dose level. The highest dose in this study was approximately 115 times the human systemic exposure (AUC<sub>0-24h</sub>) of oseltamivir carboxylate that occurs after administration of the maximum recommended human dose.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate were conducted in adults between 18 and 65 years old, one in the U.S. and one outside the U.S., for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Eligible subjects had fever of at least 100ºF, accompanied by at least one respiratory symptom (cough, nasal symptoms, or sore throat) and at least one systemic symptom (myalgia, chills/sweats, malaise, fatigue, or headache), and influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Subjects were randomized to receive oral oseltamivir phosphate or placebo for 5 days. All enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever-reducing medications.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of 1,355 subjects enrolled in these two trials, 849 (63%) subjects were influenza-infected (median age 34 years; 52% male; 90% Caucasian; 31% smokers). Of the 849 influenza-infected subjects, 95% were infected with influenza A, 3% with influenza B, and 2% with influenza of unknown type.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study medication was started within 40 hours of onset of symptoms and administered twice daily for 5 days. Subjects were required to self-assess the influenza-associated symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches, fatigue, headaches, and chills/sweats) twice daily as “none,” “mild,” “moderate,” or “severe”. Time to improvement was calculated from the time of treatment initiation to the time when all symptoms were assessed as “none” or “mild”. In both trials, there was a 1.3-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice a day for 5 days compared to subjects who received placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in men and women.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the treatment of influenza, no increased efficacy was demonstrated in subjects who received higher doses of oseltamivir phosphate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was unable to demonstrate efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) in the treatment of influenza in adult and adolescent subjects (13 years or older) with chronic cardiac (excluding chronic idiopathic hypertension) or respiratory diseases, as measured by time to alleviation of all symptoms. However, in patients treated with oseltamivir phosphate there was a more rapid cessation of febrile illness. No difference in the incidence of influenza complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Three double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trials were conducted in subjects who were at least 65 years of age in three consecutive seasons. The enrollment criteria were similar to that of adult trials with the exception of fever being defined as higher than 97.5°F. Of 741 subjects enrolled, 476 (65%) subjects were influenza-infected; of these, 95% were infected with influenza type A and 5% with influenza type B.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the pooled analysis, there was a 1-day reduction in the median time to improvement in influenza-infected subjects who received oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg twice daily for 5 days compared to those who received placebo (p=NS) <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_1ba70efa-3f59-4ca4-bd18-d2b2f7217ba4">Use in Specific Populations (8.5)</linkHtml>]</content>.

                        <paragraph>One double-blind placebo-controlled treatment trial was conducted in pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years (median age 5 years) who had fever (at least 100ºF) plus one respiratory symptom (cough or coryza) when influenza virus was known to be circulating in the community. Of 698 subjects enrolled in this trial, 452 (65%) were influenza-infected (50% male; 68% Caucasian). Of the 452 influenza-infected subjects, 67% were infected with influenza A and 33% with influenza B.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy in this trial was determined by the time to alleviation or resolution of influenza signs and symptoms, measured by a composite endpoint that required the following four individual conditions be met: i) alleviation of cough, ii) alleviation of coryza, iii) resolution of fever, and iv) parental opinion of a return to normal health and activity. Oseltamivir phosphate treatment of 2 mg per kg twice daily, started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, reduced the total composite time to freedom from illness by 1.5 days compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses by gender showed no differences in the treatment effect of oseltamivir phosphate in male and female pediatric subjects. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two open-label trials evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in influenza-infected pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age). Subjects received oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days depending on subject age. These clinical trials were not designed to evaluate clinical efficacy or virologic response.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the 136 subjects under the age of 1 year enrolled and dosed in the trials, the majority of the subjects were male (55%), white (79%), non-Hispanic (74%), full term (76%) and infected with influenza A (80%).

Median time since transplant for solid organ transplant recipients was 1,105 days for the placebo group and 1,379 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Median time since transplant for hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients was 424 days for the placebo group and 367 days for the oseltamivir phosphate group. Approximately 40% of subjects received influenza vaccine prior to entering the study. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of confirmed clinical influenza, defined as oral temperature higher than 99°F (37.2°C) plus cough and/or coryza, all recorded within 24 hours, plus either a positive virus culture or a four-fold increase in virus antibody titers from baseline. Subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg or placebo once daily by mouth for 12 weeks. The incidence of confirmed clinical influenza was 3% (7/238) in the placebo group compared with 2% (5/237) in the oseltamivir phosphate group; this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis was performed using the same clinical symptoms and RT-PCR for laboratory confirmation of influenza infection. Among subjects who were not already shedding virus at baseline, the incidence of RT-PCR-confirmed clinical influenza infection was 3% (7/231) in the placebo group and &lt;1% (1/232) in the oseltamivir phosphate group.</paragraph>
