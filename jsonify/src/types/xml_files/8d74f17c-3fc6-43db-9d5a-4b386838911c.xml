                              <paragraph>The initial dose of Nplate is 1 mcg/kg. Actual body weight at initiation of treatment should always be used when calculating initial dose. In pediatric patients, future dose adjustments are based on changes in platelet counts and changes in body weight. Reassessment of body weight is recommended every 12 weeks.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Adjust the weekly dose of Nplate by increments of 1 mcg/kg until the patient achieves a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding; do not exceed a maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. In a pediatric placebo-controlled clinical study, the median of the most frequent dose of Nplate received by patients during weeks 17 through 24 was 5.5 mcg/kg.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Progression from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been observed in adult clinical trials with Nplate.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling adult patients with severe thrombocytopenia and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low or intermediate-1 risk MDS was terminated due to more cases of AML observed in the Nplate arm. This trial consisted of a 58-week study period with a 5-year long-term follow-up phase. The patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with Nplate or placebo (167 Nplate, 83 placebo). During the 58-week study period, progression to AML occurred in 10 (6.0%) patients in the Nplate arm and 4 (4.8%) patients in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [95%CI] = 1.20 [0.38, 3.84]). Of the 250 patients, 210 (84.0%) entered the long-term follow-up phase of this study. With 5 years of follow-up, 29 (11.6%) patients showed progression to AML, including 20/168 (11.9%) patients in the Nplate arm versus 9/82 (11.0%) patients in the placebo arm (HR [95% CI] = 1.06 [0.48, 2.33]). The incidence of death (overall survival) was 55.7% (93/167) in the Nplate arm versus 54.2% (45/83) in the placebo arm (HR [95% CI] = 1.03 [0.72, 1.47]). In the baseline low IPSS group, there was a higher incidence of death in the Nplate arm [41.3% (19/46)] compared to the placebo arm [30.4% (7/23)] (HR [95% CI] = 1.59 [0.67, 3.80]).  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a single-arm trial of Nplate given to 72 patients with thrombocytopenia-related MDS, 8 (11.1%) patients were reported as having possible disease progression, of which 3 (4.2%) had confirmation of AML during follow-up. In addition, in 3 (4.2%) patients, increased peripheral blood blast cell counts decreased to baseline after discontinuation of Nplate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Nplate is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any cause of thrombocytopenia other than ITP.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The data described below reflect Nplate exposure to 271 adult patients with ITP, aged 18 to 88, of whom 62% were female. Nplate was studied in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies that were identical in design, with the exception that Study 1 evaluated non-splenectomized patients with ITP and Study 2 evaluated splenectomized patients with ITP. Data are also reported from an open-label, single-arm study in which patients received Nplate over an extended period of time. Overall, Nplate was administered to 114 patients for at least 52 weeks and 53 patients for at least 96 weeks.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the placebo-controlled studies, headache was the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction, occurring in 35% of patients receiving Nplate and 32% of patients receiving placebo. For those patients receiving Nplate, 14 (48%) of headaches were mild, 9 (31%) were moderate, and 6 (21%) were severe. Table 3 presents adverse drug reactions from Studies 1 and 2 with a ≥ 5% higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Nplate administration may increase the risk for development or progression of reticulin fiber formation within the bone marrow. This formation may improve upon discontinuation of Nplate. In a clinical trial, one patient with ITP and hemolytic anemia developed marrow fibrosis with collagen during Nplate therapy.  An open-label clinical trial prospectively evaluated changes in bone marrow reticulin formation and collagen fibrosis in adult patients with ITP treated with Nplate or a non-US approved romiplostim product. Patients were administered romiplostim by SC injection once weekly for up to 3 years. Based on cohort assignment at time of study enrollment, patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin and collagen at year 1 (cohort 1), year 2 (cohort 2), or year 3 (cohort 3) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at start of the trial. Patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin formation and collagen fibrosis using the modified Bauermeister grading scale. From the total of 169 patients enrolled in the 3 cohorts, 132 (78%) patients were evaluable for bone marrow collagen fibrosis and 131 (78%) patients were evaluable for bone marrow reticulin formation. Two percent (2/132) of patients (both from cohort 3) developed Grade 4 findings (presence of collagen). There was no detectable bone marrow collagen in one patient on repeat testing 12 weeks after discontinuation of romiplostim. Progression of bone marrow reticulin formation (increase greater than or equal to 2 grades or more) or an increase to Grade 4 (presence of collagen) was reported in 7% (9/131) of patients. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The open-label long-term study also evaluated changes in bone marrow reticulin and collagen formation. The modified Bauermeister grading scale was used for both assessments. Based on cohort assignment at the time of study enrollment, patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin and collagen at year 1 (cohort 1) or year 2 (cohort 2) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at the start of the study. From the total of 79 patients enrolled in the 2 cohorts, 27 (90%) patients in cohort 1 and 36 (73.5%) patients in cohort 2 had evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsies. Increased reticulin fiber formation was reported for 18.5% (5 of 27) of patients in cohort 1 and 47.2% (17 of 36) of patients in cohort 2, with a maximum grade of 2. No patients in either cohort developed collagen fibrosis (defined as grade 4) or a bone marrow abnormality that was inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph> </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Nplate in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Patients were screened for immunogenicity to romiplostim using a BIAcore-based biosensor immunoassay. This assay is capable of detecting both high- and low-affinity binding antibodies that bind to romiplostim and cross-react with TPO. The samples from patients that tested positive for binding antibodies were further evaluated for neutralizing capacity using a cell-based bioassay.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In adult clinical studies in adult patients with ITP, the incidence of pre-existing antibodies to romiplostim was 3.3% (35/1046) and the incidence of binding antibody development during treatment with Nplate or a non-US approved romiplostim product was 5.7% (60/1046). The incidence of pre-existing antibodies to endogenous TPO was 3% (31/1046) and the incidence of binding antibody development to endogenous TPO during treatment was 3.2% (33/1046). Of the patients with positive binding antibodies that developed to romiplostim or to TPO, four patients had neutralizing activity to romiplostim and none had neutralizing activity to TPO. No apparent correlation was observed between antibody activity and clinical effectiveness or safety.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In pediatric studies, data on antibody formation was collected from 282 patients (20 from early phase studies, 59 from phase 3 studies with duration of 6 months and 203 from a long-term study with median duration of 3 years). The incidence of binding antibodies to Nplate at any time was 9.6% (27/282), of which 2 patients (0.7%) had pre-existing binding non-neutralizing Nplate antibodies at baseline and 11 patients (3.9%) had persistent binding antibody positivity at end of study. Additionally, 2.8% (8/282) developed neutralizing antibodies to Nplate, with 4 patients (1.4%) having persistent neutralizing antibody positivity at end of study, despite discontinuation of Nplate. The incidence of binding antibodies to TPO at any time was 3.9% (11/282), of which 2 patients (0.7%) had pre-existing binding non-neutralizing antibodies to TPO at baseline and 1 patient (0.4%) had binding persistent antibody positivity at end of study. One patient (0.4%) had a weakly positive postbaseline result for neutralizing antibodies against TPO while on study (with positive non-neutralizing antibodies to Nplate) with a negative result at baseline for both antibodies. The patient showed a transient antibody response for neutralizing antibodies against TPO, with a negative result at the patient's last timepoint tested within the study period after discontinuation of Nplate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A postmarketing registry study involving patients with thrombocytopenia on Nplate or a non-US approved romiplostim product was conducted to assess the long-term consequences of the anti-romiplostim antibodies. Adult patients who lacked response or lost response to Nplate or a non-US approved romiplostim product were enrolled. The incidence of new binding antibody development was 3.8% (7/184) to romiplostim and 2.2% (4/184) were positive for binding, non-neutralizing antibodies to TPO; two patients were positive for binding antibodies to both romiplostim and TPO. Of the seven patients with positive binding antibodies to romiplostim, one patient (0.5%; 1/184) was positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim only.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Nineteen confirmed pediatric patients were included in the postmarketing registry study. The incidence of binding antibody post treatment was 16% (3/19) to romiplostim, of which 5.3% (1/19) were positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim. There were no antibodies detected to TPO.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay used in detection and may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to romiplostim with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, Nplate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Available data with Nplate use in pregnant women are insufficient to draw conclusions about any drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, romiplostim crossed the placenta, and adverse fetal effects included thrombocytosis, postimplantation loss, and an increase in pup mortality <content styleCode="italics">(see Data</content>).  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In rat and rabbit embryo-fetal development toxicity studies, no evidence of fetal harm was observed at romiplostim doses up to 11 times (rats) and 82 times (rabbits) the maximum human dose (MHD) based on systemic exposure (AUC). In mice at doses 5 times the MHD, reductions in maternal body weight and increased postimplantation loss occurred.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a prenatal and postnatal development study in rats, at doses 11 times the MHD, there was an increase in perinatal pup mortality. Romiplostim crossed the placental barrier in rats and increased fetal platelet counts at clinically equivalent and higher doses.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In clinical studies, treatment with Nplate resulted in dose-dependent increases in platelet counts. After a single subcutaneous dose of 1 to 10 mcg/kg Nplate in patients with ITP, the peak platelet count was 1.3 to 14.9 times greater than the baseline platelet count over a 2- to 3-week period. The platelet counts were above 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L for seven out of eight patients with ITP who received six weekly doses of Nplate at 1 mcg/kg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a clinical study, peak platelet count increased 4.7 to 7.3 fold (mean: 5.8 fold) above baseline values in healthy adults (n = 4) administered a single 10 mcg/kg IV dose of Nplate.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In the long-term extension study in adult patients with ITP receiving weekly treatment of Nplate subcutaneously, the pharmacokinetics of romiplostim over the dose range of 3 to 15 mcg/kg indicated that peak serum concentrations of romiplostim were observed about 7 to 50 hours post dose (median: 14 hours) with half-life values ranging from 1 to 34 days (median: 3.5 days). The serum concentrations varied among patients and did not correlate with the dose administered. The elimination of serum romiplostim is in part dependent on the TPO receptor on platelets. As a result, for a given dose, patients with high platelet counts are associated with low serum concentrations and vice versa. In another ITP clinical study, no accumulation in serum concentrations was observed (n = 4) after six weekly doses of Nplate (3 mcg/kg). The accumulation at higher doses of romiplostim is unknown.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in which rats were dosed subcutaneously three times per week, romiplostim caused extramedullary hematopoiesis, bone hyperostosis, and marrow fibrosis at clinically equivalent and higher doses. In this study, these findings were not observed in animals after a 4-week post treatment recovery period. Studies of long-term treatment with romiplostim in rats have not been conducted; therefore, it is not known if the fibrosis of the bone marrow is reversible in rats after long-term treatment. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In Studies 1 and 2, patients with ITP who had completed at least one prior treatment and had a platelet count of ≤ 30 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L prior to study entry were randomized (2:1) to 24 weeks of Nplate (1 mcg/kg subcutaneous [SC]) or placebo. The median time since ITP diagnosis for Studies 1 and 2 was 2.1 years (range 0.1 to 31.6) and 8 years (range 0.6 to 44.8), respectively. Prior ITP treatments in both study groups included corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, rituximab, cytotoxic therapies, danazol, and azathioprine. Patients already receiving ITP medical therapies at a constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments throughout the studies. Rescue therapies (i.e., corticosteroids, IVIG, platelet transfusions, and anti-D immunoglobulin) were permitted for bleeding, wet purpura, or if the patient was at immediate risk for hemorrhage. Patients received single weekly SC injections of Nplate, with individual dose adjustments to maintain platelet counts (50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 200 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study 1 evaluated patients who had not undergone a splenectomy. The patients had been diagnosed with ITP for approximately 2 years and had received a median of three prior ITP treatments. Overall, the median platelet count was 19 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at study entry. During the study, the median weekly Nplate dose was 2 mcg/kg (25<sup>th</sup>–75<sup>th</sup> percentile: 1–3 mcg/kg).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study 2 evaluated patients who had undergone a splenectomy. The patients had been diagnosed with ITP for approximately 8 years and had received a median of six prior ITP treatments. Overall, the median platelet count was 14 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at study entry. During the study, the median weekly Nplate dose was 3 mcg/kg (25<sup>th</sup>–75<sup>th</sup> percentile:  2–7 mcg/kg). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study 1 and 2 outcomes are shown in Table 5. A durable platelet response was the achievement of a weekly platelet count ≥ 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L for any 6 of the last 8 weeks of the 24-week treatment period in the absence of rescue medication at any time. A transient platelet response was the achievement of any weekly platelet counts ≥ 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L for any 4 weeks during the treatment period without a durable platelet response. An overall platelet response was the achievement of either a durable or a transient platelet response. Platelet responses were excluded for 8 weeks after receiving rescue medications.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Study 3 was a single-arm, open-label study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Nplate in adult patients who had an insufficient response (platelet count ≤ 30 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) to first-line therapy.  The study enrolled 75 patients of whom the median age was 39 years (range 19 to 85) and 59% were female. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median time from ITP diagnosis to study enrollment was 2.2 months (range 0.1 to 6.6).  Sixty percent of patients had ITP duration &lt; 3 months and 40% had ITP duration ≥ 3 months.  The median platelet count at screening was 20 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.  Prior ITP treatments included corticosteroids, immunoglobulins and anti-D immunoglobulins.  Patients already receiving ITP medical therapies at a constant dosing schedule were allowed to continue receiving these medical treatments throughout the studies.  Rescue therapies (i.e., corticosteroids, IVIG, platelet transfusions, anti-D immunoglobulin, dapsone, danazol, and azathioprine) were permitted. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients received single weekly SC injections of Nplate over a 12-month treatment period, with individual dose adjustments to maintain platelet counts (50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 200 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L).  During the study, the median weekly Nplate dose was 3 mcg/kg (25<sup>th</sup>-75<sup>th</sup> percentile: 2-4 mcg/kg). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Of the 75 patients enrolled in Study 3, 70 (93%) had a platelet response ≥ 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L during the 12-month treatment period.  The mean number of months with platelet response during the 12-month treatment period was 9.2 (95% CI: 8.3, 10.1) months; the median was 11 (95% CI: 10, 11) months.  The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time to first platelet response was 2.1 weeks (95% CI: 1.1, 3.0).  Twenty-four (32%) patients maintained every platelet count ≥ 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L for at least 6 months in the absence of Nplate and any medication for ITP (concomitant or rescue); the median time to onset of maintaining every platelet count ≥ 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L for at least 6 months was 27 weeks (range 6 to 57). </paragraph>

Among 291 patients who subsequently entered the extension study and received Nplate, platelet counts were increased and sustained regardless of whether they had received Nplate or placebo in the prior placebo-controlled studies. The majority of patients reached a median platelet count of 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L after receiving one to three doses of Nplate, and these platelet counts were maintained throughout the remainder of the study with a median duration of Nplate treatment of 78 weeks and a maximum duration of 277 weeks.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In Study 5, patients refractory or relapsed after at least one prior ITP therapy with a platelet count ≤ 30 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L were stratified by age and randomized (2:1) to receive Nplate (n = 42) or placebo (n = 20). The starting dose for all ages was 1 mcg/kg weekly. Over a 24-week treatment period, dose was titrated up to a maximum of 10 mcg/kg weekly of either Nplate or placebo in an effort to maintain a target platelet count of ≥ 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 200 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age of the patients was 9.5 years (range 3 to 17) and 57% were female. Approximately 58% of patients had a baseline count ≤ 20 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, which was similar between treatment arms. The percentage of patients with at least 2 prior ITP therapies (predominantly immunoglobulins and corticosteroids) was 81% in the group treated with Nplate and 70% in the group treated with placebo. One patient in each group had undergone splenectomy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study 5 results are shown in Table 6. The efficacy of Nplate in this trial was measured by the proportion of patients receiving Nplate achieving a durable platelet response and the proportion of patient achieving an overall platelet response. A durable platelet response was defined as achieving at least 6 weekly platelet counts ≥ 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L during weeks 18 through 25 of treatment. A transient platelet response was defined as a weekly platelet count ≥ 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L for 4 or more times during weeks 2 through 25, but without durable platelet response. An overall platelet response was defined as a durable or a transient platelet response. Platelet responses were excluded for 4 weeks after receiving rescue medications.</paragraph>

Nplate was administered weekly for up to 3 years by subcutaneous injection starting at a dose of 1 mcg/kg with weekly increments to a maximum dose of 10 mcg/kg to reach a target platelet count between 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and 200 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. The median age of the patients was 10 years (range 1 to 17 years) and the median and maximum duration of treatment were 156 weeks and 163 weeks, respectively. Among the 203 patients, the mean (SD) and median percentage of time with a platelet response (platelet count ≥ 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) within the first 6 months of initiation of Nplate without rescue medication use for the past 4 weeks was 50.6% (37) and 50.0%, respectively. Sixty (29.6%) subjects overall received rescue medications. Rescue medications (i.e., corticosteroids, platelet transfusions, IVIG, azathioprine, anti-D immunoglobulin, and danazol) were permitted.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy studies of Nplate could not be conducted in humans with acute radiation syndrome for ethical and feasibility reasons. Approval for this indication was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals, Nplate's effect on platelet count in healthy human volunteers and on data supporting Nplate's effect on thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP and insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of the uncertainty associated with extrapolating animal efficacy data to humans, the selection of a human dose for Nplate is aimed at providing platelet response to Nplate that is similar to that observed in efficacy studies conducted in animals. The recommended dose of Nplate for patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation is 10 mcg/kg administered once as a subcutaneous injection <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#_2_2_Preparation_and">Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. The 10 mcg/kg dosing regimen for humans is based on population modeling and simulation analyses. For pediatric patients (including term neonates), extrapolation was based on data supporting Nplate's effect on thrombocytopenia in patients with ITP and an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of Nplate for the acute radiation syndrome setting was assessed based on the clinical experience in patients with ITP <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6">Adverse Reactions (6)</linkHtml>]</content> and from a study with healthy volunteers. The efficacy of Nplate was studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in a non-human primate model of radiation injury. Rhesus monkeys were randomized to either a control (n = 40) or treated (n = 40) cohort.  Animals were exposed to total body irradiation (TBI) of 6.8 Gy from a Cobalt<sup>60</sup> gamma ray source, representing a dose that would be lethal in 70% of animals by 60 days of follow-up (LD<sub>70/60</sub>). Animals were administered a single subcutaneous dose of blinded treatment (control article [sterile saline] or Nplate [5mg/kg]) 24 hours post-irradiation. The primary efficacy endpoint was survival. Animals received medical management consisting of intravenous or subcutaneous fluids, anti-ulcer medication, anti-emetic medication, analgesics, antimicrobials, and other support as required.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Nplate significantly (one-sided p = 0.0002) increased 60-day survival in the irradiated animals: 72.5% survival (29/40) in the Nplate group compared to 32.5% survival (13/40) in the control group. In the same study, an exploratory cohort of n=40 animals received Nplate (5mg/kg) on day 1 and pegfilgrastim (0.3mg/kg) on days 1 and 8 post-irradiation. Survival in this combined treatment group was 87.5% (95% CI: (73.2%, 95.8%)).</paragraph>
