                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Rizatriptan benzoate should not be given to patients with ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of rizatriptan benzoate. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known coronary artery disease (CAD). 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal’s Angina), even in patients without a history of CAD.<br/>
                           <br/> Triptan-naïve patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) should have a cardiovascular evaluation prior to receiving rizatriptan benzoate. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#_RefSection_4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]. </content>For patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consideration should be given to administration of the first rizatriptan benzoate dose in a medically-supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following rizatriptan benzoate administration. Periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be considered in intermittent long-term users of rizatriptan benzoate who have cardiovascular risk factors.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>As with other 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists, sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck and jaw commonly occur after treatment with rizatriptan benzoate and are usually non‑-cardiac in origin. However, if a cardiac origin is suspected, patients should be evaluated.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue rizatriptan benzoate if a cerebrovascular event occurs.<br/>
                           <br/>As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#_RefSection_4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate, may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud’s syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonist, the suspected vasospasm reaction should be ruled out before receiving additional rizatriptan benzoate doses.<br/>
                           <br/>Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists have not been clearly established.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Adverse reactions to rizatriptan benzoate were assessed in controlled clinical trials that included over 3700 adult patients who received single or multiple doses of rizatriptan benzoate tablets. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with rizatriptan benzoate (≥5% in either treatment group and greater than placebo) were asthenia/fatigue, somnolence, pain/pressure sensation and dizziness. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related.<br/>
                           <br/>Table 1 lists the adverse reactions (incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo) after a single dose of rizatriptan benzoate in adults. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The Pregnancy Registry for rizatriptan benzoate did not identify any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes over the period of 1998 to 2018. However, the lack of identification of any pattern should be viewed with caution, as the number of prospective reports with outcome information was low and did not provide sufficient power to detect an increased risk of individual birth defects associated with the use of rizatriptan benzoate. Additionally, there was significant loss to follow-up in the prospective pregnancy reports, further complicating this assessment of an association between rizatriptan benzoate and any pattern of congenital anomalies or other adverse birth outcomes. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study using data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register, live births to women who reported using triptans or ergots during pregnancy were compared with those of women who did not. Of the 157 births with first-trimester exposure to rizatriptan, 7 infants were born with malformations (relative risk 1.01 [95% CI: 0.40 to 2.08]). A study using linked data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to the Norwegian Prescription Database compared pregnancy outcomes in women who redeemed prescriptions for triptans during pregnancy, as well as a migraine disease comparison group who redeemed prescriptions for triptans before pregnancy only, compared with a population control group. Of the 310 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan during the first trimester, 10 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.03 [95% CI: 0.55 to 1.93]), while for the 271 women who redeemed prescriptions for rizatriptan before, but not during, pregnancy, 12 had infants with major congenital malformations (OR 1.48 [95% CI: 0.83 to 2.64]), each compared with the population comparison group. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>When rizatriptan (0, 2, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis, a decrease in fetal body weight was observed at the highest doses tested. At the mid dose (10 mg/kg/day), which was a no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development, plasma exposure (AUC) was approximately 15 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day. When rizatriptan (0, 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis, no adverse fetal effects were observed. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the highest dose tested was 115 times that in humans at the MRHD. Placental transfer of drug to the fetus was demonstrated in both species. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of rizatriptan (0, 2, 10, or 100 mg/kg/day) to female rats prior to and during mating and continuing throughout gestation and lactation resulted in reduced body weight in offspring from birth and throughout lactation at all but the lowest dose tested (2 mg/kg/day). Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose (2 mg/kg/day) for adverse effects on postnatal development was similar to that in humans at the MRHD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral administration of rizatriptan (0, 5, 100, or 250 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis and lactation resulted in neonatal mortality, reduced body weight (which persisted into adulthood), and impaired neurobehavioral function in offspring at all but the lowest dose tested. Plasma exposure (AUC) at the no-effect dose for adverse effects on postnatal development (5 mg/kg/day) was approximately 8 times that in humans at the MRHD. </paragraph>

                           <br/>Although the pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan were similar in elderly (aged ≥65 years) and in younger adults (n=17), in general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, starting at the low end of the dosing range.

               <text>
                  <paragraph>No overdoses of rizatriptan benzoate were reported during clinical trials in adults.<br/>
                     <br/>Some adult patients who received 40 mg of rizatriptan benzoate either a single dose or as two doses with a 2-hour interdose interval had dizziness and somnolence.<br/>
                     <br/>In a clinical pharmacology study in which 12 adult subjects received rizatriptan benzoate, at total cumulative doses of 80 mg (given within four hours), two of the subjects experienced syncope, dizziness, bradycardia including third degree AV block, vomiting, and/or incontinence.<br/>
                     <br/> In the long-term, open label study, involving 606 treated pediatric migraineurs 12 to 17 years of age (of which 432 were treated for at least 12 months), 151 patients (25%) took two 10 mg doses of rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets within a 24-hour period. Adverse reactions for 3 of these patients included abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and dyspnea.<br/>
                     <br/> In addition, based on the pharmacology of rizatriptan benzoate, hypertension or myocardial ischemia could occur after overdosage. Gastrointestinal decontamination, (i.e., gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal) should be considered in patients suspected of an overdose with rizatriptan benzoate. Clinical and electrocardiographic monitoring should be continued for at least 12 hours, even if clinical symptoms are not observed.<br/>
                     <br/> The effects of hemo- or peritoneal dialysis on serum concentrations of rizatriptan are unknown.</paragraph>

                           <br/>Rizatriptan is completely absorbed following oral administration. The mean oral absolute bioavailability of the rizatriptan benzoate tablet is about 45%, and mean peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) are reached in approximately 1 to 1.5 hours (T<sub>max</sub>). The presence of a migraine headache did not appear to affect the absorption or pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan. Food has no significant effect on the bioavailability of rizatriptan but delays the time to reach peak concentration by an hour. In clinical trials, rizatriptan benzoate was administered without regard to food.<br/>
                           <br/>The bioavailability and C<sub>max</sub> of rizatriptan were similar following administration of rizatriptan benzoate tablets and rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, but the rate of absorption is somewhat slower with rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, with T<sub>max</sub> delayed by up to 0.7 hour. AUC of rizatriptan is approximately 30% higher in females than in males. No accumulation occurred on multiple dosing.<br/>

                           <br/>
                           <br/>The mean volume of distribution is approximately 140 liters in male subjects and 110 liters in female subjects. Rizatriptan is minimally bound (14%) to plasma proteins.<br/>
                           <br/>

                           <br/>
                           <br/>The primary route of rizatriptan metabolism is via oxidative deamination by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) to the indole acetic acid metabolite, which is not active at the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor. N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan, a metabolite with activity similar to that of parent compound at the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor, is formed to a minor degree. Plasma concentrations of N-monodesmethyl-rizatriptan are approximately 14% of those of parent compound, and it is eliminated at a similar rate. Other minor metabolites, the N-oxide, the 6-hydroxy compound, and the sulfate conjugate of the 6-hydroxy metabolite are not active at the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor.<br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Elimination</content>
                           <br/>
                           <br/>The total radioactivity of the administered dose recovered over 120 hours in urine and feces was 82% and 12%, respectively, following a single 10 mg oral administration of <sup>14</sup>C-rizatriptan. Following oral administration of <sup>14</sup>C-rizatriptan, rizatriptan accounted for about 17% of circulating plasma radioactivity. Approximately 14% of an oral dose is excreted in urine as unchanged rizatriptan while 51% is excreted as indole acetic acid metabolite, indicating substantial first pass metabolism.<br/>
                           <br/>The plasma half-life of rizatriptan in males and females averages 2 to 3 hours.<br/>

                              <content styleCode="underline">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</content>: </content>Rizatriptan is principally metabolized via monoamine oxidase, ‘A’ subtype (MAO-A). Plasma concentrations of rizatriptan may be increased by drugs that are selective MAO-A inhibitors (e.g., moclobemide) or nonselective MAO inhibitors [type A and B] (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and pargyline). In a drug interaction study, when rizatriptan benzoate 10 mg was administered to subjects (n=12) receiving concomitant therapy with the selective, reversible MAO-A inhibitor, moclobemide 150 mg t.i.d., there were mean increases in rizatriptan AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of 119% and 41% respectively; and the AUC of the active N-monodesmethyl metabolite of rizatriptan was increased more than 400%. The interaction would be expected to be greater with irreversible MAO inhibitors. No pharmacokinetic interaction is anticipated in patients receiving selective MAO-B inhibitors <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#_RefSection_4">Contraindications (4)</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#_RefSection_7.5">Drug Interactions (7.5)</linkHtml>]</content>.<br/>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of rizatriptan benzoate tablets was established in four multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Patients enrolled in these studies were primarily female (84%) and Caucasian (88%), with a mean age of 40 years (range of 18 to 71). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction of moderate or severe headache pain to no or mild headache pain, was assessed for up to 2 hours (Study 1) or up to 4 hours after dosing (Studies 2, 3 and 4). Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia and maintenance of response up to 24 hours post-dose were evaluated. A second dose of rizatriptan benzoate tablets was allowed 2 to 24 hours after dosing for treatment of recurrent headache in Studies 1 and 2. Additional analgesics and/or antiemetics were allowed 2 hours after initial treatment for rescue in all four studies.<br/>
                           <br/>In all studies, the percentage of patients achieving headache response 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater in patients who received either rizatriptan benzoate 5 or 10 mg compared to those who received placebo. In a separate study, doses of 2.5 mg were not different from placebo. Doses greater than 10 mg were associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects. The results from the four controlled studies are summarized in Table 2.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials may not be reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.<br/>
                           <br/>The estimated probability of achieving an initial headache response within 2 hours following treatment in pooled Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 is depicted in Figure 1.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial (Study 7). Patients had to have at least a 6-month history of migraine attacks (with or without aura) usually lasting 3 hours or more (when untreated). The patient population was historically non-responsive to NSAIDs and acetaminophen therapy. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were instructed to treat a single migraine attack with headache pain of moderate to severe intensity. The treatment phase of the study had two stages. Stage 1 was used to identify placebo non-responders, who then entered into Stage 2, in which patients were randomized to rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets or placebo. Using a weight-based dosing strategy, patients 20 kg to &lt;40 kg (44 lb to &lt;88 lb) received rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets 5 mg or placebo, and patients ≥40 kg (88 lb) received rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg or placebo. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean age for the studied patient population was 13 years. Sixty-one percent of the patients were Caucasian, and fifty-six percent of the patients were female. The percentage of patients achieving the primary efficacy endpoint of no headache pain at 2 hours after treatment was significantly greater in patients who received rizatriptan benzoate orally disintegrating tablets, compared with those who received placebo (33% vs. 24%). Study 7 results are summarized in Table 4.</paragraph>
