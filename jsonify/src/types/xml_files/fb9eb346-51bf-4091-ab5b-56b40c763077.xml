                     <br/>Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride relieves skeletal muscle spasm of local origin without interfering with muscle function. It is ineffective in muscle spasm due to central nervous system disease.<br/>
                     <br/> Cyclobenzaprine reduced or abolished skeletal muscle hyperactivity in several animal models. Animal studies indicate that cyclobenzaprine does not act at the neuromuscular junction or directly on skeletal muscle. Such studies show that cyclobenzaprine acts primarily within the central nervous system at brain stem as opposed to spinal cord levels, although its action on the latter may contribute to its overall skeletal muscle relaxant activity. Evidence suggests that the net effect of cyclobenzaprine is a reduction of tonic somatic motor activity, influencing both gamma (γ) and alpha (α) motor systems. <br/>
                     <br/> Pharmacological studies in animals showed a similarity between the effects of cyclobenzaprine and the structurally related tricyclic antidepressants, including reserpine antagonism, norepinephrine potentiation, potent peripheral and central anticholinergic effects, and sedation. Cyclobenzaprine caused slight to moderate increase in heart rate in animals. <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Pharmacokinetics<br/>
                        <br/>
                     </content> Estimates of mean oral bioavailability of cyclobenzaprine range from 33% to 55%. Cyclobenzaprine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 2.5 mg to 10 mg, and is subject to enterohepatic circulation. It is highly bound to plasma proteins. Drug accumulates when dosed three times a day, reaching steady-state within 3 to 4 days at plasma concentrations about four-fold higher than after a single dose. At steady state in healthy subjects receiving 10 mg t.i.d. (n=18), peak plasma concentration was 25.9 ng/mL (range, 12.8 to 46.1 ng/mL), and area under the concentration-time (AUC) curve over an 8-hour dosing interval was 177 ng.hr/mL (range, 80 to 319 ng.hr/mL.) <br/>
                     <br/> Cyclobenzaprine is extensively metabolized, and is excreted primarily as glucuronides via the kidney. Cytochromes P450 3A4, 1A2, and, to a lesser extent, 2D6, mediate N-demethylation, one of the oxidative pathways for cyclobenzaprine. Cyclobenzaprine is eliminated quite slowly, with an effective half-life of 18 hours (range 8 to 37 hours; n=18); plasma clearance is 0.7 L/min. <br/>
                     <br/> The plasma concentration of cyclobenzaprine is generally higher in the elderly and in patients with hepatic impairment (see <linkHtml href="#ID_d1686180-225f-4af5-a7f2-1eb201ca2405">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#ID_d1686180-225f-4af5-a7f2-1eb201ca2405">Use in the Elderly </linkHtml>and<linkHtml href="#ID_d1686180-225f-4af5-a7f2-1eb201ca2405"> PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#ID_d1686180-225f-4af5-a7f2-1eb201ca2405">Impaired Hepatic Function</linkHtml>). <br/>

                        <br/>
                     </content> In a pharmacokinetic study in elderly individuals (≥65yrs old), mean (n=10) steady-state cyclobenzaprine AUC values were approximately 1.7 fold (171.0 ng.hr/mL, range 96.1 to 255.3) higher than those seen in a group of 18 younger adults (101.4 ng.hr/mL, range 36.1 to 182.9) from another study. Elderly male subjects had the highest observed mean increase, approximately 2.4 fold (198.3 ng.hr/mL, range 155.6 to 255.3 vs. 83.2 ng.hr/mL, range 41.1 to 142.5 for younger males) while levels in elderly females were increased to a much lesser extent, approximately 1.2 fold (143.8 ng.hr/mL, range 96.1 to 196.3 vs. 115.9 ng.hr/mL, range 36.1 to 182.9 for younger females.) <br/>
                     <br/>In light of these findings, therapy with cyclobenzaprine in the elderly should be initiated with 5 mg dose and titrated slowly upward. <br/>

                        </content>
                     </content> In a pharmacokinetic study of 16 subjects with hepatic impairment (15 mild, 1 moderate per Child-Pugh score), both AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were approximately double the values seen in the healthy control group. Based on the findings, cyclobenzaprine should be used with caution in subjects with mild hepatic impairment starting with the 5 mg dose and titrating slowly upward. Due to the lack of data in subjects with more severe hepatic insufficiency, the use of cyclobenzaprine in subjects with moderate to severe impairment is not recommended. <br/>
                     <br/> No significant effect on plasma levels or bioavailability of cyclobenzaprine or aspirin was noted when single or multiple doses of the two drugs were administered concomitantly. Concomitant administration of cyclobenzaprine and naproxen or diflunisal was well tolerated with no reported unexpected adverse effects. However combination therapy of cyclobenzaprine with naproxen was associated with more side effects than therapy with naproxen alone, primarily in the form of drowsiness. No well-controlled studies have been performed to indicate that cyclobenzaprine enhances the clinical effect of aspirin or other analgesics, or whether analgesics enhance the clinical effect of cyclobenzaprine in acute musculoskeletal conditions.  <content styleCode="bold"/>

                        <br/>Clinical Studies<br/>
                        <br/>
                     </content> Eight double-blind controlled clinical studies were performed in 642 patients comparing cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 10 mg, diazepam, and placebo. Muscle spasm, local pain and tenderness, limitation of motion, and restriction in activities of daily living were evaluated. In three of these studies there was a significantly greater improvement with cyclobenzaprine than with diazepam, while in the other studies the improvement following both treatments was comparable. <br/>
                     <br/> Although the frequency and severity of adverse reactions observed in patients treated with cyclobenzaprine were comparable to those observed in patients treated with diazepam, dry mouth was observed more frequently in patients treated with cyclobenzaprine and dizziness more frequently in those treated with diazepam. The incidence of drowsiness, the most frequent adverse reaction, was similar with both drugs. <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>The efficacy of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 5 mg was demonstrated in two 7-day, double-blind, controlled clinical trials enrolling 1,405 patients. One study compared cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 5 mg and 10 mg t.i.d. to placebo; and a second study compared cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 5 mg and 2.5 mg t.i.d. to placebo. Primary endpoints for both trials were determined by patient-generated data and included global impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting backache. Each endpoint consisted of a score on a 5-point rating scale (from 0 or worst outcome to 4 or best outcome). Secondary endpoints included a physician’s evaluation of the presence and extent of palpable muscle spasm. <br/>
                     <br/> Comparisons of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 5 mg and placebo groups in both trials established the statistically significant superiority of the 5 mg dose for all three primary endpoints at day 8 and, in the study comparing 5 and 10 mg, at day 3 or 4 as well. A similar effect was observed with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 10 mg (all endpoints). Physician-assessed secondary endpoints also showed that cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 5 mg was associated with a greater reduction in palpable muscle spasm than placebo. <br/>
                     <br/> Analysis of the data from controlled studies shows that cyclobenzaprine produces clinical improvement whether or not sedation occurs. <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Surveillance Program <br/>
                        <br/>
                     </content> A postmarketing surveillance program was carried out in 7,607 patients with acute musculoskeletal disorders, and included 297 patients treated with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride 10 mg for 30 days or longer. The overall effectiveness of cyclobenzaprine was similar to that observed in the double-blind controlled studies; the overall incidence of adverse effects was less (see <linkHtml href="#ID_3992a26b-abd6-43d8-921d-bd62d7b45aad">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>).  </paragraph>

                     <br/>
                     <br/>The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride when used in combination with other drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors. The concomitant use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride with MAO inhibitors is contraindicated (see <linkHtml href="#ID_b20793f4-6fc8-437f-bd64-321c3ef485da">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., confusion, agitation, hallucinations), autonomic instability (e.g., diaphoresis, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., tremor, ataxia, hyperreflexia, clonus, muscle rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Treatment with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above reactions occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. If concomitant treatment with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation is advised, particularly during treatment initiation or dose increases (see <linkHtml href="#ID_d1686180-225f-4af5-a7f2-1eb201ca2405">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#ID_d1686180-225f-4af5-a7f2-1eb201ca2405">Drug Interactions</linkHtml>). <br/>
                     <br/>Cyclobenzaprine is closely related to the tricyclic antidepressants, e.g., amitriptyline and imipramine. In short term studies for indications other than muscle spasm associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions, and usually at doses somewhat greater than those recommended for skeletal muscle spasm, some of the more serious central nervous system reactions noted with the tricyclic antidepressants have occurred (see <linkHtml href="#ID_b589a1b0-2fe1-4784-9f0d-7a2e84000f1e">WARNINGS</linkHtml>, below, and <linkHtml href="#ID_3992a26b-abd6-43d8-921d-bd62d7b45aad">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>). <br/>
                     <br/> Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, prolongation of the conduction time leading to myocardial infarction and stroke. <br/>
                     <br/> Cyclobenzaprine may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.   </paragraph>

                     </content> Because of its atropine-like action, cyclobenzaprine should be used with caution in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and in patients taking anticholinergic medication. <br/>

                     </content> The plasma concentration of cyclobenzaprine is increased in patients with hepatic impairment (see<linkHtml href="#ID_78fac471-f66b-4ea2-b817-2a96dab9e24d"> CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#ID_78fac471-f66b-4ea2-b817-2a96dab9e24d">Pharmacokinetics: Hepatic Impairment</linkHtml>). These patients are generally more susceptible to drugs with potentially sedating effects, including cyclobenzaprine. Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be used with caution in subjects with mild hepatic impairment starting with a 5 mg dose and titrating slowly upward. Due to the lack of data in subjects with more severe hepatic insufficiency, the use of cyclobenzaprine in subjects with moderate to severe impairment is not recommended. <br/>

                     </content> Cyclobenzaprine, especially when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants, may impair mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. In the elderly, the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with the use of cyclobenzaprine, with or without concomitant medications, is increased. In elderly patients, cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride should be initiated with a 5 mg dose and titrated slowly upward. <br/>
                     <br/> Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other drugs, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors. Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and be instructed to seek medical care immediately if they experience these symptoms (see <linkHtml href="#ID_b589a1b0-2fe1-4784-9f0d-7a2e84000f1e">WARNINGS</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_d1686180-225f-4af5-a7f2-1eb201ca2405">PRECAUTIONS</linkHtml>: <linkHtml href="#ID_d1686180-225f-4af5-a7f2-1eb201ca2405">Drug Interactions</linkHtml>). <br/>

                     </content> Cyclobenzaprine may have life-threatening interactions with MAO inhibitors (see <linkHtml href="#ID_b20793f4-6fc8-437f-bd64-321c3ef485da">CONTRAINDICATIONS</linkHtml>). Postmarketing cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other drugs, such as SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, tramadol, bupropion, meperidine, verapamil, or MAO inhibitors. If concomitant treatment with cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride and other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, careful observation is advised, particularly during treatment initiation or dose increases (see <linkHtml href="#ID_b589a1b0-2fe1-4784-9f0d-7a2e84000f1e">WARNINGS</linkHtml>). <br/>
                     <br/>
                     <br/>Cyclobenzaprine may enhance the effects of alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants. <br/>
                     <br/> Tricyclic antidepressants may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds. <br/>

                     </content> In rats treated with cyclobenzaprine for up to 67 weeks at doses of approximately 5 to 40 times the maximum recommended human dose, pale, sometimes enlarged, livers were noted and there was a dose-related hepatocyte vacuolation with lipidosis. In the higher dose groups this microscopic change was seen after 26 weeks and even earlier in rats which died prior to 26 weeks; at lower doses, the change was not seen until after 26 weeks. <br/>
                     <br/>Cyclobenzaprine did not affect the onset, incidence or distribution of neoplasia in an 81-week study in the mouse or in a 105-week study in the rat. <br/>
                     <br/> At oral doses of up to 10 times the human dose, cyclobenzaprine did not adversely affect the reproductive performance or fertility of male or female rats. Cyclobenzaprine did not demonstrate mutagenic activity in the male mouse at dose levels of up to 20 times the human dose. <br/>

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.   <br/>

The elderly may also be more at risk for CNS adverse events such as hallucinations and confusion, cardiac events resulting in falls or other sequelae, drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. For these reasons, in the elderly, cyclobenzaprine should be used only if clearly needed. In such patients cyclobenzaprine should be initiated with a 5 mg dose and titrated slowly upward.     </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Pharmacologic similarities among the tricyclic drugs require that certain withdrawal symptoms be considered when cyclobenzaprine is administered, even though they have not been reported to occur with this drug.

                  <paragraph>Although rare, deaths may occur from overdosage with cyclobenzaprine. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate cyclobenzaprine overdose. <content styleCode="bold">As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment.</content> Signs and symptoms of toxicity may develop rapidly after cyclobenzaprine overdose; therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible. The acute oral LD<sub>50</sub> of cyclobenzaprine is approximately 338 and 425 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. <br/>

                        <br/>
                     </content> The most common effects associated with cyclobenzaprine overdose are drowsiness and tachycardia. Less frequent manifestations include tremor, agitation, coma, ataxia, hypertension, slurred speech, confusion, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and hallucinations. Rare but potentially critical manifestations of overdose are cardiac arrest, chest pain, cardiac dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, seizures, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. <br/>
                     <br/> Changes in the electrocardiogram, particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of cyclobenzaprine toxicity. Other potential effects of overdosage include any of the symptoms listed under <linkHtml href="#ID_3992a26b-abd6-43d8-921d-bd62d7b45aad">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>. <br/>

                     <br/>In order to protect against the rare but potentially critical manifestations described above, obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring. Protect the patient’s airway, establish an intravenous line and initiate gastric decontamination. Observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or respiratory depression, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias and/or conduction blocks, and seizures is necessary. If signs of toxicity occur at any time during this period, extended monitoring is required. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide management of the patient. Dialysis is probably of no value because of low plasma concentrations of the drug. <content styleCode="bold">

Serum alkalinization, to a pH of 7.45 to 7.55, using intravenous sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation (as needed), should be instituted for patients with dysrhythmias and/or QRS widening. A pH&gt;7.60 or a pCO<sub>2</sub>&lt;20 mmHg is undesirable. Dysrhythmias unresponsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine, bretylium or phenytoin. Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide). <br/>

Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines or, if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin). Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat life-threatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other therapies, and then only in close consultation with a poison control center. <br/>
