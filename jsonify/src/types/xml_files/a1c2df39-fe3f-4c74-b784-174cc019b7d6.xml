                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Eculizumab products, complement inhibitors, increase a patient's susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by meningococcal bacteria (septicemia and/or meningitis) in any serogroup, including non-groupable strains. Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of BKEMV treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious <content styleCode="italics">Neisseria meningitidis</content> infection.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A, C, W, Y and B) at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of BKEMV, according to current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of therapy with BKEMV. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If urgent BKEMV therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer meningococcal vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including eculizumab products. The benefits and risks of treatment with BKEMV, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by <content styleCode="italics">Neisseria meningitidis</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious meningococcal infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of BKEMV in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection, depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>BKEMV is available only through a restricted program under a REMS <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S5.2">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Meningococcal infections are the most important adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving eculizumab. In PNH clinical studies, two patients experienced meningococcal sepsis. Both patients had previously received a meningococcal vaccine. In clinical studies among patients without PNH, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient. Meningococcal sepsis occurred in one previously vaccinated patient enrolled in the retrospective aHUS study during the post-study follow-up period [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#S5.1">Warnings and Precautions (5.1)</linkHtml>

                              <paragraph>In Study C10-003, 59% (13/22) of patients experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). The most commonly reported SAEs were hypertension (9%), viral gastroenteritis (9%), pyrexia (9%), and upper respiratory infection (9%). One patient discontinued eculizumab due to an adverse event (severe agitation).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Analysis of retrospectively collected adverse event data from pediatric and adult patients enrolled in Study C09-001r (N=30) revealed a safety profile that was similar to that which was observed in the two prospective studies. Study C09-001r included 19 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. Overall, the safety of eculizumab in pediatric patients with aHUS enrolled in Study C09-001r appeared similar to that observed in adult patients. The most common (≥15%) adverse events occurring in pediatric patients are presented in Table 7.</paragraph>

When animal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from before mating until early gestation, no decrease in fertility or reproductive performance was observed. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis, two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose; however, the exposure did not increase fetal loss or neonatal death. When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from implantation through weaning, a higher number of male offspring became moribund or died (1/25 controls, 2/25 low dose group, 5/25 high dose group). Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive function.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Eculizumab-aeeb, the active ingredient in BKEMV, is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Eculizumab products inhibit terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in patients with aHUS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown, but is presumed to involve reduction of terminal complement complex C5b-9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In the placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1), eculizumab when administered as recommended reduced serum LDH levels from 2200 ± 1034 U/L (mean ± SD) at baseline to 700 ± 388 U/L by week one and maintained the effect through the end of the study at week 26 (327 ± 433 U/L) in patients with PNH. In the single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2), the effect was maintained through week 52 [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#S14">Clinical Studies (14)</linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>Following intravenous maintenance doses of 900 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with PNH, the week 26 observed mean ± SD serum eculizumab maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) was 194 ± 76 mcg/mL and the trough concentration (C<sub>trough</sub>) was 97 ± 60 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1,200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with aHUS, the week 26 observed mean ± SD C<sub>trough</sub> was 242 ± 101 mcg/mL. Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1,200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with gMG, the week 26 observed mean ± SD C<sub>max</sub> was 783 ± 288 mcg/mL and the C<sub>trough</sub> was 341 ± 172 mcg/mL.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Steady state was achieved 4 weeks after starting eculizumab treatment, with accumulation ratio of approximately 2-fold in all studied indications. Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that eculizumab pharmacokinetics were dose-linear and time-independent over the 600 mg to 1,200 mg dose range, with inter-individual variability of 21% to 38%.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of eculizumab or of other eculizumab products.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The immunogenicity of eculizumab has been evaluated using two different immunoassays for the detection of anti-eculizumab antibodies: a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Fab fragment of eculizumab as target was used for the PNH indication; and an electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) bridging assay using the eculizumab whole molecule as target was used for the aHUS, and gMG indications, as well as for additional patients with PNH. In the PNH population, antibodies to eculizumab were detected in 3/196 (2%) patients using the ELISA assay and in 5/161 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. In the aHUS population, antibodies to eculizumab were detected in 3/100 (3%) patients using the ECL assay during the entire treatment period. None of the 62 patients with gMG had antibodies to eculizumab detected following the 26-week active treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>An ECL based neutralizing assay with a low sensitivity of 2 mcg/mL was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for the 5 patients with PNH and the 3 patients with aHUS, with anti-eculizumab antibody positive samples using the ECL assay. Two of 161 patients with PNH (1.2%) and 1 of 100 patients with aHUS (1%) had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response was observed</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>PNH patients with at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months, flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10% PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100,000/microliter were randomized to either eculizumab (n = 43) or placebo (n = 44). Prior to randomization, all patients underwent an initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the hemoglobin concentration (the "set-point") which would define each patient's hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The hemoglobin set-point was less than or equal to 9 g/dL in patients with symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g/dL in patients without symptoms. Endpoints related to hemolysis included the numbers of patients achieving hemoglobin stabilization, the number of RBC units transfused, fatigue, and health-related quality of life. To achieve a designation of hemoglobin stabilization, a patient had to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above the hemoglobin set-point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26-week period. Hemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels, and the proportion of PNH RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry. Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at baseline continued these medications.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Patients treated with eculizumab had significantly reduced (p&lt; 0.001) hemolysis resulting in improvements in anemia as indicated by increased hemoglobin stabilization and reduced need for RBC transfusions compared to placebo treated patients (see <linkHtml href="#Tb10">Table 10</linkHtml>). These effects were seen among patients within each of the three pre-study RBC transfusion strata (4 - 14 units; 15 - 25 units; &gt;25 units). After 3 weeks of eculizumab treatment, patients reported less fatigue and improved health-related quality of life. Because of the study sample size and duration, the effects of eculizumab products on thrombotic events could not be determined.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>PNH patients with at least one transfusion in the prior 24 months and at least 30,000 platelets/microliter received eculizumab over a 52-week period. Concomitant medications included anti-thrombotic agents in 63% of the patients and systemic corticosteroids in 40% of the patients. Overall, 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the study (one patient died following a thrombotic event). A reduction in intravascular hemolysis as measured by serum LDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue. One hundred and eighty-seven eculizumab-treated PNH patients were enrolled in a long term extension study. All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total eculizumab exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months. There were fewer thrombotic events with eculizumab treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment. However, the majority of patients received concomitant anticoagulants; the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal during eculizumab products therapy was not studied [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#S5.5">Warnings and Precautions (5.5)</linkHtml>

Patients with aHUS received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of eculizumab or received prophylactic treatment with antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. In all studies, the dose of eculizumab in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks, followed by 1,200 mg 7 ± 2 days later, then 1,200 mg every 14 ± 2 days thereafter. The dosage regimen for pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in Study C09-001r and Study C10-003 was based on body weight [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#S2.3">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</linkHtml>

One patient had no PE/PI the week prior to screening because of PE/PI intolerance. In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count ≤150 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 28 (range: 17 to 68 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08-002A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 70%-121%. Seventy-six percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody.

                              <paragraph>Patients in Study C08-002A/B received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. In Study C08-002A/B, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 100 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 145 weeks).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved and maintained during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (± SD) increased from 23 ± 15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at baseline to 56 ± 40 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> by 26 weeks; this effect was maintained through 2 years (56 ± 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Four of the five patients who required dialysis at baseline were able to discontinue dialysis.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C08-002A/B, mean platelet count (± SD) increased from 109 ± 32 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at baseline to 169 ± 72 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (210 ± 68 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L), and 2 years (205 ± 46 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, two additional patients achieved Hematologic Normalization as well as Complete TMA response. Hematologic Normalization and Complete TMA response were maintained by all responders. In Study C08-002A/B, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Study C08003A/B enrolled patients undergoing chronic PE/PI who generally did- not display hematologic signs of ongoing thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). All patients had received PT at least once every two weeks, but no more than three times per week, for a minimum of eight weeks prior to the first eculizumab dose. Patients on chronic dialysis were permitted to enroll in Study C08-003A/B. The median patient age was 28 years (range: 13 to 63 years). Patients enrolled in Study C08003A/B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed-range of values in the trial were 37%-118%. Seventy percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody.

Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. Platelet counts were maintained at normal levels despite the elimination of PE/PI. The mean platelet count (± SD) was 228 ± 78 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at baseline, 233 ± 69 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at week 26, and 224 ± 52 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at 2 years. When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks, six additional patients achieved Complete TMA response. Complete TMA Response and Hematologic Normalization were maintained by all responders. In Study C08-003A/B, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The efficacy results for the aHUS retrospective study (Study C09-001r) were generally consistent with results of the two prospective studies. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline. Mean platelet count (± SD) increased from 171 ± 83 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at baseline to 233 ±10<sup>9</sup> × 10<sup>9</sup>/L after one week of therapy; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (± SD) at week 26: 254 ± 79 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>A total of 19 pediatric patients (ages 2 months to 17 years) received eculizumab in Study C09-001r. The median duration of eculizumab therapy was 16 weeks (range 4 to 70 weeks) for children &lt; 2 years of age (n=5), 31 weeks (range 19 to 63 weeks) for children 2 to &lt;12 years of age (n=10), and 38 weeks (range 1 to 69 weeks) for patients 12 to &lt; 18 years of age (n=4). Fifty-three percent of pediatric patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Overall, the efficacy results for these pediatric patients appeared consistent with what was observed in patients enrolled in Studies C08-002A/B and C08-003A/B (Table 15). No pediatric patient required new dialysis during treatment with eculizumab.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Study C10-004 enrolled patients who displayed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). In order to qualify for enrollment, patients were required to have a platelet count &lt; lower limit of normal range (LLN), evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH, and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal, without the need for chronic dialysis. The median patient age was 35 (range: 18 to 80 years). All patients enrolled in Study C10-004 were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5%; observed range of values in the trial were 28%-116%. Fifty-one percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto-antibody. A total of 35 patients received PE/PI prior to eculizumab.

                              <paragraph>Patients in Study C10-004 received eculizumab for a minimum of 26 weeks. In Study C10-004, the median duration of eculizumab therapy was approximately 50 weeks (range: 13 weeks to 86 weeks).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Renal function, as measured by eGFR, was improved during eculizumab therapy. The mean eGFR (± SD) increased from 17 ± 12 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at baseline to 47 ± 24 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> by 26 weeks. Twenty of the 24 patients who required dialysis at study baseline were able to discontinue dialysis during eculizumab treatment.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of eculizumab. Eculizumab reduced signs of complement-mediated TMA activity, as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks. In Study C10-004, mean platelet count (± SD) increased from 119 ± 66 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L at baseline to 200 ± 84 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L by one week; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks (mean platelet count (± SD) at week 26: 252 ± 70 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). In Study C10-004, responses to eculizumab were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins or auto-antibodies to factor H.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of eculizumab for the treatment of gMG was established in gMG Study 1 (NCT01997229), a 26-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial that enrolled patients who met the following criteria at screening:</paragraph>
                        <list listType="ordered" styleCode="Arabic">
                           <item>Positive serologic test for anti-AChR antibodies,</item>
                           <item>Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Clinical Classification Class II to IV,</item>
                           <item>MG-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) total score ≥ 6,</item>
                           <item>Failed treatment over 1 year or more with 2 or more immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs) either in combination or as monotherapy, or failed at least 1 IST and required chronic plasmapheresis or plasma exchange (PE) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).</item>
                        </list>
                        <paragraph>A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive eculizumab treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups, including age at diagnosis (38 years in each group), gender [66% female (eculizumab) versus 65% female (placebo)], and duration of gMG [9.9 (eculizumab) versus 9.2 (placebo) years]. Over 95% of patients in each group were receiving acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitors, and 98% were receiving immunosuppressant therapies (ISTs). Approximately 50% of each group had been previously treated with at least 3 ISTs.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Eculizumab was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S2.4">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml>]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary efficacy endpoint for gMG Study 1 was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis-Specific Activities of Daily Living scale (MG-ADL) total score at Week 26. The MG-ADL is a categorical scale that assesses the impact on daily function of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function (total score 0-24). A statistically significant difference favoring eculizumab was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG-ADL total scores [-4.2 points in the eculizumab-treated group compared with -2.3 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.006)].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A key secondary endpoint in gMG Study 1 was the change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) total score at Week 26. The QMG is a 13-item categorical scale assessing muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness (total score 0-39). A statistically significant difference favoring eculizumab was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in QMG total scores [-4.6 points in the eculizumab-treated group compared with -1.6 points in the placebo-treated group (p=0.001)].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The results of the analysis of the MG-ADL and QMG from gMG Study 1 are shown in Table 20.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In gMG Study 1, a clinical response was defined in the MG-ADL total score as at least a 3-point improvement and in QMG total score as at least a 5-point improvement. The proportion of clinical responders at Week 26 with no rescue therapy was statistically significantly higher for eculizumab compared to placebo for both measures. For both endpoints, and also at higher response thresholds (≥ 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-point improvement on MG-ADL, and ≥ 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10-point improvement on QMG), the proportion of clinical responders was consistently greater for eculizumab compared to placebo. Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved by 12 weeks of eculizumab treatment.</paragraph>
