                        <paragraph>Improvement in asthma control following Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI administration can occur within 15 minutes of beginning treatment; although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after starting treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI after 2 weeks of therapy, consider increasing the strength (replace with higher strength) to possibly provide additional improvement in asthma control. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide adequate improvement in asthma control, re-evaluate the therapeutic regimen, including patient compliance and inhaler technique, and consider additional therapeutic options (e.g., increasing the dose of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with a higher strength, adding additional controller therapies).  After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the risk of adverse reactions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Use of LABA as monotherapy [without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)] for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death <content styleCode="italics">[see </content>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)]</content>. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone <content styleCode="italics">[see </content>

                        <paragraph>Four large, 26-week, randomized, blinded, active-controlled clinical safety trials were conducted to evaluate the risk of serious asthma-related events when LABA were used in fixed-dose combination with ICS compared with ICS alone in subjects with asthma. Three (3) trials included adult and adolescent subjects aged 12 years and older: 1 trial compared budesonide/formoterol to budesonide, 1 trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder, and 1 trial compared mometasone furoate/formoterol to mometasone furoate. The fourth trial included pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years and compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder to fluticasone propionate inhalation powder. The primary safety endpoint for all 4 trials was serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death). A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma-related. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The 3 adult and adolescent trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the 3 adult and adolescent trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life‑threatening episodes of asthma. Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma. The initiation of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in this setting is not appropriate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol, a component of this product, has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life‑threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short‑acting beta<sub>2</sub>‑agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function). However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Increasing use of inhaled, short‑acting beta<sub>2</sub>‑agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for replacing the current strength of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI with a higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating systemic corticosteroids. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. An inhaled, short‑acting beta<sub>2</sub>‑agonist, not Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short‑acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice‑daily use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> When beginning treatment with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short‑acting beta<sub>2</sub>‑agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible adolescents or adults using corticosteroids. In such patients who have not had these diseases or who have not been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If a patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated. If a patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline"> </content>Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal (HPA) function.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification warning card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] or morning peak expiratory flow [AM PEF]), beta‑agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since fluticasone propionate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. A relationship between plasma levels of fluticasone propionate and inhibitory effects on stimulated cortisol production has been shown after 4 weeks of treatment with fluticasone propionate inhalation aerosol. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of the possibility of significant systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients who are sensitive to these effects. If such effects occur, Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids, and for management of asthma symptoms.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Salmeterol, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta‑agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.</paragraph>

Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. </paragraph>

Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at baseline and at 48, 108, and 158 weeks. Conclusions about cataracts cannot be drawn from this trial because the high incidence of cataracts at baseline (61% to 71%) resulted in an inadequate number of subjects treated with other fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg who were eligible and available for evaluation of cataracts at the end of the trial (n = 53). The incidence of newly diagnosed glaucoma was 2% with other fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder 500 mcg/50 mcg, 5% with fluticasone propionate, 0% with salmeterol, and 2% with placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In rare cases, patients on inhaled fluticasone propionate, a component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI, may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg‑Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of fluticasone propionate. Cases of serious eosinophilic conditions have also been reported with other inhaled corticosteroids in this clinical setting. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between fluticasone propionate and these underlying conditions has not been established.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no randomized clinical studies of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol MDPI or individual monoproducts, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, in pregnant women. There are clinical considerations with the use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI in pregnant women <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Considerations]</content>. Animal reproduction studies are available with the combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol as well as individual components. In animals, teratogenicity characteristic of corticosteroids, decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal variations, in rats, mice, and rabbits were observed with subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses of fluticasone propionate less than the maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose (MRHDID) on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. However, fluticasone propionate administered via inhalation to rats decreased fetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the MRHDID on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. Oral administration of salmeterol to pregnant rabbits caused teratogenicity characteristic of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation at maternal doses approximately 700 times the MRHDID on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when salmeterol was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No such effects occurred at an oral salmeterol dose approximately 420 times the MRHDID <content styleCode="italics">[see Data]</content>. </paragraph>

In pregnant Dutch rabbits administered salmeterol doses approximately 700 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at maternal oral doses of 1000 mcg/kg/day and higher), fetal toxic effects were observed characteristically resulting from beta‑adrenoceptor stimulation. These included precocious eyelid openings, cleft palate, sternebral fusion, limb and paw flexures, and delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones. No such effects occurred at a salmeterol dose approximately 420 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 600 mcg/kg/day). New Zealand White rabbits were less sensitive since only delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones was seen at a salmeterol dose approximately 7,000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day). </paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI is a multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) for oral inhalation only. It contains fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate, and lactose monohydrate (which may contain milk proteins). The opening of the mouthpiece cover meters 5.5 mg of the formulation from the device reservoir, which contains 55 mcg, 113 mcg, or 232 mcg of fluticasone propionate, and 14 mcg of salmeterol base (equivalent to 20.3 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate). Patient inhalation through the mouthpiece causes the deagglomeration and aerosolization of the drug particles as the formulation moves through the cyclone component of the device. This is followed by dispersion into the airstream. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Under standardized in vitro test conditions, the Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI delivers 49 mcg, 100 mcg, or 202 mcg of fluticasone propionate and 12.75 mcg of salmeterol base (equivalent to 18.5 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate), with lactose from the mouthpiece when tested at a flow rate of 85 L/min for 1.4 seconds.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The amount of drug delivered to the lung will depend on patient factors such as inspiratory flow profiles. In adult subjects (N=50, aged 18 to 45 years) with asthma, mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI  was 108.28 L/min (range: 70.37 to 129.24 L/min). In adolescent subjects (N=50, aged 12 to 17 years) with asthma, mean peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through the Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI was 106.72 L/min (range: 73.64 to 125.51 L/min).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>This product contains both fluticasone propionate and salmeterol. The mechanisms of action described below for the individual components apply to this combination product. These drugs represent 2 different classes of medications (a synthetic corticosteroid and a LABA) that have different effects on clinical, physiologic, and inflammatory indices.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Fluticasone Propionate</content>: Fluticasone propionate is a synthetic trifluorinated corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory activity. Fluticasone propionate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor that is 18 times that of dexamethasone, almost twice that of beclomethasone-17-monopropionate (BMP), the active metabolite of beclomethasone dipropionate, and over 3 times that of budesonide. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in humans are consistent with these results. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of actions on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of asthma.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Salmeterol</content>: Salmeterol is a selective LABA. In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta<sub>2</sub>‑adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta<sub>2</sub>‑adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<sub>1</sub>‑adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<sub>2</sub>‑adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta‑adrenoceptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta<sub>2</sub>‑agonists may have cardiac effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacologic effects of beta<sub>2</sub>‑adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long‑lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub>, from human lung. Salmeterol inhibits histamine‑induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet‑activating factor‑induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route. In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen‑induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels may not predict therapeutic effect. Trials using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate was negligible (&lt;1%), primarily due to incomplete absorption and presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver. In contrast, the majority of the fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung was systemically absorbed.</paragraph>

The trials were dose-ranging trials of the salmeterol component of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI and not designed to provide comparative effectiveness data and should not be interpreted as evidence of superiority/inferiority to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder. The salmeterol doses studied were 6.8 mcg, 13.2 mcg, 26.8 mcg and 57.4 mcg in combination with fluticasone propionate 118 mcg delivered by MDPI (expressed as metered dose). The metered doses for salmeterol (6.8, 13.2, 26.8, 57.4 mcg) used in this study are slightly different from the metered doses for the comparator products (fluticasone/salmeterol inhalation powder) and the Phase 3 investigational products which are the basis of the proposed commercial labeled claim (55, 113, 232 mcg for fluticasone and 14 mcg for salmeterol). The phase 3 and commercial products were optimized to better match the strengths to the comparators. Plasma for pharmacokinetic characterization was obtained at each dosing period. Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate MDPI 118 mcg/13.2 mcg had similar clinical efficacy with lower systemic exposure when compared to the 50 mcg of salmeterol in fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 100 mcg/50 mcg dry powder inhaler (Figure 2).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Supportive evidence of efficacy for Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI compared with placebo was derived from secondary endpoints such as the weekly average of daily trough morning peak expiratory flow and total daily use of rescue medication. The Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) for patients age ≥ 18 years or the pediatric AQLQ (PAQLQ) for patients aged 12-17 were assessed in Trial 1. The responder rate for both measures was defined as an improvement in score of 0.5 or more as threshold. In Trial 1, the responder rate for patients receiving Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI 55 mcg/14 mcg and Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI 113 mcg/14 mcg was 51% and 57%, respectively, compared to 40% for patients receiving placebo, with an odds ratio of 1.53 (95% CI: 0.93, 2.55) and 2.04 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.41), respectively. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Improvements in lung function occurred within 15 minutes of the first dose (15 minutes postdose). Compared to placebo the difference in LS mean change from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> for Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI 55 mcg/14 mcg and 113 mcg/14 mcg was 0.216 and 0.164 L, respectively (unadjusted p-value &lt;0.0001 for both dosages compared with placebo). Refer to Figure 4 below. Maximum improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> generally occurred within 3 hours for Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI 55 mcg/14 mcg and within 6 hours for Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI 113 mcg/14 mcg and improvements were sustained over the 12 hours of testing at weeks 1 and 12 (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Following the initial dose, predose FEV<sub>1</sub> relative to day 1 baseline improved markedly over the first week of treatment and the improvement was sustained over the 12 weeks of treatment in the trial. No diminution in the 12 hour bronchodilator effect was observed with either Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI dose as assessed by FEV<sub>1</sub> following 12 weeks of therapy.</paragraph>

The AQLQ for patients age ≥ 18 years or the PAQLQ for patients aged 12-17 were assessed in Trial 2. The responder rate for both measures was defined as an improvement in score of 0.5 or more as threshold. In Trial 2, the responder rate for patients receiving Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI 113 mcg/14 mcg and Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI 232 mcg/14 mcg was 48% and 41%, respectively, compared to 27% for patients receiving placebo, with an odds ratio of 2.59 (95% CI: 1.56, 4.31) and 1.94 (95% CI: 1.16, 3.23), respectively. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Improvements in lung function occurred within 15 minutes of the first dose (15 minutes postdose). Compared with placebo, for Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI 113 mcg/14 mcg and 232 mcg/14 mcg the difference in LS mean change from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> was 0.160 L and 0.187 L, respectively (unadjusted p-value &lt;0.0001 for both doses compared with placebo). Maximum improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> generally occurred within 3 hours for both Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI dose groups, and improvements were sustained over the 12 hours of testing at weeks 1 and 12 (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Following the initial dose, predose FEV<sub>1</sub> relative to day 1 baseline improved markedly over the first week of treatment and the improvement was sustained over the 12 weeks of treatment in the trial. No diminution in the 12 hour bronchodilator effect was observed with either Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI dose as assessed by FEV<sub>1</sub> following 12 weeks of therapy.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Patients should use Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI at regular intervals as directed. The daily dosage of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI should not exceed 1 inhalation twice a day. Advise patients, if they miss a dose, to take their next dose at the same time they normally do and to not take 2 doses at one time. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief and full benefit may not be achieved until treatment has been administered for 1 to 2 weeks or longer. Patients should not increase the prescribed dosage but should contact their physicians if symptoms do not improve or if the condition worsens. Instruct patients not to stop use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI abruptly. Patients should contact their physicians immediately if they discontinue use of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI.</paragraph>
