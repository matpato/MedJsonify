                        <paragraph>Serious, and sometimes fatal, gastrointestinal perforation occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from 0.3% to 3% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with a history of prior pelvic radiation. Perforation can be complicated by intra-abdominal abscess, fistula formation, and the need for diverting ostomies. The majority of perforations occurred within 50 days of the first dose <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious fistulae (including, tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, biliary, vaginal, renal and bladder sites) occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from &lt; 1% to 1.8% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with cervical cancer. The majority of fistulae occurred within 6 months of the first dose. Patients who develop a gastrointestinal vaginal fistula may also have a bowel obstruction and require surgical intervention, as well as a diverting ostomy. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid Alymsys in patients with ovarian cancer who have evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation, tracheoesophageal fistula or any Grade 4 fistula. Discontinue in patients with fistula formation involving any internal organ.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a controlled clinical study in which bevacizumab was not administered within 28 days of major surgical procedures, the incidence of wound healing complications, including serious and fatal complications, was 15% in patients with mCRC who underwent surgery while receiving bevacizumab and 4% in patients who did not receive bevacizumab. In a controlled clinical study in patients with relapsed or recurrent GBM, the incidence of wound healing events was 5% in patients who received bevacizumab and 0.7% in patients who did not receive bevacizumab <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In patients who experience wound healing complications during Alymsys treatment, withhold Alymsys until adequate wound healing. Withhold for at least 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 28 days following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of bevacizumab products after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Necrotizing fasciitis including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab, usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Bevacizumab products can result in two distinct patterns of bleeding: minor hemorrhage, which is most commonly Grade 1 epistaxis, and serious hemorrhage, which in some cases has been fatal. Severe or fatal hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, CNS hemorrhage, epistaxis, and vaginal bleeding, occurred up to 5-fold more frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3 to 5 hemorrhagic events ranged from 0.4% to 7% in patients receiving bevacizumab <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious or fatal pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 31% of patients with squamous NSCLC and 4% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to none of the patients receiving chemotherapy alone. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Do not administer Alymsys to patients with recent history of hemoptysis of 1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood. Discontinue in patients who develop a Grades 3 to 4 hemorrhage. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or &gt; 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2 - 4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or &gt; 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2 to 4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2 to 4 proteinuria. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Nephrotic syndrome occurred in &lt;1% of patients receiving bevacizumab across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5,805 patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy and 3,713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received bevacizumab. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received bevacizumab. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during Alymsys therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)]. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The incidence of ovarian failure was 34% vs. 2% in premenopausal women receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor. After discontinuing bevacizumab, recovery of ovarian function at all time points during the post-treatment period was demonstrated in 22% of women receiving bevacizumab. Recovery of ovarian function is defined as resumption of menses, a positive serum Î²-HCG pregnancy test, or an FSH level &lt; 30 mIU/mL during the post-treatment period. Long-term effects of bevacizumab products on fertility are unknown.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Alymsys is not indicated for use with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The incidence of Grade â¥ 3 left ventricular dysfunction was 1% in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to 0.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Among patients who received prior anthracycline treatment, the rate of CHF was 4% for patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to 0.6% for patients receiving chemotherapy alone. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In previously untreated patients with a hematological malignancy, the incidence of CHF and decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were increased in patients receiving bevacizumab with anthracycline-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving placebo with the same chemotherapy regimen. The proportion of patients with a decline in LVEF from baseline of â¥ 20% or a decline from baseline of 10% to &lt; 50%, was 10% in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 5% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Time to onset of left-ventricular dysfunction or CHF was 1 to 6 months after the first dose in at least 85% of the patients and was resolved in 62% of the patients who developed CHF in the bevacizumab arm compared to 82% in the placebo arm. Discontinue Alymsys in patients who develop CHF. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety data in Warnings and Precautions and described below reflect exposure to bevacizumab in 4,463 patients including those with mCRC (AVF2107g, E3200), non-squamous NSCLC (E4599), GBM (EORTC 26101), mRCC (BO17705), cervical cancer (GOG-0240), epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (MO22224), or other cancers at the recommended dose and schedule for a median of 6 to 23 doses. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving bevacizumab as a single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies at a rate &gt;10% were epistaxis, headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry skin, hemorrhage, lacrimation disorder, back pain, and exfoliative dermatitis. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Across clinical studies, bevacizumab was discontinued in 8% to 22% of patients because of adverse reactions <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (14)]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 392 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a double-blind, active-controlled study (AVF2107g), which compared bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL to placebo with bolus-IFL in patients with mCRC <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.1)]</content>. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus-IFL, bevacizumab with bolus-IFL, or bevacizumab with fluorouracil and leucovorin. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. All Grades 3 - 4 adverse reactions and selected Grades 1 - 2 adverse reactions (i.e., hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events) were collected in the entire study population. Adverse reactions are presented in Table 2.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 521 patients in an open-label, active-controlled study (E3200) in patients who were previously treated with irinotecan and fluorouracil for initial therapy for mCRC. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to FOLFOX4, bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks prior to FOLFOX4 on Day 1) with FOLFOX4, or bevacizumab alone (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Selected Grades 3 - 5 non-hematologic and Grades 4 to 5 hematologic occurring at a higher incidence (â¥ 2%) in patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone were fatigue (19% vs. 13%), diarrhea (18% vs. 13%), sensory neuropathy (17% vs. 9%), nausea (12% vs. 5%), vomiting (11% vs. 4%), dehydration (10% vs. 5%), hypertension (9% vs. 2%), abdominal pain (8% vs. 5%), hemorrhage (5% vs. 1%), other neurological (5% vs. 3%), ileus (4% vs. 1%) and headache (3% vs. 0%). These data are likely to under-estimate the true adverse reaction rates due to the reporting mechanisms.</paragraph>

Chemotherapy naÃ¯ve patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent nonâsquamous NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21-day cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). After completion or upon discontinuation of chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive bevacizumab continued to receive bevacizumab alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology (mixed cell type tumors only), CNS metastasis, gross hemoptysis (1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood), unstable angina, or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Only Grades 3 - 5 non-hematologic and Grades 4 - 5 hematologic adverse reactions were collected. Grades 3 - 5 non-hematologic and Grades 4 - 5 hematologic adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (â¥ 2%) in patients receiving bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia (27% vs. 17%), fatigue (16% vs. 13%), hypertension (8% vs. 0.7%), infection without neutropenia (7% vs. 3%), venous thromboembolism (5% vs. 3%), febrile neutropenia (5% vs. 2%), pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates (5% vs. 3%), infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (4% vs. 1%), headache (3% vs. 1%) and proteinuria (3% vs. 0%). </paragraph>

Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with lomustine or lomustine alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. In the bevacizumab with lomustine arm, 22% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 10% of patients in the lomustine arm. In patients receiving bevacizumab with lomustine, the adverse reaction profile was similar to that observed in other approved indications. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 179 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a multicenter, open-label study (MO22224) in which patients were randomized (1:1) to bevacizumab with chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone in patients with platinum resistant, recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that recurred within &lt; 6 months from the most recent platinum based therapy <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (14.8)]</content>. Patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. The trial excluded patients with evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Forty percent of patients on the chemotherapy alone arm received bevacizumab alone upon progression. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. </paragraph>

Adverse reactions are presented in Table 6.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and the specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other bevacizumab products may be misleading. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical studies for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor, 0.6% (14/2233) of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bevacizumab antibodies as detected by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. Among these 14 patients, three tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against bevacizumab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The clinical significance of these anti-bevacizumab antibodies is not known.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on findings from animal studies and their mechanism of action <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]</content>, bevacizumab products may cause fetal harm in pregnant women. Limited postmarketing reports describe cases of fetal malformations with use of bevacizumab products in pregnancy; however, these reports are insufficient to determine drug-associated risks. In animal reproduction studies, intravenous administration of bevacizumab to pregnant rabbits every 3 days during organogenesis at doses approximately 1 to 10 times the clinical dose of 10 mg/kg produced fetal resorptions, decreased maternal and fetal weight gain and multiple congenital malformations including corneal opacities and abnormal ossification of the skull and skeleton including limb and phalangeal defects <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. Furthermore, animal models link angiogenesis and VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryofetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. </paragraph>

There were dose-related increases in the number of litters containing fetuses with any type of malformation (42% for the 0 mg/kg dose, 76% for the 30 mg/kg dose, and 95% for the 100 mg/kg dose) or fetal alterations (9% for the 0 mg/kg dose, 15% for the 30 mg/kg dose, and 61% for the 100 mg/kg dose). Skeletal deformities were observed at all dose levels, with some abnormalities including meningocele observed only at the 100 mg/kg dose level. Teratogenic effects included: reduced or irregular ossification in the skull, jaw, spine, ribs, tibia and bones of the paws; fontanel, rib and hindlimb deformities; corneal opacity; and absent hindlimb phalanges. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Bevacizumab products bind VEGF and prevent the interaction of VEGF to its receptors (Flt-1 and KDR) on the surface of endothelial cells. The interaction of VEGF with its receptors leads to endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation in <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> models of angiogenesis. Administration of bevacizumab to xenotransplant models of colon cancer in nude (athymic) mice caused reduction of microvascular growth and inhibition of metastatic disease progression. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic profile of bevacizumab was assessed using an assay that measures total serum bevacizumab concentrations (i.e., the assay did not distinguish between free bevacizumab and bevacizumab bound to VEGF ligand). Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 491 patients who received 1 to 20 mg/kg of bevacizumab every week, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks, bevacizumab pharmacokinetics are linear and the predicted time to reach more than 90% of steady state concentration is 84 days. The accumulation ratio following a dose of 10 mg/kg of bevacizumab once every 2 weeks is 2.8. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Population simulations of bevacizumab exposures provide a median trough concentration of 80.3 mcg/mL on Day 84 (10<sup>th</sup>, 90<sup>th</sup> percentile: 45, 128) following a dose of 5 mg/kg once every two weeks. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) central volume of distribution is 2.9 (22%) L. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean (CV%) clearance is 0.23 (33) L/day. The estimated half-life is 20 days (11 to 50 days).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The clearance of bevacizumab varied by body weight, sex, and tumor burden. After correcting for body weight, males had a higher bevacizumab clearance (0.26 L/day vs. 0.21 L/day) and a larger central volume of distribution (3.2 L vs. 2.7 L) than females. Patients with higher tumor burden (at or above median value of tumor surface area) had a higher bevacizumab clearance (0.25 L/day vs. 0.20 L/day) than patients with tumor burdens below the median. In Study AVF2107g, there was no evidence of lesser efficacy (hazard ratio for overall survival) in males or patients with higher tumor burden treated with bevacizumab as compared to females and patients with low tumor burden. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No studies have been conducted to assess potential of bevacizumab products for carcinogenicity or mutagenicity. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Bevacizumab products may impair fertility. Female cynomolgus monkeys treated with 0.4 to 20 times the recommended human dose of bevacizumab exhibited arrested follicular development or absent corpora lutea, as well as dose-related decreases in ovarian and uterine weights, endometrial proliferation, and the number of menstrual cycles. Following a 4- or 12-week recovery period, there was a trend suggestive of reversibility. After the 12-week recovery period, follicular maturation arrest was no longer observed, but ovarian weights were still moderately decreased. Reduced endometrial proliferation was no longer observed at the 12-week recovery time point; however, decreased uterine weight, absent corpora lutea, and reduced number of menstrual cycles remained evident. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab was evaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled study [AVF2107g (NCT00109070)] in 923 patients with previously untreated mCRC who were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus-IFL (irinotecan 125 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, fluorouracil 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and leucovorin 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> given once weekly for 4 weeks every 6 weeks), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL, or bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with fluorouracil and leucovorin. Enrollment to the bevacizumab with fluorouracil and leucovorin arm was discontinued after enrollment of 110 patients in accordance with the protocol-specified adaptive design. Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 96 weeks. The main outcome measure was overall survival (OS). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 60 years; 60% were male, 79% were White, 57% had an ECOG performance status of 0, 21% had a rectal primary and 28% received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. The dominant site of disease was extra-abdominal in 56% of patients and was the liver in 38% of patients. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The addition of bevacizumab improved survival across subgroups defined by age (&lt; 65 years, â¥65 years) and sex. Results are presented in Table 6 and Figure 1.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study [E3200 (NCT00025337)] in 829 patients who were previously treated with irinotecan and fluorouracil for initial therapy for metastatic disease or as adjuvant therapy. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to FOLFOX4 (Day 1: oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and leucovorin 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> concurrently, then fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> bolus followed by 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuously; Day 2: leucovorin 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, then fluorouracil 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> bolus followed by 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuously; every 2 weeks), bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks prior to FOLFOX4 on Day 1) with FOLFOX4, or bevacizumab alone (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The main outcome measure was OS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The bevacizumab alone arm was closed to accrual after enrollment of 244 of the planned 290 patients following a planned interim analysis by the data monitoring committee based on evidence of decreased survival compared to FOLFOX4 alone. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 61 years; 60% were male, 87% were White, 49% had an ECOG performance status of 0, 26% received prior radiation therapy, and 80% received prior adjuvant chemotherapy, 99% received prior irinotecan with or without fluorouracil for metastatic disease, and 1% received prior irinotecan and fluorouracil as adjuvant therapy. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The addition of bevacizumab to FOLFOX4 resulted in significantly longer survival as compared to FOLFOX4 alone; median OS was 13.0 months vs. 10.8 months [hazard ratio (HR) 0.75 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.89), p-value of 0.001 stratified log-rank test] with clinical benefit seen in subgroups defined by age (&lt; 65 years, â¥65 years) and sex. PFS and ORR based on investigator assessment were higher in patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The activity of bevacizumab with fluorouracil (as bolus or infusion) and leucovorin was evaluated in a single arm study [TRC-0301 (NCT00066846)] enrolling 339 patients with mCRC with disease progression following both irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Seventy-three percent of patients received concurrent bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin. One objective partial response was verified in the first 100 evaluable patients for an ORR of 1% (95% CI: 0%, 5.5%). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in a prospective, randomized, open-label, multinational, controlled study [ML18147 (NCT00700102)] in 820 patients with histologically confirmed mCRC who had progressed on a first-line bevacizumab-containing regimen. Patients were excluded if they progressed within 3 months of initiating first-line chemotherapy and if they received bevacizumab for less than 3 consecutive months in the first-line setting. Patients were randomized (1:1) within 3 months after discontinuing bevacizumab as first-line treatment to receive fluoropyrimidine-irinotecan- or fluoropyrimidine-oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks). The choice of second-line treatment was contingent upon first-line chemotherapy. Second-line treatment was administered until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The main outcome measure was OS. A secondary outcome measure was ORR. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 63 years (21 to 84 years); 64% were male, 52% had an ECOG performance status of 1, 44% had an ECOG performance status of 0, 58% received irinotecan-based therapy as first-line treatment, 55% progressed on first-line treatment within 9 months, and 77% received their last dose of bevacizumab as first-line treatment within 42 days of being randomized. Second-line chemotherapy regimens were generally balanced between each arm. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The addition of bevacizumab to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of OS and PFS. There was no significant difference in ORR. Results are presented in Table 7 and Figure 2.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.2 Lack of Efficacy in Adjuvant Treatment of Colon
Cancer</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Lack of efficacy of bevacizumab as an adjunct to standard chemotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer was determined in two randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical studies. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The first study [BO17920 (NCT00112918)] was conducted in 3451 patients with high-risk stage II and III colon cancer, who had undergone surgery for colon cancer with curative intent. Patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab at a dose equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/week on either a 2-weekly schedule with FOLFOX4 (N=1155) or on a 3-weekly schedule with XELOX (N=1145) or FOLFOX4 alone (N=1151). The main outcome measure was disease free survival (DFS) in patients with stage III colon cancer. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 58 years; 54% were male, 84% were White and 29% were â¥ 65 years. Eighty-three percent had stage III disease.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy did not improve DFS. As compared to FOLFOX4 alone, the proportion of stage III patients with disease recurrence or with death due to disease progression were numerically higher for patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 or with XELOX. The hazard ratios for DFS were 1.17 (95% CI: 0.98,1.39) for bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 alone and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.28) for bevacizumab with XELOX versus FOLFOX4 alone. The hazard ratios for OS were 1.31 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.67) and 1.27 (95% CI: 1, 1.62) for the comparison of bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 versus FOLFOX4 alone and bevacizumab with XELOX versus FOLFOX4 alone, respectively. Similar lack of efficacy for DFS was observed in the Â bevacizumab-containing arms compared to FOLFOX4 alone in the high-risk stage II cohort. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a second study [NSABP-C-08 (NCT00096278)], patients with stage II and III colon cancer who had undergone surgery with curative intent, were randomized to receive either bevacizumab administered at a dose equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/week with mFOLFOX6 (N=1354) or mFOLFOX6 alone (N=1356). The median age was 57 years, 50% were male and 87% White. Seventy-five percent had stage III disease. The main outcome was DFS among stage III patients. The HR for DFS was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.10). OS was not significantly improved with the addition of bevacizumab to mFOLFOX6 [HR 0.96 (95% CI: 0.75,1.22)]. </paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab as first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent nonâsquamous NSCLC was studied in a single, large, randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter study [E4599 (NCT00021060)]. A total of 878 chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent nonâsquamous NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21-day cycles of paclitaxel (200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and carboplatin (AUC 6) with or without bevacizumab 15 mg/kg. After completing or discontinuing chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive bevacizumab continued to receive bevacizumab alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology (mixed cell type tumors only), CNS metastasis, gross hemoptysis (1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood), unstable angina, or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. The main outcome measure was duration of survival. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 63 years; 54% were male, 43% were â¥65 years, and 28% had â¥5% weight loss at study entry. Eleven percent had recurrent disease. Of the 89% with newly diagnosed NSCLC, 12% had Stage IIIB with malignant pleural effusion and 76% had Stage IV disease. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>OS was statistically significantly longer for patients receiving bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Median OS was 12.3 months vs. 10.3 months [HR 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.94), final p-value of 0.013, stratified log-rank test]. Based on investigator assessment which was not independently verified, patients were reported to have longer PFS with bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared to chemotherapy alone. Results are presented in Figure 3.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In an exploratory analysis across patient subgroups, the impact of bevacizumab on OS was less robust in the following subgroups: women [HR 0.99 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.25)], patients â¥65 years [HR 0.91 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.14)] and patients with â¥5% weight loss at study entry [HR 0.96 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.26)]. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC, who had not received prior chemotherapy was studied in another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [BO17704 (NCT00806923)]. A total of 1,043 patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive cisplatin and gemcitabine with placebo, bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg or bevacizumab 15 mg/kg. The main outcome measure was PFS. Secondary outcome measure was OS. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 58 years; 36% were female and 29% were â¥ 65 years. Eight percent had recurrent disease and 77% had Stage IV disease. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>PFS was significantly higher in both bevacizumab-containing arms compared to the placebo arm [HR 0.75 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.91), p-value of 0.0026 for bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg and HR 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68; 0.98), p-value of 0.0301 for bevacizumab 15 mg/kg]. The addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin and gemcitabine failed to demonstrate an improvement in the duration of OS [HR 0.93 (95% CI: 0.78; 1.11), p-value of 0.420 for bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg and HR 1.03 (95% </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized (2:1), open-label study in patients with recurrent GBM (EORTC 26101, NCT01290939). Patients with first progression following radiotherapy and temozolomide were randomized (2:1) to receive bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with lomustine (90 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 6 weeks) or lomustine (110 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 6 weeks) alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by World Health Organization performance status (0 vs. &gt;0), steroid use (yes vs. no), largest tumor diameter (â¤ 40 vs. &gt; 40 mm), and institution. The main outcome measure was OS. Secondary outcome measures were investigator-assessed PFS and ORR per the modified Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria, health related quality of life (HRQoL), cognitive function, and corticosteroid use.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A total of 432 patients were randomized to receive lomustine alone (N=149) or bevacizumab with lomustine (N=283). The median age was 57 years; 24.8% of patients were â¥ 65 years. The majority of patients with were male (61%); 66% had a WHO performance status score &gt; 0; and in 56% the largest tumor diameter was â¤ 40 mm. Approximately 33% of patients randomized to receive lomustine received bevacizumab following documented progression. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No difference in OS (HR 0.91, p -value of 0.4578) was observed between arms; therefore, all secondary outcome measures are descriptive only. PFS was longer in the bevacizumab with lomustine arm [HR 0.52 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.64)] with a median PFS of 4.2 months in the bevacizumab with lomustine arm and 1.5 months in the lomustine arm. Among the 50% of patients receiving corticosteroids at the time of randomization, a higher percentage of patients in the bevacizumab with lomustine arm discontinued corticosteroids (23% vs. 12%). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in patients with previously treated GBM were evaluated in one single arm single center study (NCI 06-C-0064E) and a randomized noncomparative multicenter study [AVF3708g (NCT00345163)]. Response rates in both studies were evaluated based on modified WHO criteria that considered corticosteroid use. In AVF3708g, the response rate was 25.9% (95% CI: 17%, 36.1%) with a median duration of response of 4.2 months (95% CI: 3, 5.7). In Study NCI 06-C-0064E, the response rate was 19.6% (95% CI: 10.9%, 31.3%) with a median duration of response of 3.9 months (95% CI: 2.4, 17.4). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in patients with treatment-naÃ¯ve mRCC in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, international study [BO17705 (NCT00738530)] comparing interferon alfa and bevacizumab versus interferon alfa and placebo. A total of 649 patients who had undergone a nephrectomy were randomized (1:1) to receive either bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks; N = 327) or placebo (every 2 weeks; N = 322) with interferon alfa (9 MIU subcutaneously three times weekly for a maximum of 52 weeks). Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The main outcome measure was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary outcome measures were ORR and OS. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 60 years (18 to 82 years); 70% were male and 96% were White. The study population was characterized by Motzer scores as follows: 28% favorable (0), 56% intermediate (1-2), 8% poor (3 to 5), and 7% missing. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>PFS was statistically significantly prolonged among patients receiving bevacizumab compared to placebo; median PFS was 10.2 months vs. 5.4 months [HR 0.60 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.72), p-value &lt; 0.0001, stratified log-rank test]. Among the 595 patients with measurable disease, ORR was also significantly higher (30% vs. 12%, p-value &lt; 0.0001, stratified CMH test). There was no improvement in OS based on the final analysis conducted after 444 deaths, with a median OS of 23 months in the patients receiving bevacizumab with interferon alfa and 21 months in patients receiving interferon alone [HR 0.86, (95% CI: 0.72, 1.04)].

                        <paragraph>Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable adverse reactions. The main outcome measure was OS. Secondary outcome measures included ORR. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 48 years (20 to 85 years). Of the 452 patients randomized at baseline, 78% of patients were White, 80% had received prior radiation, 74% had received prior chemotherapy concurrent with radiation, and 32% had a platinum-free interval of less than 6 months. Patients had a GOG performance status of 0 (58%) or 1 (42%). Demographic and disease characteristics were balanced across arms. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab were evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, randomized study [MO22224 (NCT00976911)] comparing bevacizumab with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that recurred within &lt;6 months from the most recent platinum-based therapy (N=361). Patients had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Patients received one of the following chemotherapy regimens at the discretion of the investigator: paclitaxel (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 every 4 weeks; pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 every 4 weeks; or topotecan 4 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks or 1.25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 - 5 every 3 weeks). Patients were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. Forty percent of patients on the chemotherapy alone arm received bevacizumab alone upon progression. The main outcome measure was investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary outcome measures were ORR and OS. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The median age was 61 years (25 to 84 years) and 37% of patients were â¥65 years. Seventy-nine percent had measurable disease at baseline, 87% had baseline CA-125 levels â¥2 times ULN and 31% had ascites at baseline. Seventy-three percent had a platinum-free interval (PFI) of 3 months to 6 months and 27% had PFI of &lt;3 months. ECOG performance status was 0 for 59%, 1 for 34% and 2 for 7% of the patients. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in investigator-assessed PFS, which was supported by a retrospective independent review analysis. Results for the ITT population are presented in Table 10 and Figure 6. Results for the separate chemotherapy cohorts are presented in Table 11.</paragraph>
