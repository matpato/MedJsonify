                        <paragraph>Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of ramelteon tablets. Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis. Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department. If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with ramelteon tablets should not be rechallenged with the drug.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A variety of cognitive and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of hypnotics. In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression (including suicidal ideation and completed suicides) has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hallucinations, as well as behavioral changes such as bizarre behavior, agitation and mania have been reported with ramelteon tablets use. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may also occur unpredictably.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Complex behaviors such as "sleep-driving" (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic) and other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex), with amnesia for the event, have been reported in association with hypnotic use. The use of alcohol and other CNS depressants may increase the risk of such behaviors. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. Complex behaviors have been reported with the use of ramelteon tablets. Discontinuation of ramelteon tablets should be strongly considered for patients who report any complex sleep behavior. </paragraph>

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from postmarketing reports with ramelteon tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal studies, ramelteon produced evidence of developmental toxicity, including teratogenic effects, in rats at doses greater than 36 times the recommended human dose (RHD) of 8 mg/day based on body surface area (mg/m

                        <paragraph>Oral administration of ramelteon (10, 40, 150 or 600 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities (malformations and variations) at doses greater than 40 mg/kg/day. The no-effect dose is approximately 50 times the RHD based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>. Treatment of pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity at oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (or up to 720 times the RHD based on mg/m

The no-effect dose is 36 times the RHD based on mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>. Increased incidences of malformation and death among offspring were seen at the highest dose.

                        <paragraph>There are no data regarding the presence of ramelteon or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ramelteon and/or its metabolites are present in rat milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the mechanism of action of ramelteon, there is a potential risk for somnolence in a breastfed infant
 
  <content styleCode="italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</content>. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ramelteon tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ramelteon tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

                        <paragraph>Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT
 
  <sub>1</sub>and MT
 
  <sub>2</sub>receptors and relative selectivity over the MT
 
  <sub>3</sub>receptor.

                        <paragraph>The activity of ramelteon at the MT
 
  <sub>1</sub>and MT
 
  <sub>2</sub>receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep-promoting properties, as these receptors, acted upon by endogenous melatonin, are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep-wake cycle.

 </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for receptors that bind neuropeptides, cytokines, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, and opiates.  Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The major metabolite of ramelteon, M-II, is pharmacologically active and has approximately one tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT
 
  <sub>1</sub>and MT
 
  <sub>2</sub>receptors, respectively. However, M-II circulates at higher concentrations than the parent producing 20- to 100-fold greater mean systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon. Similar to ramelteon, M-II does not interfere with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes.

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic profile of ramelteon tablets has been evaluated in healthy subjects as well as in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment. When administered orally to humans in doses ranging from 4 to 64 mg, ramelteon undergoes rapid, high first-pass metabolism, and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics. Maximal serum concentration (C
 
  <sub>max</sub>) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) data show substantial intersubject variability, consistent with the high first-pass effect; the coefficient of variation for these values is approximately 100%. Several metabolites have been identified in human serum and urine.

                        <paragraph>Ramelteon is absorbed rapidly, with median peak concentrations occurring at approximately 0.75 hour (range, 0.5 to 1.5 hours) after fasted oral administration. Although the total absorption of ramelteon is at least 84%, the absolute oral bioavailability is only 1.8% due to extensive first-pass metabolism.</paragraph>

Binding to albumin accounts for most of that binding, since 70% of the drug is bound in human serum albumin. Ramelteon is not distributed selectively to red blood cells. Ramelteon has a mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of 73.6 L, suggesting substantial tissue distribution.

                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ramelteon tablets were studied after administering a 16 mg dose to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment based on predose creatinine clearance (53 to 95, 35 to 49, or 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  <sup>2</sup>, respectively), and in subjects who required chronic hemodialysis. Wide intersubject variability was seen in ramelteon tablets exposure parameters. However, no effects on C
 
  <sub>max</sub>or AUC
 
  <sub>0-t</sub>of parent drug or M-II were seen in any of the treatment groups; the incidence of adverse events was similar across groups. These results are consistent with the negligible renal clearance of ramelteon, which is principally eliminated via hepatic metabolism. No adjustment of ramelteon tablets dosage are required in patients with renal impairment, including patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m
 
  <sup>2</sup>) and patients who require chronic hemodialysis.

No additive effect was seen on the Delayed Word Recognition Test. Because alcohol by itself impairs performance, and the intended effect of ramelteon tablets is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon tablets. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Three randomized, double-blind trials in subjects with chronic insomnia employing polysomnography (PSG) were provided as objective support of ramelteon tablet’s effectiveness in sleep initiation.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>One study enrolled younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive) with chronic insomnia and employed a parallel design in which the subjects received a single, nightly dose of ramelteon tablet (8 or 16 mg) or matching placebo for 35 days. PSG was performed on the first two nights in each of Weeks 1, 3, and 5 of treatment. Ramelteon tablets reduced the average latency to persistent sleep at each of the time points when compared to placebo. The 16 mg dose conferred no additional benefit for sleep initiation.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The second study employing PSG was a three-period crossover trial performed in subjects aged 65 years and older with a history of chronic insomnia. Subjects received ramelteon tablets (4 or 8 mg) or placebo and underwent PSG assessment in a sleep laboratory for two consecutive nights in each of the three study periods. Both doses of ramelteon tablets reduced latency to persistent sleep when compared to placebo. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The third study evaluated long-term efficacy and safety in adults with chronic insomnia. Subjects received a single, nightly dose of ramelteon tablets 8 mg or matching placebo for six months. PSG was performed on the first two nights of Week 1 and Months 1, 3, 5, and 6. Ramelteon tablets reduced sleep latency at each time point when compared to placebo. In this study, when the PSG results from nights 1 and 2 of Month 7 were compared to the results from nights 22 and 23 of Month 6, there was a statistically significant increase in LPS of 33% (9.5 minutes) in the ramelteon group. There was no increase in LPS in the placebo group when the same time periods were compared.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>A randomized, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted in outpatients aged 65 years and older with chronic insomnia and employed subjective measures of efficacy (sleep diaries). Subjects received Ramelteon tablets (4 or 8 mg) or placebo for 35 nights. Ramelteon tablets reduced patient-reported sleep latency compared to placebo. A similarly designed study performed in younger adults (aged 18 to 64 years) using 8 and 16 mg of ramelteon did not replicate this finding of reduced patient-reported sleep latency compared to placebo.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>While the 16 mg dose was evaluated as a potential treatment for adults, it was shown to confer no additional benefit for sleep initiation and was associated with higher incidences of fatigue, headache and next-day somnolence.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A human laboratory abuse potential study was performed in 14 subjects with a history of sedative/hypnotic or anxiolytic drug abuse. Subjects received single oral doses of ramelteon tablets (16, 80, or 160 mg), triazolam (0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 mg) or placebo. All subjects received each of the seven treatments separated by a wash-out period and underwent multiple standard tests of abuse potential. No differences in subjective responses indicative of abuse potential were found between ramelteon tablets and placebo at doses up to 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose. The positive control drug, triazolam, consistently showed a dose-response effect on these subjective measures, as demonstrated by the differences from placebo in peak effect and overall 24 hour effect.

                        <paragraph>In order to evaluate potential next-day residual effects, the following scales were used: a Memory Recall Test, a Word List Memory Test, a Visual Analog Mood and Feeling Scale, the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test, and a post sleep questionnaire to assess alertness and ability to concentrate. There was no evidence of next-day residual effect seen after two nights of ramelteon use during the crossover studies.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a 35 night, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adults with chronic insomnia, measures of residual effects were performed at three time points. Overall, the magnitudes of any observed differences were small. At Week 1, patients who received 8 mg of ramelteon tablets had a mean VAS score (46 mm on a 100 mm scale) indicating more fatigue in comparison to patients who received placebo (42 mm). At Week 3, patients who received 8 mg of ramelteon tablet had a lower mean score for immediate recall (7.5 out of 16 words) compared to patients who received placebo (8.2 words); and the patients treated with ramelteon tablet had a mean VAS score indicating more sluggishness (27 mm on a 100 mm VAS) in comparison to the placebo-treated patients (22 mm). Patients who received ramelteon tablet did not have next-morning residual effects that were different from placebo at Week 5.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Rebound insomnia was assessed in the 35 day studies by measuring sleep latency after abrupt treatment discontinuation. One of these studies employed PSG in younger adult subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 8 or 16 mg; the other two studies employed subjective measures of sleep-onset insomnia in elderly subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 4 or 8 mg, and in younger adult subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 8 or 16 mg. There was no evidence that ramelteon tablets caused rebound insomnia during the posttreatment period.</paragraph>

                     <title>14.3 Studies to Evaluate Effects on Endocrine Function</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Two controlled studies evaluated the effects of ramelteon tablets on endocrine function.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In the first trial, ramelteon tablets 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 99 healthy volunteer subjects for four weeks. This study evaluated the thyroid axis, adrenal axis and reproductive axis. No clinically significant endocrinopathies were demonstrated in this study. However, the study was limited in its ability to detect such abnormalities due to its limited duration. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In the second trial, ramelteon tablets 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 122 subjects with chronic insomnia for six months. This study evaluated the thyroid axis, adrenal axis and reproductive axis. There were no significant abnormalities seen in either the thyroid or the adrenal axes. Abnormalities were, however, noted within the reproductive axis. Overall, the mean serum prolactin level change from baseline was 4.9 mcg/L (34% increase) for women in the ramelteon tablets group compared with -0.6 mcg/L (4% decrease) for women in the placebo group (p=0.003). No differences between active- and placebo-treated groups occurred among men. Thirty two percent of all patients who were treated with ramelteon in this study (women and men) had prolactin levels that increased from normal baseline levels compared to 19% of patients who were treated with placebo. Subject-reported menstrual patterns were similar between the two treatment groups.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In a 12 month, open-label study in adult and elderly patients, there were two patients who were noted to have abnormal morning cortisol levels, and subsequent abnormal ACTH stimulation tests.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>A 29 year old female patient was diagnosed with a prolactinoma. The relationship of these events to ramelteon tablets therapy is not clear.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sleep medication and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event. If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since "sleep-driving" can be dangerous. This behavior is more likely to occur when sleep medications are taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sleep medication. As with sleep-driving, patients usually do not remember these events.</paragraph>
