                        <paragraph>The recommended dosage of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection for the repletion treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients is 10 mL of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (125 mg of elemental iron). Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection may be diluted in 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride administered by intravenous infusion over 1 hour per dialysis session. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection may also be administered undiluted as a slow intravenous injection (at a rate of up to 12.5 mg/min) per dialysis session. For repletion treatment most patients may require a cumulative dose of 1000 mg of elemental iron administered over 8 dialysis sessions. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection has been administered at sequential dialysis sessions by infusion or by slow intravenous injection during the dialysis session itself. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data from sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection postmarketing spontaneous reports indicate that individual doses exceeding 125 mg may be associated with a higher incidence and/or severity of adverse events [see <content styleCode="italics">Adverse Reactions</content>

Among 1,097 patients who received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection in this study, there were 9 patients (0.8%) who had an adverse reaction that, in the view of the investigator, precluded further sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration. These included one life-threatening reaction, six allergic reactions (including pruritus, facial flushing, chills, dyspnea/chest pain, and rash), and two other reactions (hypotension and nausea). Another 2 patients experienced (0.2%) allergic reactions not deemed to represent drug intolerance (nausea/malaise and nausea/dizziness) following sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In the single-dose, postmarketing, safety study, 11% of patients who received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection and 9.4% of patients who received placebo reported adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions following sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration were: hypotension (2%), nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea (2%), pain (0.7%), hypertension (0.6%), allergic reaction (0.5%), chest pain (0.5%), pruritus (0.5%), and back pain (0.4%). The following additional events were reported in two or more patients: hypertonia, nervousness, dry mouth, and hemorrhage. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the multiple-dose, open-label surveillance study, 28% of the patients received concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy. The incidences of both drug intolerance and suspected allergic events following first dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration were 1.6% in patients with concomitant ACEI use compared to 0.7% in patients without concomitant ACEI use. The patient with a life-threatening event was not on ACEI therapy. One patient had facial flushing immediately on sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection exposure. No hypotension occurred and the event resolved rapidly and spontaneously without intervention other than drug withdrawal.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following additional adverse reactions have been identified with the use of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection from postmarketing spontaneous reports:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cardiovascular System: shock, fetal bradycardia, injection site superficial thrombophlebitis, phlebitis, acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction or with in-stent thrombosis in the context of a hypersensitivity reaction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Gastrointestinal System: dysgeusia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Immune System: anaphylactic-type reactions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Nervous System: loss of consciousness, generalized convulsion, hypoesthesia.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Skin and Appendages: skin discoloration, pallor.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Individual doses exceeding 125 mg may be associated with a higher incidence and/or severity of adverse events based on information from postmarketing spontaneous reports. These adverse events included hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspnea, urticaria, chest pain, paresthesia, and peripheral swelling.</paragraph>

Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Available data from postmarketing reports with sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection use in pregnancy are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects and miscarriage.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low-birth-weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see<content styleCode="italics"> Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_596fa422-ed18-4606-8335-c3d661e482ac">5.4</linkHtml>) </content>and<content styleCode="italics"> Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2de9de63-7015-4729-94e1-92c1738623fa">8.4</linkHtml>)</content>].

                        <paragraph>Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection contains benzyl alcohol. Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman, benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely. However, adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low-birth-weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol-containing drugs [see<content styleCode="italics"> Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_596fa422-ed18-4606-8335-c3d661e482ac">5.4</linkHtml>) </content>and<content styleCode="italics"> Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2de9de63-7015-4729-94e1-92c1738623fa">8.4</linkHtml>)</content>].Consider alternative iron replacement therapies without benzyl alcohol for use during lactation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the "gasping syndrome" occurred in premature neonates and low-birth-weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative. In these cases, benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Benzyl alcohol contained in sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection may cause serious and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old. The administration of medications containing benzyl alcohol to newborns or premature neonates has been associated with a fatal "gasping syndrome" (symptoms include a striking onset of gasping syndrome, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse). Preterm, low-birth-weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they could be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection contains 9 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) [see<content styleCode="italics"> Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_596fa422-ed18-4606-8335-c3d661e482ac">5.4</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Multiple sequential single-dose intravenous pharmacokinetic studies were performed on 14 healthy iron-deficient volunteers. Entry criteria included hemoglobin ≥10.5 gm/dL and transferrin saturation ≤15% (TSAT) or serum ferritin value ≤20 ng/mL. In the first stage, each subject was randomized 1:1 to undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection of either 125 mg/hr or 62.5 mg/0.5 hr (2.1 mg/min). Five days after the first stage, each subject was re-randomized 1:1 to undiluted sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection of either 125 mg/7 min or 62.5 mg/4 min (&gt;15.5 mg/min). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Peak drug levels (C<sub>max</sub>) varied significantly by dosage and by rate of administration with the highest C<sub>max</sub> observed in the regimen in which 125 mg was administered in 7 minutes (19.0 mg/L). The terminal elimination half-life for drug bound iron was approximately 1 hour. Half-life varied by dose but not by rate of administration. Half-life values were 0.85 and 1.45 hours for the 62.5 mg/4 min and 125 mg/7 min regimens, respectively. Total clearance of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was 3.02 to 5.35 L/h. The AUC for sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection bound iron varied by dose from 17.5 mg-h/L (62.5 mg) to 35.6 mg-h/L (125 mg). Approximately 80% of drug bound iron was delivered to transferrin as a mononuclear ionic iron species within 24 hours of administration in each dosage regimen. Direct movement of iron from sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection to transferrin was not observed. Mean peak transferrin saturation returned to near baseline by 40 hours after administration of each dosage regimen. </paragraph>

                     <content styleCode="underline">Study A</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study A was a three-center, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two doses of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administered intravenously to iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. The study included both a dose-response concurrent control and an historical control. Enrolled patients received a test dose of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection (25 mg of elemental iron) and were then randomly assigned to receive sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection at cumulative doses of either 500 mg (low dose) or 1000 mg (high dose) of elemental iron. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection was given to both dose groups in eight divided doses during sequential dialysis sessions (a period of 16 to 17 days). At each dialysis session, patients in the low-dose group received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection 62.5 mg of elemental iron over 30 minutes, and those in the high-dose group received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection 125 mg of elemental iron over 60 minutes. The primary endpoint was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 40. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Eligibility for this study included chronic hemodialysis patients with a hemoglobin below 10 g/dL (or hematocrit at or below 32%) and either serum ferritin below 100 ng/mL or transferrin saturation below 18%. Exclusion criteria included significant underlying disease or inflammatory conditions or an epoetin requirement of greater than 10,000 units three times per week. Parenteral iron and red cell transfusion were not allowed for two months before the study. Oral iron and red cell transfusion were not allowed during the study for sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The historical control population consisted of 25 chronic hemodialysis patients who received only oral iron supplementation for 14 months and did not receive red cell transfusion. All patients had stable epoetin doses and hematocrit values for at least two months before initiation of oral iron therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The evaluated population consisted of 39 patients in the low-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group (50% female, 50% male; 74% white, 18% black, 5% Hispanic, 3% Asian; mean age 54 years, range 22-83 years), 44 patients in the high-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group (50% female, 48% male, 2% unknown; 75% white, 11% black, 5% Hispanic, 7% other, 2% unknown; mean age 56 years, range 20-87 years), and 25 historical control patients (68% female, 32% male; 40% white, 32% black, 20% Hispanic, 4% Asian, 4% unknown; mean age 52 years, range 25-84 years). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mean baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit were similar between treatment and historical control patients: 9.8 g/dL and 29% and 9.6 g/dL and 29% in low- and high-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients, respectively, and 9.4 g/dL and 29% in historical control patients. Baseline serum transferrin saturation was 20% in the low-dose group, 16% in the high-dose group, and 14% in the historical control. Baseline serum ferritin was 106 ng/mL in the low-dose group, 88 ng/mL in the high-dose group, and 606 ng/mL in the historical control.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients in the high-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group achieved significantly higher increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit than patients in the low-dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection group. See Table 1.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Study B was a single-center, non-randomized, open-label, historically controlled, study of the safety and efficacy of variable, cumulative doses of intravenous sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection in iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration was identical to Study A. The primary efficacy variable was the change in hemoglobin from baseline to the last available observation through Day 50. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical to those of Study A as was the historical control population. Sixty-three patients were evaluated in this study: 38 in the sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated group (37% female, 63% male; 95% white, 5% Asian; mean age 56 years, range 22-84 years) and 25 in the historical control group (68% female, 32% male; 40% white, 32% black, 20% Hispanic, 4% Asian, 4% unknown; mean age 52 years, range 25-84 years).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients were considered to have completed the study per protocol if they received at least eight sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection doses of either 62.5 mg or 125 mg of elemental iron. A total of 14 patients (37%) completed the study per protocol. Twelve (32%) sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection-treated patients received less than eight doses, and 12 (32%) patients had incomplete information on the sequence of dosing. Not all patients received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection at consecutive dialysis sessions and many received oral iron during the study.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Study C was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of two sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection dose regimens (1.5 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg of elemental iron) administered intravenously to 66 iron-deficient (transferrin saturation &lt;20% and/or serum ferritin &lt;100 ng/mL) pediatric hemodialysis patients, 6 to 15 years of age, inclusive who were receiving a stable erythropoietin dosing regimen. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 125 mg of elemental iron) in 25 mL 0.9% sodium chloride was infused intravenously over 1 hour during each hemodialysis session for eight sequential dialysis sessions. Thirty-two patients received the 1.5 mg/kg dosing regimen (47% male, 53% female; 66% Caucasian, 25% Hispanic, and 3% Black, Asian, or Other; mean age 12.3 years). Thirty-four patients received the 3.0 mg/kg dosing regimen (56% male, 44% female; 77% Caucasian, 12% Hispanic, 9% Black, and 3% Other; mean age 12.0 years).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the change in hemoglobin concentration from baseline to 2 weeks after last sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups. Improvements in hematocrit, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and reticulocyte hemoglobin concentrations compared to baseline values were observed 2 weeks after the last sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection infusion in both the 1.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg treatment groups (Table 3).</paragraph>
