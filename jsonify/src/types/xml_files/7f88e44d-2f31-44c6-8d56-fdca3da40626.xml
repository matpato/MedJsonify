                  <paragraph>Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that exerts anxiolytic, sedative, muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant and amnestic effects. Most of these effects are thought to result from a facilitation of the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. </paragraph>

Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in an average decrease in C<sub>max </sub>of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins (diazepam 98%). Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to &gt; 3 hours. </paragraph>

The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged. </paragraph>

In both premature and full term infants the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam shows evidence of continued accumulation compared to children. Longer half-lives in infants may be due to incomplete maturation of metabolic pathways. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Elimination half-life increases by approximately 1 hour for each year of age beginning with a half-life of 20 hours at 20 years of age. This appears to be due to an increase in volume of distribution with age and a decrease in clearance. Consequently, the elderly may have lower peak concentrations, and on multiple dosing higher trough concentrations. It will also take longer to reach steady-state. Conflicting information has been published on changes of plasma protein binding in the elderly. Reported changes in free drug may be due to significant decreases in plasma proteins due to causes other than simply aging. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of benzodiazepiones, including diazepam tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe diazepam tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of diazepam tablets than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking diazepam tablets, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when diazepam tablets are used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see <linkHtml href="#ID_eea8702c-a2b0-4fd3-bd2d-692b7650cd6c">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see <linkHtml href="#ID_8bf72bdf-7682-47a1-944e-6c4540fe7c9c">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Before prescribing diazepam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of diazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of diazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>If diazepam tablets are to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed - particularly with known compounds that may potentiate the action of diazepam, such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors and other antidepressants (see <linkHtml href="#ID_eea8702c-a2b0-4fd3-bd2d-692b7650cd6c">Drug Interactions</linkHtml>). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The usual precautions are indicated for severely depressed patients or those in whom there is any evidence of latent depression or anxiety associated with depression, particularly the recognition that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Psychiatric and paradoxical reactions are known to occur when using benzodiazepines (see <linkHtml href="#ID_1ceb2f65-6f65-436a-a98e-757112688852">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>). Should this occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. These reactions are more likely to occur in children and the elderly. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A lower dose is recommended for patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, due to the risk of respiratory depression. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Benzodiazepines should be used with extreme caution in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse (see <linkHtml href="#ID_1a386149-f3d6-4f88-a24c-8dd404b23347">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</linkHtml>). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In debilitated patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once or twice daily, initially, to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). Some loss of response to the effects of benzodiazepines may develop after repeated use of diazepam tablets for a prolonged time. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA<sub>A</sub> sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Diazepam peak concentrations are 30% lower when antacids are administered concurrently. However, there is no effect on the extent of absorption. The lower peak concentrations appear due to a slower rate of absorption, with the time required to achieve peak concentrations on average 20-25 minutes greater in the presence of antacids. However, this difference was not statistically significant. </paragraph>

                              <paragraph>There is a potentially relevant interaction between diazepam and compounds which inhibit certain hepatic enzymes (particularly cytochrome P450 3A and 2C19). Data indicate that these compounds influence the pharmacokinetics of diazepam and may lead to increased and prolonged sedation. At present, this reaction is known to occur with cimetidine, ketoconazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and omeprazole.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Diazepam tablets are a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders (see <linkHtml href="#ID_e138f3c9-b3e0-4e64-a2d2-4be5e7a7ed70">WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Diazepam tablets may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses), those who have had longer durations of use (see <linkHtml href="#ID_0bc75cd9-52b9-4f1a-908f-22888d4ead87">WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions</linkHtml>).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (see <linkHtml href="#ID_0c762088-b24a-4df5-a405-73be2bffb872">DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Diazepam Tablets</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#ID_0bc75cd9-52b9-4f1a-908f-22888d4ead87">WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions</linkHtml>). </paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Protracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tolerance to diazepam tablets may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of diazepam tablets may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines. </paragraph>

               <title>OVERDOSAGE </title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal (see <linkHtml href="#ID_0bc75cd9-52b9-4f1a-908f-22888d4ead87">WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions</linkHtml>). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.</paragraph>
