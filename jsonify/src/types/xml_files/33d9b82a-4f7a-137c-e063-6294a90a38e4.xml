                        <paragraph>SIMPONI ARIA solution for intravenous infusion should be diluted by a healthcare professional using aseptic technique as follows:</paragraph>
                        <list listType="ordered">
                           <item>Calculate the dosage and the number of SIMPONI ARIA vials needed based on the recommended adult dosage of 2 mg/kg and the patient's weight for RA, PsA and AS. Calculate the dosage and number of SIMPONI ARIA vials needed based on the recommended pediatric dosage of 80 mg/m
  
   <sup>2</sup>and the patient's body surface area (BSA), for pJIA and pediatric patients with PsA. Each 4 mL vial of SIMPONI ARIA contains 50 mg of golimumab.
 
  </item>
                           <item>Check that the solution in each vial is colorless to light yellow. The solution may develop a few fine translucent particles, as golimumab is a protein. Do not use if opaque particles, discoloration, or other foreign particles are present.</item>
                           <item>Dilute the total volume of the SIMPONI ARIA solution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to a final volume of 100 mL. For example, this can be accomplished by withdrawing a volume of the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP from the 100-mL infusion bag or bottle equal to the total volume of SIMPONI ARIA. Slowly add the total volume of SIMPONI ARIA solution to the 100-mL infusion bag or bottle. Gently mix. Discard any unused solution remaining in the vials. Alternatively, SIMPONI ARIA can be diluted using the same method described above with 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.</item>
                           <item>Prior to infusion, visually inspect the diluted SIMPONI ARIA solution for particulate matter or discoloration. Do not use if these are present.</item>
                           <item>Use only an infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding filter (pore size 0.22 micrometer or less).</item>
                           <item>Do not infuse SIMPONI ARIA concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. No physical biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the use of SIMPONI ARIA with other intravenous agents in the same intravenous line.</item>
                           <item>Infuse the diluted solution over 30 minutes.</item>
                           <item>Once diluted, the infusion solution can be stored for up to 4 hours at room temperature.</item>

                        <paragraph>Patients treated with SIMPONI ARIA are at increased risk for developing serious infections involving various organ systems and sites that may lead to hospitalization or death.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Opportunistic infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or parasitic organisms including aspergillosis, blastomycosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, pneumocystosis, and tuberculosis have been reported with TNF-blockers. Patients have frequently presented with disseminated rather than localized disease. The concomitant use of a TNF-blocker and abatacept or anakinra was associated with a higher risk of serious infections; therefore, the concomitant use of SIMPONI ARIA and these biologic products is not recommended

                        <paragraph>Treatment with SIMPONI ARIA should not be initiated in patients with an active infection, including clinically important localized infections. Patients greater than 65 years of age, patients with co-morbid conditions and/or patients taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids or methotrexate may be at greater risk of infection.

                              <paragraph>Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection prior to therapy with TNF-blockers has been shown to reduce the risk of tuberculosis reactivation during therapy. Prior to initiating SIMPONI ARIA, assess if treatment for latent tuberculosis is needed; An induration of 5 mm or greater is a positive tuberculin skin test, even for patients previously vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of SIMPONI ARIA in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Cases of active tuberculosis have occurred in patients treated with the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab during and after treatment for latent tuberculosis.

                              <paragraph>The use of TNF-blockers, of which SIMPONI ARIA is a member, has been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients who are chronic hepatitis B carriers (i.e., surface antigen positive). In some instances, HBV reactivation occurring in conjunction with TNF-blocker therapy has been fatal. The majority of these reports have occurred in patients who received concomitant immunosuppressants.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>All patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating TNF-blocker therapy. For patients who test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is recommended before initiating TNF-blocker therapy. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to prescribing TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA, to patients who are carriers of HBV. Adequate data are not available on whether antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of HBV reactivation in HBV carriers who are treated with TNF-blockers. Patients who are carriers of HBV and require treatment with TNF-blockers should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In patients who develop HBV reactivation, TNF-blockers should be stopped and antiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. The safety of resuming TNF-blockers after HBV reactivation has been controlled is not known. Therefore, prescribers should exercise caution when considering resumption of TNF-blockers in this situation and monitor patients closely.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Malignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents, and young adults who received treatment with TNF-blocking agents (initiation of therapy â¤ 18 years of age), including golimumab. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other cases represented a variety of malignancies, including rare malignancies that are usually associated with immunosuppression, and malignancies that are not usually observed in children and adolescents. The malignancies occurred after a median of 30 months (range 1 to 84 months) after the first dose of TNF-blocker therapy. Most of the patients were receiving concomitant immunosuppressants. Most cases were reported postmarketing and are derived from a variety of sources, including registries and spontaneous postmarketing reports.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>The risks and benefits of TNF-blocker treatment including SIMPONI ARIA should be considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or when considering continuing a TNF-blocker in patients who develop a malignancy.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-blockers including the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab more cases of lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving anti-TNF treatment compared with patients in the control groups. Patients with RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly patients with highly active disease and/or chronic exposure to immunosuppressant therapies, may be at higher risk (up to several fold) than the general population for the development of lymphoma, even in the absence of TNF-blocking therapy. Cases of acute and chronic leukemia have been reported with TNF-blocker use, including SIMPONI ARIA, in rheumatoid arthritis and other indications. Even in the absence of TNF-blocker therapy, patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be at a higher risk (approximately 2-fold) than the general population for the development of leukemia.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Rare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients treated with TNF-blocking agents. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. Nearly all of the reported TNF-blocker associated cases have occurred in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. The majority were in adolescent and young adult males. Almost all these patients had received treatment with azathioprine (AZA) or 6-mercaptopurine (6âMP) concomitantly with a TNF-blocker at or prior to diagnosis.

In an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of the subcutaneous formulation of golimumab in patients with severe persistent asthma, more patients treated with golimumab reported malignancies compared with control patients.

                        <paragraph>Cases of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) and new onset CHF have been reported with TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA. Some cases had a fatal outcome. In several exploratory trials of other TNF-blockers in the treatment of CHF, there were greater proportions of TNF-blocker treated patients who had CHF exacerbations requiring hospitalization or increased mortality. SIMPONI ARIA has not been studied in patients with a history of CHF and SIMPONI ARIA should be used with caution in patients with CHF. If a decision is made to administer SIMPONI ARIA to patients with CHF, these patients should be closely monitored during therapy, and SIMPONI ARIA should be discontinued if new or worsening symptoms of CHF appear.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Use of TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA, has been associated with rare cases of new onset or exacerbation of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), and peripheral demyelinating disorders, including Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. Cases of central demyelination, MS, optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathy have rarely been reported in patients treated with golimumab. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of TNF-blockers, including SIMPONI ARIA, in patients with central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders. Discontinuation of SIMPONI ARIA should be considered if these disorders develop.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety data described below are based on one, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 trial in patients with RA receiving SIMPONI ARIA by intravenous infusion (Trial RA). The protocol included provisions for patients taking placebo to receive treatment with SIMPONI ARIA at Week 16 or Week 24 either by patient response (based on uncontrolled disease activity) or by design, so that adverse events cannot always be unambiguously attributed to a given treatment. Comparisons between placebo and SIMPONI ARIA were based on the first 24 weeks of exposure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Trial RA included 197 control-treated patients and 463 SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients (which includes control-treated patients who switched to SIMPONI ARIA at Week 16). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the controlled phase of Trial RA through Week 24 was 3.5% for SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and 0.5% for placebo-treated patients. Upper respiratory tract infection was the most common adverse reaction reported in the trial through Week 24 occurring in 6.5% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients as compared with 7.6% of control-treated patients, respectively.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In the controlled phase of Trial RA through Week 24, infections were observed in 27% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients compared with 24% of control-treated patients, and serious infections were observed in 0.9% of SIMPONI ARIA-treated patients and 0.0% of control-treated patients. Through Week 24, the incidence of serious infections per 100 patient-years of follow-up was 2.2 (95% CI 0.61, 5.71) for the SIMPONI ARIA group, and 0 (0.00, 3.79) for the placebo group. In the controlled and uncontrolled portions of Trial RA, 958 total patient-years of follow-up with a median follow-up of approximately 92 weeks, the incidence per 100 patient-years of all serious infections was 4.07 (95% CI: 2.90, 5.57) in patients receiving SIMPONI ARIA

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to golimumab in the trials described below with the incidence of antibodies in other trials or to other products may be misleading.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method, antibodies to golimumab were detected in 13 (3%) golimumab-treated patients following IV administration of SIMPONI ARIA in combination with MTX through Week 24 of Trial RA, of which all were neutralizing antibodies.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A drug-tolerant enzyme immunoassay (drug-tolerant EIA) method for detecting antibodies to golimumab was developed and validated. This method is approximately 16-fold more sensitive than the original EIA method with less interference from golimumab in serum. Through approximately 6 months, the incidence of antibodies to golimumab with the drug-tolerant EIA method for Trials RA, PsA, AS, and pJIA was 21%, 19%, 19% and 31%, respectively. Where tested, approximately one-third to one-half were neutralizing.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with RA, PsA, AS and pJIA who developed antibodies to golimumab generally had lower trough steady-state serum concentrations of golimumab

  </content>. Following IV administration, concomitant administration of methotrexate decreases the clearance of SIMPONI ARIA by approximately 9% based on population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. In addition, concomitant administration of methotrexate decreases the SIMPONI ARIA clearance by reducing the development of antibodies to golimumab.

                        <paragraph>An increased risk of serious infections has been seen in clinical RA studies of other TNF-blockers used in combination with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of SIMPONI ARIA with other biologic products, including abatacept or anakinra, is not recommended

  </content>. A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in RA patients treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF-blocker. The concomitant use of SIMPONI ARIA with biologics approved to treat RA, PsA, AS, and pJIA is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of infection.

                        <paragraph>The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., TNFÎ±) during chronic inflammation. Therefore, it is expected that for a molecule that antagonizes cytokine activity, such as golimumab, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. Upon initiation or discontinuation of SIMPONI ARIA in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Golimumab is a human IgG1Ò monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) that exhibits multiple glycoforms with molecular masses of approximately 150 to 151 kilodaltons. Golimumab was created using genetically engineered mice immunized with human TNF, resulting in an antibody with human-derived antibody variable and constant regions. Golimumab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion and is purified by a series of steps that includes measures to inactivate and remove viruses.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The SIMPONI ARIA
 
  <sup>Â®</sup>(golimumab) Injection is a sterile solution of the golimumab antibody supplied in a 4-mL glass vial for intravenous infusion.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>SIMPONI ARIA is a preservative-free, colorless to light yellow solution with a pH of approximately 5.5. SIMPONI ARIA is not made with natural rubber latex. Each 4-mL vial of SIMPONI ARIA contains 50 mg golimumab, L-histidine (1.14 mg), L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate (6.42 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.6 mg), sorbitol (180 mg), and water for injection.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Golimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to both the soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNFÎ±. This interaction prevents the binding of TNFÎ± to its receptors, thereby inhibiting the biological activity of TNFÎ± (a cytokine protein). There was no evidence of the golimumab antibody binding to other TNF superfamily ligands; in particular, the golimumab antibody did not bind or neutralize human lymphotoxin. Golimumab did not lyse human monocytes expressing transmembrane TNF in the presence of complement or effector cells.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Elevated TNFÎ± levels in the blood, synovium, and joints have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. TNFÎ± is an important mediator of the articular inflammation that is characteristic of these diseases. Golimumab modulated the
 
  <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>biological effects mediated by TNF in several bioassays, including the expression of adhesion proteins responsible for leukocyte infiltration (E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF and GM-CSF). The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of SIMPONI ARIA were evaluated in one multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial (Trial RA, NCT00973479) in 592 patients â¥ 18 years of age with moderately to severely active RA despite concurrent MTX therapy and had not previously been treated with a biologic TNF-blocker. Patients were diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, at least 3 months prior to administration of study agent and were required to have at least 6 swollen and 6 tender joints. Patients were randomized to receive either SIMPONI ARIA 2 mg/kg (N=395) or placebo (N=197) over a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter in addition to their weekly maintenance MTX dose (15â25 mg). All patients receiving placebo + MTX received SIMPONI ARIA + MTX after Week 24, but the trial remained blinded until all patients had completed 108 weeks of treatment. Efficacy data were collected and analyzed through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of concomitant low dose corticosteroids (equivalent to â¤ 10 mg of prednisone a day) and/or NSAIDs. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint in Trial RA was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 14. In Trial RA, the majority of subjects were women (82%) and were Caucasian (80%) with a median age of 52 years and a median weight of 70 kg. Median disease duration was 4.7 years, and 50% of the patients used at least one DMARD other than MTX in the past. At baseline, 81% of patients received concomitant NSAIDs and 81% of patients received low-dose corticosteroids (equivalent to â¤ 10 mg of prednisone a day). The median baseline DAS28-CRP was 5.9 and the median van der Heijde-Sharp score at baseline was 28.5.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of SIMPONI ARIA were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 480 patients â¥ 18 years of age with active psoriatic arthritis despite NSAID or DMARD therapy (Trial PsA, NCT02181673). Previous treatment with a biologic was not allowed. Patients in this trial had a diagnosis of PsA for at least six months and had symptoms of active disease [â¥5 swollen joints and â¥5 tender joints and a CRP level of â¥ 0.6 mg/dL]. Patients were randomized to either receive SIMPONI ARIA 2 mg/kg (N=241) or placebo (N=239) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. All patients on placebo received SIMPONI ARIA at Week 24, Week 28 and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the SIMPONI ARIA treatment group continued to receive SIMPONI ARIA infusions at Week 28 and every 8 weeks through Week 52.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of MTX, NSAIDs, and low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to â¤ 10 mg of prednisone per day) during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 14.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with each subtype of PsA were enrolled, including polyarticular arthritis with absence of rheumatoid nodules (44%), asymmetric peripheral arthritis (19%), distal interphalangeal joint involvement (8.1%), spondylitis with peripheral arthritis (25%), and arthritis mutilans (4.8%). The median duration of PsA disease was 3.5 years, 86% of patients had previously used MTX, and 35% of patients received at least one other DMARD in the past. At baseline, 76% and 54% of the patients had enthesitis and dactylitis, respectively. The median total modified vdH-S score at baseline was 15.5. During the trial, concomitant medications used included MTX (70%), oral corticosteroids (28%), and NSAIDs (71%).</paragraph>

  <linkHtml href="#table5">Table 5</linkHtml>). Similar ACR 20 responses at Week 24 were observed in patients with different PsA subtypes. ACR 20 responses observed in the SIMPONI ARIA-treated groups were similar in patients who were or were not receiving concomitant MTX.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of SIMPONI ARIA were evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Trial AS, NCT02186873) in 208 patients â¥ 18 years of age with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and inadequate response or intolerance to NSAIDs. Patients had a diagnosis of definite AS for at least 3 months according to modified New York criteria. Patients had symptoms of active disease [Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) â¥ 4, VAS for total back pain of â¥ 4, on scales of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 100 mm), and a hsCRP level of â¥ 0.3 mg/dL (3 mg/L)]. Patients were randomized to receive either SIMPONI ARIA 2 mg/kg (N=105) or placebo (N=103) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. All patients on placebo received SIMPONI ARIA at Week 16, Week 20 and every 8 weeks thereafter through Week 52. Patients in the SIMPONI ARIA treatment group continued to receive SIMPONI ARIA infusions at Week 20 and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients were allowed to continue stable doses of concomitant MTX, SSZ, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), low dose oral corticosteroids (equivalent to â¤ 10 mg of prednisone per day), and/or NSAIDs during the trial. The use of other DMARDs including cytotoxic agents or other biologics was prohibited.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving an Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) 20 response at Week 16.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Trial AS, the median duration of AS disease was 2.8 years, median duration of inflammatory back pain was 8 years, 90% were HLA-B27 positive, 8.2% had prior joint surgery or procedure, 5.8% had complete ankylosis of the spine, 14% had received prior therapy with one biologic TNF blocker (other than golimumab) and discontinued for reasons other than lack of efficacy within the first 16 weeks of treatment (primary failure), and 76% received at least one DMARD in the past. During the trial, the use of concomitant medications was NSAIDs (88%), SSZ (38%), corticosteroids (26%), MTX (18%), and HCQ (0.5%).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of SIMPONI ARIA in pediatric patients with pJIA is based on the pharmacokinetic exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of SIMPONI ARIA in RA patients. Efficacy of SIMPONI ARIA was also assessed in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in 127 children (2 to &lt; 18 years of age) with JIA with active polyarthritis despite treatment with MTX for at least 2 months (Trial pJIA, NCT02277444). The polyarticular JIA patient subtypes at study entry included: rheumatoid factor negative (43%), rheumatoid factor positive (35%), enthesitis-related arthritis (9%), oligoarticular extended (6%), juvenile psoriatic arthritis (4%), and systemic JIA without systemic manifestations (3%). All patients received SIMPONI ARIA 80 mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>as an intravenous infusion at Week 0, 4, and every 8 weeks through Week 52. Patients continued stable doses of MTX weekly through Week 28; after Week 28, changes in MTX dose were permitted. Efficacy was assessed as supportive endpoints through Week 52. The efficacy was generally consistent with responses in patients with RA.
