                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical studies, finasteride, a component of finasteride and tadalafil, reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride and tadalafil, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride and tadalafil may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride and tadalafil therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride and tadalafil for six months or more, double the PSA values for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride and tadalafil.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Finasteride and tadalafil may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride and tadalafil. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride and tadalafil therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary.</paragraph>

Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with a different 5α-reductase inhibitor.

                        <paragraph>Instruct patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, to seek emergency medical attention. Use finasteride and tadalafil with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie’s disease).</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.10 Ocular Adverse Reactions</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including finasteride and tadalafil, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5 to 11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged 50 years and older.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Consider whether patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, use PDE5 inhibitors, including finasteride and tadalafil, with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with “crowded” optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population; however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including finasteride and tadalafil, for this uncommon condition.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use of finasteride and tadalafil in these patients is not recommended.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>An observational case-crossover study evaluated the risk of NAION when PDE5 inhibitor use, as a class, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION, with a risk estimate of 2.15 (95% CI 1.06, 4.34). A similar study reported a consistent result, with a risk estimate of 2.27 (95% CI 0.99, 5.20). Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of “crowded” optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION in these studies.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Neither the rare postmarketing reports, nor the association of PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION in the observational studies, substantiate a causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Advise patients to stop taking finasteride and tadalafil and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including finasteride and tadalafil.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil, a component of finasteride and tadalafil, is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. Finasteride and tadalafil has not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although tadalafil, a component of finasteride and tadalafil, has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use finasteride and tadalafil with caution in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration after a careful risk-benefit assessment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (&lt;1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of tadalafil for BPH or a different indication and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Table 3. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (&lt;5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. In studies of tadalafil for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of &lt;1% across all indications.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Across all studies with any tadalafil dose, changes in color vision were reported in &lt;0.1% of patients.</paragraph>

A causal relationship of these events to tadalafil is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Finasteride:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rats received finasteride during the period of major organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17). At maternal doses of oral finasteride approximately 0.1 to 86 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 5 mg/day (based on AUC at animal doses of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg/day) there was a dose-dependent increase in hypospadias that occurred in 3.6 to 100% of male offspring. Exposure multiples were estimated using data from nonpregnant rats. Days 16 to 17 of gestation is a critical period in male fetal rats for differentiation of the external genitalia. At oral maternal doses approximately 0.03 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day), male offspring had decreased prostatic and seminal vesicular weights, delayed preputial separation and transient nipple development. Decreased anogenital distance occurred in male offspring of pregnant rats that received approximately 0.003 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 0.003 mg/kg/day). No abnormalities were observed in female offspring at any maternal dose of finasteride.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Slightly decreased fertility was observed in male offspring after administration of about 3 times the MRHD (based on AUC at animal dose of 3 mg/kg/day) to female rats during late gestation and lactation. No effects on fertility were seen in female offspring under these conditions.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>No evidence of male external genital malformations or other abnormalities were observed in rabbit fetuses exposed to finasteride during the period of major organogenesis (gestation days 618) at maternal oral doses up to 100 mg/kg/day, (finasteride exposure levels were not measured in rabbits). However, this study may not have included the critical period for finasteride effects on development of male external genitalia in the rabbit.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The fetal effects of maternal finasteride exposure were evaluated during the period of embryonic and fetal development from gestation day 20-100 in the rhesus monkey. Intravenous administration of finasteride to pregnant monkeys at doses as high as 800 ng/day (estimated maximal blood concentration of 1.86 ng/mL or about 143 times the highest estimated exposure of pregnant women to finasteride from semen of men taking 5 mg/day) resulted in no abnormalities in male fetuses. However, oral administration of finasteride (2 mg/kg/day or approximately 18,000 times the highest estimated blood levels of finasteride from semen of men taking 5 mg/day) to pregnant monkeys resulted in external genital abnormalities in male fetuses. No other abnormalities were observed in male fetuses and no finasteride-related abnormalities were observed in female fetuses at any dose.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Tadalafil:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Animal reproduction studies showed no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, or fetotoxicity when tadalafil was given orally to pregnant rats or mice at exposures up to 44 times the indicated dose of 5 mg/day during organogenesis. In a prenatal/postnatal developmental study in rats, postnatal pup survival decreased following maternal exposure to tadalafil doses greater than 40 times the indicated dose based on AUC. Signs of maternal toxicity occurred at doses greater than 64 times the indicated dose based on AUC. Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive performance.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In another rat prenatal and postnatal development study at doses of 60, 200, and 1000 mg/kg, a reduction in postnatal survival of pups was observed. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for maternal toxicity was 200 mg/kg/day and for developmental toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day. This gives approximately 64-and 40 fold exposure multiples, respectively, of the human AUC for the indicated dose of 5 mg.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Tadalafil and/or its metabolites cross the placenta, resulting in fetal exposure in rats.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The development and enlargement of the prostate gland is dependent on the potent androgen, 5αdihydrotestosterone (DHT). Type II 5α-reductase metabolizes testosterone to DHT in the prostate gland, liver and skin. DHT induces androgenic effects by binding to androgen receptors in the cell nuclei of these organs.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Finasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase with which it slowly forms a stable enzyme complex. Turnover from this complex is extremely slow (t½ ~ 30 days). This has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Finasteride has no affinity for the androgen receptor. In man, the 5α-reduced steroid metabolites in blood and urine are decreased after administration of finasteride.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mechanism for reducing BPH symptoms has not been established. Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5). PDE5 is found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, prostate, and bladder as well as in vascular and visceral smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, urethra, platelets, kidney, lung, cerebellum, heart, liver, testis, seminal vesicle, and pancreas.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In vitro studies have shown that the effect of tadalafil is more potent on PDE5 than on other phosphodiesterases. These studies have shown that tadalafil is &gt;10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE1, PDE2, PDE4, and PDE7 enzymes, which are found in the heart, brain, blood vessels, liver, leukocytes, skeletal muscle, and other organs. Tadalafil is &gt;10,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE3, an enzyme found in the heart and blood vessels. Additionally, tadalafil is 700-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE6, which is found in the retina and is responsible for phototransduction. Tadalafil is &gt;9,000-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE8, PDE9, and PDE10. Tadalafil is 14-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE11A1 and 40-fold more potent for PDE5 than for PDE11A4, two of the four known forms of PDE11. PDE11 is an enzyme found in human prostate, testes, skeletal muscle and in other tissues (e.g., adrenal cortex). In vitro, tadalafil inhibits human recombinant PDE11A1 and, to a lesser degree, PDE11A4 activities at concentrations within the therapeutic range. The physiological role and clinical consequence of PDE11 inhibition in humans have not been defined.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In man, a single 5-mg oral dose of finasteride produces a rapid reduction in serum DHT concentration, with the maximum effect observed 8 hours after the first dose. The suppression of DHT is maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval and with continued treatment. Daily dosing of finasteride at 5 mg/day for up to 4 years has been shown to reduce the serum DHT concentration by approximately 70%. The median circulating level of testosterone increased by approximately 10-20% but remained within the physiologic range. In a separate study in healthy men treated with finasteride 1 mg per day (n=82) or placebo (n=69), mean circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol were increased by approximately 15% as compared to baseline, but these remained within the physiologic range.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In patients receiving finasteride 5 mg/day, increases of about 10% were observed in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but levels remained within the normal range. In healthy volunteers, treatment with finasteride did not alter the response of LH and FSH to gonadotropin-releasing hormone indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis was not affected.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In patients with BPH, finasteride has no effect on circulating levels of cortisol, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, or thyroxine. No clinically meaningful effect was observed on the plasma lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, high density lipoproteins and triglycerides) or bone mineral density.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Adult males with genetically inherited Type II 5α-reductase deficiency also have decreased levels of DHT. Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth, no other clinical abnormalities related to Type II 5α-reductase deficiency have been observed in these individuals. These individuals have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In patients with BPH treated with finasteride (1-100 mg/day) for 7-10 days prior to prostatectomy, an approximate 80% lower DHT content was measured in prostatic tissue removed at surgery, compared to placebo; testosterone tissue concentration was increased up to 10 times over pretreatment levels, relative to placebo. Intraprostatic content of PSA was also decreased.</paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>In healthy male volunteers treated with finasteride 5 mg/day for 14 days, discontinuation of therapy resulted in a return of DHT levels to pretreatment levels in approximately 2 weeks. In patients treated for three months, prostate volume, which declined by approximately 20%, returned to close to baseline value after approximately three months of discontinuation of therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In clinical pharmacology studies, tadalafil (5 to 20 mg) was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates.

                        <paragraph>A study was conducted to assess the degree of interaction between nitroglycerin and tadalafil, should nitroglycerin be required in an emergency situation after tadalafil was taken. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 150 male subjects at least 40 years of age (including subjects with diabetes mellitus and/or controlled hypertension) and receiving daily doses of tadalafil 20 mg or matching placebo for 7 days. Subjects were administered a single dose of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) at pre-specified timepoints, following their last dose of tadalafil (2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after tadalafil). The objective of the study was to determine when, after tadalafil dosing, no apparent blood pressure interaction was observed. In this study, a significant interaction between tadalafil and NTG was observed at each timepoint up to and including 24 hours. At 48 hours, by most hemodynamic measures, the interaction between tadalafil and NTG was not observed, although a few more tadalafil subjects compared to placebo experienced greater blood-pressure lowering at this timepoint. After 48 hours, the interaction was not detectable (see Figure 1).</paragraph>

Outliers were defined as subjects with a standing systolic blood pressure of &lt;85 mm Hg or a decrease from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure of &gt;30 mm Hg at one or more time points. There were nine and three outliers following administration of tadalafil 20 mg and placebo, respectively. Five and two subjects were outliers due to a decrease from baseline in standing systolic BP of &gt;30 mm Hg, while five and one subject were outliers due to standing systolic BP &lt;85 mm Hg following tadalafil and placebo, respectively. Severe adverse events potentially related to blood-pressure effects were assessed. No such events were reported following placebo. Two such events were reported following administration of tadalafil. Vertigo was reported in one subject that began 7 hours after dosing and lasted about 5 days. This subject previously experienced a mild episode of vertigo on doxazosin and placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Alcohol and PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are mild systemic vasodilators. The interaction of tadalafil with alcohol was evaluated in 3 clinical pharmacology studies. In 2 of these, alcohol was administered at a dose of 0.7 g/kg, which is equivalent to approximately 6 ounces of 80proof vodka in an 80-kg male, and tadalafil was administered at a dose of 10 mg in one study and 20 mg in another. In both these studies, all patients imbibed the entire alcohol dose within 10 minutes of starting. In one of these two studies, blood alcohol levels of 0.08% were confirmed. In these two studies, more patients had clinically significant decreases in blood pressure on the combination of tadalafil and alcohol as compared to alcohol alone. Some subjects reported postural dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension was observed in some subjects. When tadalafil 20 mg was administered with a lower dose of alcohol (0.6 g/kg, which is equivalent to approximately 4 ounces of 80-proof vodka, administered in less than 10 minutes), orthostatic hypotension was not observed, dizziness occurred with similar frequency to alcohol alone, and the hypotensive effects of alcohol were not potentiated.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effects of tadalafil on cardiac function, hemodynamics, and exercise tolerance were investigated in a single clinical pharmacology study. In this blinded crossover trial, 23 subjects with stable coronary artery disease and evidence of exercise-induced cardiac ischemia were enrolled. The primary endpoint was time to cardiac ischemia. The mean difference in total exercise time was 3 seconds (tadalafil 10 mg minus placebo), which represented no clinically meaningful difference. Further statistical analysis demonstrated that tadalafil was non-inferior to placebo with respect to time to ischemia. Of note, in this study, in some subjects who received tadalafil followed by sublingual nitroglycerin in the post-exercise period, clinically significant reductions in blood pressure were observed, consistent with the augmentation by tadalafil of the blood-pressure-lowering effects of nitrates.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Single oral doses of phosphodiesterase inhibitors have demonstrated transient dose-related impairment of color discrimination (blue/green), using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test, with peak effects near the time of peak plasma levels. This finding is consistent with the inhibition of PDE6, which is involved in phototransduction in the retina. In a study to assess the effects of a single dose of tadalafil 40 mg on vision (N=59), no effects were observed on visual acuity, intraocular pressure, or pupilometry. Across all clinical studies with tadalafil, reports of changes in color vision were rare (&lt;0.1% of patients).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Three studies were conducted in men to assess the potential effect on sperm characteristics of tadalafil 10 mg (one 6 month study) and 20 mg (one 6 month and one 9 month study) administered daily. There were no adverse effects on sperm morphology or sperm motility in any of the three studies. In the study of 10 mg tadalafil for 6 months and the study of 20 mg tadalafil for 9 months, results showed a decrease in mean sperm concentrations relative to placebo, although these differences were not clinically meaningful. This effect was not seen in the study of 20 mg tadalafil taken for 6 months. In addition there was no adverse effect on mean concentrations of reproductive hormones, testosterone, luteinizing hormone or follicle stimulating hormone with either 10 or 20 mg of tadalafil compared to placebo.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of a single 100-mg dose of tadalafil on the QT interval was evaluated at the time of peak tadalafil concentration in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo, and active (intravenous ibutilide) -controlled crossover study in 90 healthy males aged 18 to 53 years. The mean change in QTc (Fridericia QT correction) for tadalafil, relative to placebo, was 3.5 milliseconds (two-sided 90% CI=1.9, 5.1). The mean change in QTc (Individual QT correction) for tadalafil, relative to placebo, was 2.8 milliseconds (two-sided 90% CI=1.2, 4.4). A 100-mg dose of tadalafil (20 times the highest recommended dose) was chosen because this dose yields exposures covering those observed upon coadministration of tadalafil with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or those observed in renal impairment. In this study, the mean increase in heart rate associated with a 100-mg dose of tadalafil compared to placebo was 3.1 beats per minute.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Tadalafil is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 to a catechol metabolite. The catechol metabolite undergoes extensive methylation and glucuronidation to form the methylcatechol and methylcatechol glucuronide conjugate, respectively. The major circulating metabolite is the methylcatechol glucuronide. Methylcatechol concentrations are less than 10% of glucuronide concentrations. In vitro data suggests that metabolites are not expected to be pharmacologically active at observed metabolite concentrations.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Finasteride:</content> No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed in a 24-month study in Sprague-Dawley rats receiving doses of finasteride up to 160 mg/kg/day in males and 320 mg/kg/day in females. These doses produced respective systemic exposure in rats of 111 and 274 times those observed in man receiving the recommended human dose of 5 mg/day. All exposure calculations were based on calculated AUC<sub>(0-24 hr)</sub> for animals and mean AUC<sub>(0-24 hr)</sub> for man (0.4 μg•hr/mL). In a 19-month carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, a statistically significant (p≤0.05) increase in the incidence of testicular Leydig cell adenomas was observed at 228 times the human exposure (250 mg/kg/day). In mice at 23 times the human exposure (25 mg/kg/day) and in rats at 39 times the human exposure (40 mg/kg/day) an increase in the incidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia was observed. A positive correlation between the proliferative changes in the Leydig cells and an increase in serum LH levels (2-to 3-fold above control) has been demonstrated in both rodent species treated with high doses of finasteride. No drug-related Leydig cell changes were seen in either rats or dogs treated with finasteride for 1 year at 30 and 350 times (20 mg/kg/day and 45 mg/kg/day, respectively) or in mice treated for 19 months at 2.3 times the human exposure, estimated (2.5 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>

In sexually mature male rats treated with 61 times the human exposure (80 mg/kg/day), there were no significant effects on fertility after 6 or 12 weeks of treatment; however, when treatment was continued for up to 24 or 30 weeks, there was an apparent decrease in fertility, fecundity and an associated significant decrease in the weights of the seminal vesicles and prostate. All these effects were reversible within 6 weeks of discontinuation of treatment. No drug-related effect on testes or on mating performance has been seen in rats or rabbits. This decrease in fertility in finasteride-treated rats is secondary to its effect on accessory sex organs (prostate and seminal vesicles) resulting in failure to form a seminal plug. The seminal plug is essential for normal fertility in rats and is not relevant in man.</paragraph>

In beagle dogs given tadalafil daily for 3 to 12 months, there was treatment-related non-reversible degeneration and atrophy of the seminiferous tubular epithelium in the testes in 20-100% of the dogs that resulted in a decrease in spermatogenesis in 40-75% of the dogs at doses of ≥10 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposure (based on AUC) at no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) (10 mg/kg/day) for unbound tadalafil was similar to that expected in humans at a dose of 20 mg.

                  <paragraph>The efficacy of finasteride and tadalafil is based on an adequate and well-controlled study of tadalafil co-administered with finasteride. Below is the description of this study.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Tadalafil for once daily use initiated together with finasteride was shown to be effective in treating the signs and symptoms of BPH in men with an enlarged prostate (&gt;30 cc) for up to 26 weeks. A double-blinded, parallel-design study of 26 weeks duration randomized 696 men to initiate either tadalafil 5 mg with finasteride 5 mg or placebo with finasteride 5 mg. The study population had a mean age of 64 years (range 46-86). Patients with multiple co-morbid conditions such as erectile dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other cardiovascular disease were included.</paragraph>
                  <br/>
                  <paragraph>Tadalafil and finasteride administered together demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of BPH compared to placebo with finasteride, as measured by the total symptom score (IPSS) at 12 weeks, the primary study endpoint (see Table 12). Key secondary endpoints demonstrated improvement in total IPSS starting at the first scheduled observation at week 4 (tadalafil -4.0, placebo -2.3: p&lt;.001) and the score remained decreased through 26 weeks (tadalafil -5.5, placebo -4.5; p=.022). However, the magnitude of the treatment difference between placebo/finasteride and tadalafil/finasteride decreased from 1.7 points at Week 4 to 1.0 point at Week 26, as shown in Table 12 and in Figure 4. The incremental benefit of finasteride and tadalafil beyond 26 weeks is unknown.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>BPH is an enlargement of the prostate gland. The prostate is located below the bladder. As the prostate enlarges, it may slowly restrict the flow of urine. This can lead to symptoms such as: </paragraph>

                     <item>a weak or interrupted urinary stream</item>

                     <content styleCode="bold">What finasteride and tadalafil does:</content>
                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Finasteride and tadalafil contains finasteride and tadalafil. Finasteride lowers levels of a hormone called DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which is a cause of prostate growth. Lowering DHT leads to shrinkage of the enlarged prostate gland in most men. This can lead to gradual improvement in urine flow and symptoms over the next several months. Finasteride and tadalafil will help reduce the risk of developing a sudden inability to pass urine (urinary retention) and the need for surgery related to an enlarged prostate. Tadalafil may reduce BPH symptoms by inhibiting the action of an enzyme called PDE5 (phosphodiesterase 5), which relaxes the smooth muscle found in the part of the prostate that surrounds the urethra resulting in the release of the restriction to the flow of urine through the urethra. However, since each case of BPH is different, you should know that:</paragraph>
