                        <paragraph>Administer duloxetine delayed-release capsules orally (with or without meals) and swallow whole. Do not chew or crush, and do not open the delayed-release capsule and sprinkle its contents on food or mix with liquids because these actions might affect the enteric coating. If a dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules is missed, take the missed dose as soon as it is remembered. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses of duloxetine delayed-release capsules at the same time.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Do not start duloxetine delayed-release capsules in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. In a patient who requires more urgent treatment of a psychiatric condition, other interventions, including hospitalization, should be considered <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#Section_4">4</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph>In some cases, a patient already receiving duloxetine delayed-release capsules therapy may require urgent treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. If acceptable alternatives to linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are not available and the potential benefits of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of serotonin syndrome in a particular patient, duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be stopped promptly, and linezolid or intravenous methylene blue can be administered. The patient should be monitored for symptoms of serotonin syndrome for 5 days or until 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, whichever comes first. Therapy with duloxetine delayed-release capsules may be resumed 24 hours after the last dose of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.13">5.4</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph>The risk of administering methylene blue by non-intravenous routes (such as oral tablets or by local injection) or in intravenous doses much lower than 1 mg/kg with duloxetine delayed-release capsules is unclear. The clinician should, nevertheless, be aware of the possibility of emergent symptoms of serotonin syndrome with such use <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.13">5.4</linkHtml>)].</content>

                     <title>5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.</paragraph>

Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#Section_2.8">2.8</linkHtml>) and Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.10">5.7</linkHtml>)] </content>for descriptions of the risks of discontinuation of duloxetine.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that duloxetine is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.<br/>

                     <title>5.2 Hepatotoxicity</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>There have been reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, in patients treated with duloxetine. These cases have presented as hepatitis with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevation of transaminase levels to more than twenty times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with or without jaundice, reflecting a mixed or hepatocellular pattern of liver injury. Duloxetine should be discontinued in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction and should not be resumed unless another cause can be established.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Cases of cholestatic jaundice with minimal elevation of transaminase levels have also been reported. Other postmarketing reports indicate that elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase have occurred in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Duloxetine increased the risk of elevation of serum transaminase levels in development program clinical trials. Liver transaminase elevations resulted in the discontinuation of 0.3% (92/34,756) of duloxetine-treated patients. In most patients, the median time to detection of the transaminase elevation was about two months. In adult placebo-controlled trials, for patients with normal and abnormal baseline ALT values, elevation of ALT greater than 3 times the ULN occurred in 1.25% (144/11,496) of duloxetine-treated patients compared to 0.45% (39/8716) of placebo-treated patients. In adult placebo-controlled studies using a fixed dose design, there was evidence of a duloxetine dose response relationship for ALT and AST elevation of greater than 3 times the ULN and greater than 5 times the ULN, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Because it is possible that duloxetine and alcohol may interact to cause liver injury or that duloxetine may aggravate pre-existing liver disease, duloxetine delayed-release capsules should not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Orthostatic hypotension, falls, and syncope have been reported in patients treated with the recommended duloxetine dosages. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of therapy but can occur at any time during duloxetine treatment, particularly after dose increases. The risk of falling appears to be related to the degree of orthostatic decrease in blood pressure (BP) as well as other factors that may increase the underlying risk of falls.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an analysis of patients from all placebo-controlled trials, patients treated with duloxetine reported a higher rate of falls compared to patients treated with placebo. Risk appears to be related to the presence of orthostatic decrease in BP. The risk of BP decreases may be greater in patients taking concomitant medications that induce orthostatic hypotension (such as antihypertensives) or are potent CYP1A2 inhibitors <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.5">5.12</linkHtml>) and Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_7.1">7.1</linkHtml>)]</content> and in patients taking duloxetine at doses above 60 mg daily. Consideration should be given to dose reduction or discontinuation of duloxetine in patients who experience symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, falls and/or syncope during duloxetine therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Risk of falling also appeared to be proportional to a patient’s underlying risk for falls and appeared to increase steadily with age. As geriatric patients tend to have a higher underlying risk for falls due to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as use of multiple medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including fractures and hospitalizations have been reported with duloxetine use <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_6.1">6.1</linkHtml>)].</content>

                        <paragraph>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including duloxetine, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs, <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#Section_4">4</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_7.13">7.13</linkHtml>)]</content>. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The concomitant use of duloxetine with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate duloxetine in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking duloxetine, discontinue duloxetine before initiating treatment with the MAOI <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#Section_4">4</linkHtml>) and Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_7.13">7.13</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor all patients taking duloxetine for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with duloxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of duloxetine with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including duloxetine, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. A post-marketing study showed a higher incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in mothers taking duloxetine. Other bleeding events related to SSRI and SNRI use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking duloxetine. Following abrupt or tapered discontinuation in adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following symptoms occurred at 1% or greater and at a significantly higher rate in duloxetine-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with duloxetine. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#Section_2.8">2.8</linkHtml>)]</content>.<br/>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In adult placebo-controlled clinical trials across the approved adult populations from baseline to endpoint, duloxetine treatment was associated with mean increases of 0.5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 0.8 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure compared to mean decreases of 0.6 mm Hg systolic and 0.3 mm Hg diastolic in placebo- treated patients. There was no significant difference in the frequency of sustained (3 consecutive visits) elevated blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study designed to evaluate the effects of duloxetine on various parameters, including blood pressure at supratherapeutic doses with an accelerated dose titration, there was evidence of increases in supine blood pressure at doses up to 200 mg twice daily (approximately 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage). At the highest 200 mg twice daily dose, the increase in mean pulse rate was 5.0 to 6.8 beats and increases in mean blood pressure were 4.7 to 6.8 mm Hg (systolic) and 4.5 to 7 mm Hg (diastolic) up to 12 hours after dosing. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including duloxetine. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

Geriatric patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk <content styleCode="italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#Section_8.5">8.5</linkHtml>)]</content>.

In male patients, SNRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SNRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. <br/>  It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of duloxetine and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of patients who experienced, at least once, one treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine delayed-release capsules in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD (N=3779), GAD (N=1018), OA (N=503), CLBP (N=600), DPNP (N=906), and FM (N=1294). The age range in this pooled population was 17 years to 89 years of age. In this pooled population, 66%, 61%, 61%, 43%, and 94% of adult patients were female; and 82%, 73%, 85%, 74%, and 86% of adult patients were Caucasian in the MDD, GAD, OA and CLBP, DPNP, and FM populations, respectively. Most patients received duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of a total of 60 mg to 120 mg per day <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#Section_14">14</linkHtml>)]</content>. The data below do not include results of the trial that evaluated the efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of GAD in patients greater than or equal to 65 years old (Study GAD-5)<content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#Section_14.3">14.3</linkHtml>)]</content>; however, the adverse reactions observed in this geriatric population were generally similar to adverse reactions in the overall adult population.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of psychiatric disorders or diabetes, but they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. Because adverse sexual reactions are presumed to be voluntarily underreported, the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), a validated measure designed to identify sexual adverse reactions, was used prospectively in 4 MDD placebo-controlled adult trials (Studies MDD-1, MDD-2, MDD-3, and MDD-4) <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (<linkHtml href="#Section_14.2">14.2</linkHtml>)]</content>. The ASEX scale includes five questions that pertain to the following aspects of sexual function: 1) sex drive, 2) ease of arousal, 3) ability to achieve erection (men) or lubrication (women), 4) ease of reaching orgasm, and 5) orgasm satisfaction. Positive numbers signify a worsening of sexual function from baseline. Negative numbers signify an improvement from a baseline level of dysfunction, which is commonly seen in depressed patients. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In these trials, duloxetine -treated male patients experienced significantly more sexual dysfunction, as measured by the total score on the ASEX and the ability to reach orgasm, than placebo-treated male patients (see Table 5). duloxetine -treated female patients did not experience more sexual dysfunction than placebo-treated female patients as measured by ASEX total score. Healthcare providers should routinely inquire about possible sexual adverse reactions in duloxetine -treated patients.                                                         </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated withduloxetine in clinical adult trials. In clinical trials of all approved adult populations, 34,756 patients were treated with duloxetine. Of these, 27% (9337) took duloxetine for at least 6 months, and 12% (4317) took duloxetine for at least one year. The following listing is not intended to include reactions (1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, (2) for which a drug cause was remote, (3) which were so general as to be uninformative, (4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or (5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Reactions are categorized by body system according to the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs and SNRIs. Duloxetine -treated pediatric patients in clinical trials experienced a 0.1kg mean decrease in weight at 10 weeks, compared with a mean weight gain of approximately 0.9 kg in placebo-treated pediatric patients. The proportion of patients who experienced a clinically significant decrease in weight (greater than or equal to 3.5%) was greater in the duloxetine group than in the placebo group (16% and 6%, respectively). Subsequently, over the 4- to 6-month uncontrolled extension periods, duloxetine -treated patients on average trended toward recovery to their expected baseline weight percentile based on population data from age- and sex-matched peers. </paragraph>

While height increase was observed during these studies, a mean decrease of 1% in height percentile was observed (decrease of 2% in patients 7 years to 11 years of age and increase of 0.3% in patients 12 years to 17 years of age).

                     <title>7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are co-administered with warfarin. Concomitant administration of warfarin (2 mg to 9 mg once daily) under steady state conditions with duloxetine 60 mg or 120 mg once daily for up to 14 days in healthy subjects (n=15) did not significantly change INR from baseline (mean INR changes ranged from 0.05 to +0.07). The total warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) pharmacokinetics (AUC<sub>T,ss,</sub> C<sub>max,ss </sub>or t<sub>max,ss</sub>) for both R- and S-warfarin were not altered by duloxetine. Because of the potential effect of duloxetine on platelets, patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when duloxetine is initiated or discontinued <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.12">5.5</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Duloxetine has an enteric coating that resists dissolution until reaching a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the pH exceeds 5.5. In extremely acidic conditions, duloxetine, unprotected by the enteric coating, may undergo hydrolysis to form naphthol. Caution is advised in using duloxetine in patients with conditions that may slow gastric emptying (e.g., some diabetics). Drugs that raise the gastrointestinal pH may lead to an earlier release of duloxetine. However, co-administration of duloxetine with aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids (51 mEq) or duloxetine with famotidine, had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose. It is unknown whether the concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors affects duloxetine absorption <content styleCode="italics">[seeWarnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.3">5.14</linkHtml>)]</content>.<br/>

                        <paragraph>Data from a postmarketing retrospective cohort study indicate that use of duloxetine in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Data from published literature and from a postmarketing retrospective cohort study have not identified a clear drug-associated risk of major birth defects or other adverse developmental outcomes <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. There are risks associated with untreated depression and fibromyalgia in pregnancy, and with exposure to SNRIs and SSRIs, including duloxetine, during pregnancy <content styleCode="italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In rats and rabbits treated with duloxetine during the period of organogenesis, fetal weights were decreased but there was no evidence of developmental effects at doses up to 3 times and 6 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 120 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. When duloxetine was administered orally to pregnant rats throughout gestation and lactation, pup weights at birth and pup survival to 1 day postpartum were decreased at a dose 2 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. At this dose, pup behaviors consistent with increased reactivity, such as increased startle response to noise and decreased habituation of locomotor activity were observed. Post-weaning growth was not adversely affected.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective, longitudinal study that followed 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Pregnant women with fibromyalgia are at increased risk for adverse maternal and infant outcomes including preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm birth, small for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, placental disruption, and venous thrombosis. It is not known if these adverse maternal and fetal outcomes are a direct result of fibromyalgia or other comorbid factors.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Neonates exposed to duloxetine and other SNRIs or SSRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of the SNRIs or SSRIs, orpossibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome <content styleCode="italics"> [see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.13">5.4</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Data from a postmarketing retrospective claims-based cohort study found an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage among 955 pregnant women exposed to duloxetine in the last month of pregnancy compared to 4,128,460 unexposed pregnant women (adjusted relative risk: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.18). The same study did not find a clinically meaningful increase in the risk for major birth defects in the comparison of 2532 women exposed to duloxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy to 1,284,827 unexposed women after adjusting for several confounders. Methodologic limitations include possible residual confounding, misclassification of exposure and outcomes, lack of direct measures of disease severity, and lack of information about alcohol use, nutrition, and over-the-counter medication exposures.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, duloxetine has been shown to have adverse effects on embryo/fetal and postnatal development.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When duloxetine was administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis, there was no evidence of malformations or developmental variations at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day [3 times and 6 times, respectively, the MRHD of 120 mg/day given to adolescents on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis]. However, fetal weights were decreased at this dose, with a no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day (approximately equal to the MRHD in rats and 2 times the MRHD in rabbits).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When duloxetine was administered orally to pregnant rats throughout gestation and lactation, the survival of pups to 1 day postpartum and pup body weights at birth and during the lactation period were decreased at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis); the no-effect dose was 10 mg/kg/day. Furthermore, behaviors consistent with increased reactivity, such as increased startle response to noise and decreased habituation of locomotor activity, were observed in pups following maternal exposure to 30 mg/kg/day. Post-weaning growth and reproductive performance of the progeny were not affected adversely by maternal duloxetine treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Disposition of duloxetine was studied in 6 lactating women who were at least 12 weeks postpartum and had elected to wean their infants. The women were given 40 mg of duloxetine twice daily for 3.5 days. The peak concentration measured in breast milk occurred at a median of 3 hours after the dose. The amount of duloxetine in breast milk was approximately 7 mcg/day while on that dose; the estimated daily infant dose was approximately 2 mcg/kg/day,which is less than 1% of the maternal dose. The presence of duloxetine metabolites in breast milk was not examined.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In an analysis of data from all placebo-controlled-trials, duloxetine -treated patients reported a higher rate of falls compared to placebo-treated patients. The increased risk appears to be proportional to a patient’s underlying risk for falls. Underlying risk appears to increase steadily with age. As geriatric patients tend to have a higher prevalence of risk factors for falls such as medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself on falls during duloxetine treatment is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including bone fractures and hospitalizations have been reported with duloxetine use <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.14">5.3</linkHtml>) and Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_6.1">6.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

There was no difference in the C<sub>max</sub>, but the AUC of duloxetine was somewhat (about 25%) higher and the half-life about 4 hours longer in the elderly females. Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the typical values for clearance decrease by approximately 1% for each year of age between 25 years to 75 years of age; but age as a predictive factor only accounts for a small percentage of between-patient variability. Dosage adjustment based on the age of the adult patient is not necessary.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Limited data are available on the effects of duloxetine in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). After a single 60 mg dose of duloxetine, C<sub>max</sub> and AUC values were approximately 100% greater in patients with ESRD receiving chronic intermittent hemodialysis than in subjects with normal renal function. The elimination half-life, however, was similar in both groups. The AUCs of the major circulating metabolites, 4-hydroxy duloxetine glucuronide and 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy duloxetine sulfate, largely excreted in urine, were approximately 7- to 9-fold higher and would be expected to increase further with multiple dosing. Population PK analyses suggest that mild to moderate degrees of renal impairment (estimated CrCl 30 to 80 mL/min) have no significant effect on duloxetine apparent clearance <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#Section_2.7">2.7</linkHtml>) and Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.3">5.14</linkHtml>)]</content>.<br/>

                        <paragraph>In animal studies, duloxetine did not demonstrate barbiturate-like (depressant) abuse potential.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>While duloxetine has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, there was no indication of drug-seeking behavior in the clinical trials. However, it is not possible to predict on the basis of premarketing experience the extent to which a CNS active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of duloxetine (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior).<br/>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>There is no specific antidote to a duloxetine overdosage, but if serotonin syndrome ensues, specific treatment (such as with cyproheptadine and/or temperature control) may be considered. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In case of acute overdose with duloxetine, treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdose with any drug, such as assuring an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation and monitoring cardiac rhythm and vital signs. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion or in symptomatic patients. Induction of emesis is not recommended.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption of duloxetine from the gastrointestinal tract. Administration of activated charcoal has been shown to decrease duloxetine AUC and C<sub>max</sub> by an average of one-third, although some patients had a limited effect of activated charcoal. Due to the large volume of distribution of duloxetine, forced diuresis, dialysis, hemoperfusion, and exchange transfusion are unlikely to be beneficial.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In managing overdose, the possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. A specific caution involves patients who overdose with duloxetine and tricyclic antidepressants. In such a case, decreased clearance of the parent tricyclic and/or its active metabolite may increase the possibility of clinically significant sequelae and extend the time needed for close medical observation <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.13">5.4</linkHtml>) and Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_7">7</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Consider contacting a poison control center (1-800-222-1222 or www.poison.org) for additional information on the treatment of overdosage.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Duloxetine has an elimination half-life of about 12 hours (range 8 hours to 17 hours) and its pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the therapeutic range. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved after 3 days of dosing. Elimination of duloxetine is mainly through hepatic metabolism involving two P450 isozymes, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>After oral duloxetine administration, duloxetine hydrochloride is well absorbed. There is a median 2 hours lag until absorption begins (T<sub>lag</sub>), with maximal plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) of duloxetine occurring 6 hours post dose. There is a 3 hours delay in absorption and a one-third increase in apparent clearance of duloxetine after an evening dose as compared to a morning dose. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Effect of Food: </content>Food does not affect the C<sub>max</sub> of duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 hours to 10 hours and it marginally decreases the extent of absorption (AUC) by about 10%.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The apparent volume of distribution averages about 1640 L. Duloxetine is highly bound (greater than 90%) to proteins in human plasma, binding primarily to albumin and α<sub>1</sub>-acid glycoprotein. The interaction between duloxetine and other highly protein bound drugs has not been fully evaluated. Plasma protein binding of duloxetine is not affected by renal or hepatic impairment. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Biotransformation and disposition of duloxetine in humans have been determined following oral administration of <sup>14</sup>C-labeled duloxetine. Duloxetine comprises about 3% of the total radiolabeled material in the plasma, indicating that it undergoes extensive metabolism to numerous metabolites. The major biotransformation pathways for duloxetine involve oxidation of the naphthyl ring followed by conjugation and further oxidation. Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 catalyze the oxidation of the naphthyl ring <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Metabolites found in plasma include 4-hydroxy duloxetine glucuronide and 5-hydroxy, 6-methoxy duloxetine sulfate. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Many additional metabolites have been identified in urine, some representing only minor pathways of elimination. Only trace (less than 1% of the dose) amounts of unchanged duloxetine are present in the urine. Most (about 70%) of the duloxetine dose appears in the urine as metabolites of duloxetine; about 20% is excreted in the feces. Duloxetine undergoes extensive metabolism, but the major circulating metabolites have not been shown to contribute significantly to the pharmacologic activity of duloxetine.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was established in 1 fixed-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and 2 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients between 18 years and 83 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Studies GAD-1, GAD-2, and GAD-3, respectively).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Studies GAD-1 and GAD-2, the starting dose was 60 mg once daily (down titration to 30 mg once daily was allowed for tolerability reasons; the dosage could be increased to 60 mg once daily). Fifteen percent of patients were down titrated. Study GAD-3 had a starting dose of 30 mg once daily for 1 week before increasing it to 60 mg once daily. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies GAD-2 and GAD-3 involved dose titration with duloxetine doses ranging from 60 mg once daily to 120 mg once daily (N=168 and N=162) compared to placebo (N=159 and N=161) over a 10-week treatment period. The mean dosage for completers at endpoint in these trials was 104.8 mg/day. Study GAD-1 evaluated duloxetine dosages of 60 mg once daily (N=168) and 120 mg once daily (N=170) compared to placebo (N=175) over a 9-week treatment period. While a 120 mg/day dose was shown to be effective, there is no evidence that doses greater than 60 mg/day confer additional benefit. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In all 3 trials, duloxetine demonstrated superiority over placebo as measured by greater improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) total score (see Table 8) and by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) global functional impairment score. The SDS is a composite measurement of the extent emotional symptoms disrupt patient functioning in 3 life domains: work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study GAD-4, 887 patients meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for GAD received duloxetine 60 mg to 120 mg once daily during an initial 26-week open-label treatment phase. Four hundred and twenty-nine patients who responded to open-label treatment [defined as meeting the following criteria at weeks 24 and 26: a decrease from baseline HAM-A total score by at least 50% to a score no higher than 11, and a Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-Improvement) score of 1 or 2] were randomly assigned to continuation of duloxetine at the same dosage (N=216) or to placebo (N=213) and were observed for relapse. Of the patients randomized, 73% had been in a responder status for at least 10 weeks. Relapse was defined as an increase in CGI-Severity score at least 2 points to a score greater than or equal to 4 and a MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) diagnosis of GAD (excluding duration), or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients taking duloxetine experienced a statistically significantly longer time to relapse of GAD than did patients taking placebo (see Figure 2). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age with GAD was established in one 10-week flexible-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults greater than or equal to 65 years of age meeting the DSM-IV criteria for GAD (Study GAD-5). In Study GAD-5, the starting dose was 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks before further dose increases in 30 mg increments at treatment weeks 2, 4, and 7 up to 120 mg once daily were allowed based on investigator judgment of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dosage for patients completing the 10-week acute treatment phase was 51 mg. Patients treated with duloxetine (N=151) demonstrated significantly greater improvement compared with placebo (N=140) on mean change from baseline to endpoint as measured by the HAM-A total score (see Table 8).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment of pediatric patients 7 years to 17 years of age with GAD was established in 1 flexible-dose randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric outpatients with GAD (based on DSM-IV criteria) (Study GAD-6).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study GAD-6, the starting dosage was 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Further dosage increases in 30 mg increments up to 120 mg once daily were allowed based on investigator judgment of clinical response and tolerability. The mean dosage for patients completing the 10-week treatment phase was 57.6 mg/day. In this study, duloxetine (N=135) demonstrated superiority over placebo (N=137) from baseline to endpoint as measured by greater improvement in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) for GAD severity score (see Table 9).</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of duloxetine for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy in adults was established in 2 randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials in adult patients having diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) for at least 6 months (Study DPNP-1 and Study DPNP-2). These trials enrolled a total of 791 patients of whom 592 (75%) completed the trials. Patients enrolled had Type I or II diabetes mellitus with a diagnosis of painful distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy for at least 6 months. The patients had a baseline pain score of greater than or equal to 4 on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Patients were permitted up to 4 grams of acetaminophen per day as needed for pain, in addition to duloxetine. Patients recorded their pain daily in a diary. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Both trials compared duloxetine 60 mg once daily or 60 mg twice daily with placebo. Study DPNP-1 additionally compared duloxetine 20 mg with placebo. A total of 457 patients (342 duloxetine, 115 placebo) were enrolled in Study DPNP-1 and a total of 334 patients (226 duloxetine, 108 placebo) were enrolled in Study DPNP-2. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with duloxetine 60 mg one or two times a day statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain scores from baseline and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain scores from baseline. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 3 and 4 show the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Studies DPNP-1 and DPNP-2, respectively. The figures are cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the trial.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of duloxetine for the management of fibromyalgia in adults was established in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials  in adult patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia (a history of widespread pain for 3 months, and pain present at 11 or more of the 18 specific tender point sites). Study FM-1 was three months in duration and enrolled female patients only. Study FM-2 was six months in duration and enrolled male and female patients. Approximately 25% of participants had a comorbid diagnosis of MDD. Studies FM-1 and FM-2 enrolled a total of 874 patients of whom 541 (62%) completed the trials. A total of 354 patients (234 duloxetine, 120 placebo) were enrolled in Study FM-1 and a total of 520 patients (376 duloxetine, 144 placebo) were enrolled in Study FM-2 (5% male, 95% female). The patients had a baseline pain score of 6.5 on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse possible pain). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies FM-1 and FM-2 compared duloxetine 60 mg once daily or 120 mg daily (given in divided doses in Study FM-1 and as a single daily dose in Study FM-2) with placebo. Study FM-2 additionally compared duloxetine 20 mg with placebo during the initial three months of a six-month trial.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Treatment with duloxetine 60 mg or 120 mg daily statistically significantly improved the endpoint mean pain scores from baseline and increased the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in pain score from baseline. Pain reduction was observed in patients both with and without comorbid MDD. However, the degree of pain reduction may be greater in patients with comorbid MDD. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 5 and 6 show the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Studies FM-1 and FM-2, respectively. The figures are cumulative so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as week 1, which persisted throughout the trial. Improvement was also demonstrated on measures of function (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaires) and patient global impression of change (PGI). Neither trial demonstrated a benefit of 120 mg compared to 60 mg, and a higher dosage was associated with more adverse reactions and premature discontinuations of treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Additionally, the benefit of up-titration in non-responders to duloxetine delayed-release capsules at 60 mg/day was evaluated in a separate trial (Study FM-3). Adult patients were initially treated with duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily for eight weeks in open-label fashion. Subsequently, completers of this phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules at either 60 mg once daily or 120 mg once daily. Responders were defined as patients who had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from baseline at the end of the 8 week treatment. Patients who were non-responders at 8 weeks were no more likely to meet response criteria at the end of 60 weeks of treatment if blindly titrated to duloxetine delayed-release capsules 120 mg as compared to those who were blindly continued on duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg.</paragraph>

                           <br/> Duloxetine was studied in 184 pediatric patients aged 13 years to 17 years with juvenile fibromyalgia syndrome in a 13-week, placebo-controlled trial (Study FM-4). In Study FM-4, 149 (81%) patients completed the trial. Duloxetine (N=91) was initiated at a dosage of 30 mg once daily for one week and titrated to 60 mg once daily for 12 weeks, as tolerated. The mean dosage for patients completing the 12-week treatment phase was 49 mg/day. Duloxetine showed improvement over placebo on the primary endpoint [change from baseline to end-of-treatment on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) – Modified Short Form: Adolescent Version 24-hour average pain severity rating] with a p-value of 0.052 from the prespecified primary analysis, and p-values ranging from 0.011 to 0.020 from sensitivity analyses which assigned baseline values to missing assessments of some patients who did not complete the trial for various reasons. The patients had a baseline BPI of 5.7. For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 7 shows the fraction of patients achieving that degree of improvement in Study FM-4.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults. This has been established in trials in adult patients with chronic low back pain and chronic pain due to osteoarthritis. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules in chronic low back pain (CLBP) in adults was assessed in two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of 13-weeks duration (Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-2), and one of 12-weeks duration (CLBP-3). Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-3 demonstrated efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules in the treatment of CLBP. Patients in all trials had no signs of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Study CLBP-1</content>: Two hundred thirty-six adult patients (N=115 on duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=121 on placebo) enrolled and 182 (77%) completed 13-week treatment phase. After 7 weeks of treatment, duloxetine-treated patients with less than 30% reduction in average daily pain and who were able to tolerate 60 mg once daily had their duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosage, in a double-blinded fashion, increased to 120 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 13 weeks of treatment, patients taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg to 120 mg daily had a significantly greater pain reduction compared to patients taking placebo. Randomization was stratified by the patients’ baseline NSAIDs use status. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were differences in treatment outcomes as a function of NSAIDs use. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Study CLBP-2</content>: Four hundred and four patients were randomized to receive fixed dosages of duloxetine delayed-release capsules daily or a matching placebo (N=59 on duloxetine delayed-release capsules 20 mg, N=116 on duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg, N=112 on duloxetine delayed-release capsules 120 mg, N=117 on placebo) and 267 (66%) completed the entire 13-week trial. After 13 weeks of treatment, none of the three duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages showed a statistically significant difference in pain reduction compared to placebo. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Study CLBP-3</content>: Four hundred and one patients were randomized to receive fixed doses of duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg daily or placebo (N=198 on duloxetine delayed-release capsules, N=203 on placebo), and 303 (76%) completed the trial. Patients had a mean baseline pain rating of 6 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). After 12 weeks of treatment, patients taking duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg daily had significantly greater pain reduction compared to patients taking placebo. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>For various degrees of improvement in pain from baseline to study endpoint, Figures 8 and 9 show the fraction of patients in Studies CLBP-1 and CLBP-3 achieving that degree of improvement, respectively. The figures are cumulative, so that patients whose change from baseline is, for example, 50%, are also included at every level of improvement below 50%. Patients who did not complete the trial were assigned the value of 0% improvement.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of duloxetine delayed-release capsules in chronic pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) in adults was assessed in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of 13-weeks duration (Study OA-1 and Study OA-2). All patients in both trials fulfilled the ACR clinical and radiographic criteria for classification of idiopathic OA of the knee. Randomization was stratified by the patients’ baseline NSAIDs-use status. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients assigned to duloxetine delayed-release capsules started treatment in both trials at a dose of 30 mg once daily for one week. After the first week, the dose of duloxetine delayed-release capsules was increased to 60 mg once daily. After 7 weeks of treatment with duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily, in Study OA-1 patients with sub-optimal response to treatment (less than 30% pain reduction) and tolerated duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily had their doseincreased to 120 mg. However, in Study OA-2, all patients, regardless of their response to treatment after 7 weeks, were re-randomized to either continue receiving duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg once daily or have their dosage increased to 120 mg once daily for the remainder of the trial. Patients in the placebo treatment groups in both trials received a matching placebo for the entire duration of trials. For both trials, efficacy analyses were conducted using 13-week data from the combined duloxetine delayed-release capsules 60 mg and 120 mg once daily treatment groups compared to the placebo group.</paragraph>
