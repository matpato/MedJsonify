Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including dextroamphetamine sulfate, can result in overdose and death (see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_4def31a7-af53-4eef-ae80-5add893a7fc9">OVERDOSAGE</linkHtml>), and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.<br/>
                     <br/>Before prescribing dextroamphetamine sulfate, assess each patientâs risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks, proper storage of the drug, and proper disposal of any unused drug. Throughout dextroamphetamine sulfate treatment, reassess each patientâs risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction (see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2fee12d9-2c9c-4a56-87b4-2729fa546099">WARNINGS</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_39ca51a8-75bb-4faf-866b-e8d97764e1b3">DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE</linkHtml>).</content>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph> Dextroamphetamine sulfate has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of dextroamphetamine sulfate exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Dextroamphetamine sulfate can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution (see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_39ca51a8-75bb-4faf-866b-e8d97764e1b3">DRUG ABUSE and DEPENDENCE</linkHtml>). Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including dextroamphetamine sulfate, can result in overdose and death (see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_4def31a7-af53-4eef-ae80-5add893a7fc9">OVERDOSAGE</linkHtml>), and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Before prescribing dextroamphetamine sulfate, assess each patientâs risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store amphetamine sulfate in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give dextroamphetamine sulfate to anyone else. Throughout dextroamphetamine sulfate treatment, reassess each patientâs risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms: CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients.

                     <content styleCode="underline">MAO Inhibitors</content> - MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. A variety of neurological toxic effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dextroamphetamine sulfate has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction (see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2fee12d9-2c9c-4a56-87b4-2729fa546099">WARNINGS</linkHtml>). Dextroamphetamine sulfate can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Misuse and abuse of amphetamines may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Dextroamphetamine sulfate, can result in overdose and death (see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_4def31a7-af53-4eef-ae80-5add893a7fc9">OVERDOSAGE</linkHtml>), and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dextroamphetamine sulfate may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including Dextroamphetamine sulfate include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tolerance</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Dextroamphetamine sulfate may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).</paragraph>
