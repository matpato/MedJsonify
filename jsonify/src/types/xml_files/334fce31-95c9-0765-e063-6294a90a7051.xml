                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In post marketing experience, abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets has resulted in clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension above baseline levels and increases in heart rate. Hypertensive encephalopathy has also been reported in association with rebound hypertension with both guanfacine extended-release tablets and immediate release guanfacine
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Adverse Reactions (
  
   <linkHtml href="#_e75957de-dbe3-3abb-eb46-c716fc4c743d">6.2</linkHtml>)]
 
  </content>. In these cases, high-dosage guanfacine was discontinued; concomitant stimulant use was also reported, which may potentially increase hypertensive response upon abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine. Children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting, and a resulting inability to take medications, so they may be especially at risk for rebound hypertension.  

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days
 
  <content styleCode="italics">[see Dosage and Administration (
  
   <linkHtml href="#splSection30">2.5</linkHtml>)]
 
  </content>. Blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing guanfacine extended-release tablets. If abrupt discontinuation occurs (especially with concomitant stimulant use), patients should be closely followed for rebound hypertension.

                        <paragraph>In the monotherapy pediatric, short-term, controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2), the maximum mean changes from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were −5.4 mmHg, −3.4 mmHg, and −5.5 bpm, respectively, for all doses combined (generally one week after reaching target doses). For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8 bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the guanfacine extended-release tablets group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine extended-release tablets as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open-label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies.</paragraph>

  <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Studies (
  
   <linkHtml href="#splSectionPLRClinicalStudies">14</linkHtml>)]
 
  </content>, increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaging approximately 3 mmHg and increases in heart rate averaging 5 beats per minute above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation with tapering of guanfacine extended-release tablets. In a maintenance of efficacy study, increases in blood pressure and heart rate above baseline slowly diminished over the follow up period, which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose; the estimated average time to return to baseline was between six and twelve months. In this study, the increases in blood pressure and pulse were not considered serious or associated with adverse events. However, individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes.

                        <paragraph>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADHD medications, including guanfacine extended-release tablets, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for ADHD Medications at 1-866-961-2388.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Risk Summary</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Available data with guanfacine over decades of use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, use of guanfacine in pregnant women over this time has been infrequent. In animal reproduction studies, rabbits and rats exposed to 3 and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively, showed no adverse outcomes. However, higher doses were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity (see Data).  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Reproduction studies conducted in rats have shown that guanfacine crosses the placenta. However, administration of guanfacine to rabbits and rats during organogenesis at 3 (rabbit) and 4 (rat) times the MRHD of 0.12 mg/kg/day on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis resulted in no evidence of harm to the fetus. Higher doses (13.5 times the MRHD in both rabbits and rats) were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity.

                        <paragraph>There are no data on the presence of guanfacine in human milk or the effects on the breastfed infant. The effects on milk production are also unknown. Guanfacine is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). If a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. If an infant is exposed to guanfacine through breastmilk, monitor for symptoms of hypotension and bradycardia such as sedation, lethargy and poor feeding (see Clinical Considerations). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for guanfacine extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from guanfacine extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Clinical Considerations</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor breastfeeding infants exposed to guanfacine through breastmilk for sedation, lethargy, and poor feeding.  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Data</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Guanfacine was excreted in breast milk of lactating rats at a concentration comparable to that observed in blood, but slightly less than the concentration in plasma when administered following a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Safety and efficacy of guanfacine extended-release tablets in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age have not been established. The efficacy of guanfacine extended-release tablets was studied for the treatment of ADHD in five controlled monotherapy clinical trials (up to 15 weeks in duration), one randomized withdrawal study and one controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants (8 weeks in duration) in children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 who met DSM-IV

                        <paragraph>In studies in juvenile rats, guanfacine alone produced a slight delay in sexual maturation in males and females at 2 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate produced a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased growth as measured by a decrease in bone length in males at a dose of guanfacine comparable to the MRHD and a dose of methylphenidate approximately 4 times the MRHD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine alone from 7 to 59 days of age, development was delayed as indicated by a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased body weight gain in males at 2 mg/kg/day and in females at 3 mg/kg/day. The No Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for delayed sexual maturation was 1 mg/kg/day, which is equivalent to the MRHD of 4 mg/day, on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis. The effects on fertility were not evaluated in this study.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate from 7 to 59 days of age, a decrease in ulna bone length and a slight delay in sexual maturation were observed in males given 1 mg/kg/day of guanfacine in combination with 50 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate. The NOAELs for these findings were 0.3 mg/kg of guanfacine in combination with 16 mg/kg/day of methylphenidate, which are equivalent to 0.3 and 1.4 times the MRHD of 4 mg/day and 54 mg/day for guanfacine and methylphenidate, respectively, on a mg/m
 
  <sup>2</sup>basis. These findings were not observed with guanfacine alone at 1 mg/kg/day or methylphenidate alone at 50 mg/kg/day.

                        <paragraph>Guanfacine is a selective central alpha
 
  <sub>2A</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist in that it has a 15 to 20 times higher affinity for this receptor subtype than for the alpha
 
  <sub>2B</sub>or alpha
 
  <sub>2C</sub>subtypes.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Guanfacine is a known antihypertensive agent. By stimulating central alpha
 
  <sub>2A</sub>-adrenergic receptors, guanfacine reduces sympathetic nerve impulses from the vasomotor center to the heart and blood vessels. This results in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction in heart rate.

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a thorough QT study, the administration of two dose levels of immediate-release guanfacine (4 mg and 8 mg) produced concentrations approximately 2 to 4 times the concentrations observed with the maximum recommended dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets of 0.12 mg/kg. Guanfacine was not shown to prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Guanfacine is readily absorbed and approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins independent of drug concentration. After oral administration of guanfacine extended-release tablets the time to peak plasma concentration is approximately 5 hours in children and adolescents with ADHD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Immediate-release and extended-release guanfacine have different pharmacokinetic characteristics; dose substitution on a milligram per milligram basis will result in differences in exposure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A comparison across studies suggests that the C
 
  <sub>max</sub>is 60% lower and AUC
 
  <sub>0-∞</sub>43% lower, respectively, for the extended-release compared to immediate-release guanfacine. Therefore, the relative bioavailability of the extended-release to immediate-release guanfacine is 58%. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters in adults following the administration of guanfacine extended-release tablets 1 mg once daily and immediate-release guanfacine 1mg once daily are summarized in Table 15.

In pooled human hepatic microsomes, guanfacine did not inhibit the activities of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4/5); guanfacine is also not an inducer of CYP3A, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6. Guanfacine is a substrate of CYP3A4/5 and exposure is affected by CYP3A4/5 inducers/inhibitors.

Guanfacine is a substrate of OCT1 and OCT2, but not BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2. Concomitant administration of guanfacine with OCT1 substrates might potentially increase the exposure of these OCT1 substrates.</paragraph>

In adult patients with impaired renal function, the cumulative urinary excretion of guanfacine and the renal clearance diminished as renal function decreased. In patients on hemodialysis, the dialysis clearance was about 15% of the total clearance.

                  <paragraph>Study 1 (301 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with guanfacine extended-release tablets (2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg) was evaluated for 5 weeks (n=345) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. Study 2 (304 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study, in which efficacy of once daily dosing with guanfacine extended-release tablets (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg) was evaluated for 6 weeks (n=324) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years. In both studies, randomized patients in 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg dose groups were titrated to their target fixed dose, and continued on the same dose until a dose tapering phase started. The lowest dose of 1 mg used in Study 2 was not randomized to patients weighing more than 50 kg. Patients who weighed less than 25 kg were not included in either study. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering (up to Week 5 in Study 1 and up to Week 6 in Study 2).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for guanfacine extended-release tablets compared to placebo for Studies 1 and 2. Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline were statistically significant for each of the 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets randomized treatment groups in both studies, as well as the 1 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets treatment group that was included only in Study 2 (see Table 16). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Dose-responsive efficacy was evident, particularly when data were examined on a weight-adjusted (mg/kg) basis. When evaluated over the dose range of 0.01 to 0.17 mg/kg/day, clinically relevant improvements were observed beginning at doses in the range 0.05 to 0.08 mg/kg/day. Doses up to 0.12 mg/kg/day were shown to provide additional benefit.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In the monotherapy trials (Studies 1 and 2), subgroup analyses were performed to identify any differences in response based on gender or age (6 to 12 vs. 13 to 17). Analyses of the primary outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender. Analyses by age revealed a statistically significant treatment effect only in the 6 to 12 age subgroup. Due to the relatively small proportion of adolescent patients (ages 13 to 17) enrolled into these studies (approximately 25%), these data may not have been sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in the adolescent patients. In these studies, patients were randomized to a fixed dose of guanfacine extended-release tablets rather than optimized by body weight. Therefore, some adolescent patients were randomized to a dose that might have resulted in relatively lower plasma guanfacine concentrations compared to the younger patients. Over half (55%) of the adolescent patients received doses of 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg. In studies in which systematic pharmacokinetic data were obtained, there was a strong inverse correlation between body weight and plasma guanfacine concentrations.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 3 (313 study) was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, in which efficacy of once daily optimized dosing (morning or evening) with guanfacine extended-release tablets (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 mg), when co-administered with psychostimulants, was evaluated for 8 weeks, in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD, with a sub-optimal response to stimulants (n=455). Patients were started at the 1 mg guanfacine extended-release tablets dose level and were titrated weekly over a 5-week dose-optimization period to an optimal guanfacine extended-release tablets dose not to exceed 4 mg/day based on tolerability and clinical response. The dose was then maintained for a 3-week dose maintenance period before entry to 1 week of dose tapering. Patients took guanfacine extended-release tablets either in the morning or the evening while maintaining their current dose of psychostimulant treatment given each morning. Allowable psychostimulants in the study were ADDERALL XR
 
  <sup>®</sup>, VYVANSE
 
  <sup>®</sup>, CONCERTA
 
  <sup>®</sup>,  FOCALIN XR
 
  <sup>®</sup>, RITALIN LA
 
  <sup>®</sup>, METADATE CD
 
  <sup>®</sup> or FDA-approved generic equivalents. 

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a weekly basis by clinicians using the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV), which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week prior to dose tapering for which a valid score was obtained (up to Week 8).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Mean reductions in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for guanfacine extended-release tablets given in combination with a psychostimulant compared to placebo given with a psychostimulant for Study 3, for both morning and evening guanfacine extended-release tablets dosing (see Table 17). Nearly two-thirds (64.2%) of patients reached optimal doses in the 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day range. </paragraph>

Patients receiving guanfacine extended-release tablets showed statistically significantly greater improvement on the ADHD-RS-IV total score compared with patients receiving placebo (see Table 17).  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 6 (316 study) was a 12-week (for children aged 6 to 12) or 15-week (for adolescents aged 13 to 17), randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-reference, dose-optimization study conducted in pediatric patients (children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old inclusive) (n=337) to assess the efficacy and safety of once-daily dosing (children: 1 to 4 mg/day, adolescents: 1 to 7 mg/day; optimized dose range of 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of ADHD. Guanfacine extended-release tablets were statistically superior to placebo on symptoms of ADHD in patients 6 to 17 years as measured by change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV total scores (see Table 17).</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Study 7 (315 study) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD. The study consisted of an open-label phase, including a 7-week dose optimization period to titrate patients to an optimal dose (maximum 4 mg/day for children and 7 mg/day for adolescents; optimized dose range: 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day) and a 6-week dose maintenance period. There were 526 patients included in the open-label phase. Among those, 315 patients who met response criteria in the open-label phase were then randomized (1:1, guanfacine extended-release tablets:placebo) in a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase. The response criteria were defined by ≥30% reduction in ADHD-RS-IV total score and a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score of 1 or 2 during the open-label phase. A statistically significantly lower proportion of treatment failures occurred among guanfacine extended-release tablets patients compared to placebo at the end of the randomized withdrawal period (Figure 4). Treatment failure was defined as a ≥50% increase (worsening) in ADHD-RS-IV total score and a ≥2-point increase in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score. Patients who met the treatment failure criteria on two consecutive visits or discontinued for any reason were classified as treatment failure.</paragraph>
