                        <paragraph>Before prescribing dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules to anyone else. Throughout Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules treatment, reassess each patient’s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules should be discontinued. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>CNS stimulants, including dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports and at the therapeutic dosage of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or discontinuation of the CNS stimulant. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules treatment.  Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as MAOIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John’s Wort<content styleCode="italics"> [see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_574822b1-5cbb-4a54-8130-dfbc5201eb52">7.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. Amphetamines and amphetamine derivatives are known to be metabolized, to some degree, by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and display minor inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#ID_40135fe1-64e5-4464-ae61-715ed1564e2b">12.3</linkHtml>)]</content>. The potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction exists with the coadministration of CYP2D6 inhibitors which may increase the risk with increased exposure to dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules. In these situations, consider an alternative nonserotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_574822b1-5cbb-4a54-8130-dfbc5201eb52">7.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules with MAOI drugs is contraindicated <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID_71ac4cef-253b-4627-94c9-3d4f6f4b6ec1">4</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Discontinue treatment with dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. Concomitant use of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. If clinically warranted, consider initiating dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules with lower doses, monitoring patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and informing patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The premarketing development program for dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules included exposures in a total of 1,315 participants in clinical trials (635 pediatric patients, 350 adolescent patients, 248 adult patients, and 82 healthy adult subjects). Of these, 635 patients (ages 6 to 12) were evaluated in two controlled clinical studies, one open-label clinical study, and two single-dose clinical pharmacology studies  (N= 40). Safety data on all patients are included in the discussion that follows. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and listings that follow, COSTART terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed.</paragraph>

                           </content>In two placebo-controlled studies of up to 5 weeks duration among children with ADHD, 2.4% (10/425) of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions (including three patients with loss of appetite, one of whom also reported insomnia) compared to 2.7% (7/259) receiving placebo. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules in controlled and uncontrolled, multiple-dose clinical trials of children (N=595) were anorexia (loss of appetite) (2.9%), insomnia (1.5%), weight loss (1.2%), emotional lability (1%), and depression (0.7%). Over half of these patients were exposed to dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules for 12 months or more. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a separate placebo-controlled 4-week study in adolescents with ADHD, five patients (2.1%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients (N=233) compared to none who received placebo (N=54). The most frequent adverse event leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) was insomnia (1.3%, n=3). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In one placebo-controlled 4-week study among adults with ADHD with doses 20 to 60 mg, 23 patients (12.0%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients (N=191) compared to one patient (1.6%) who received placebo (N=64). The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e. leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (5.2%, n=10), anxiety (2.1%, n=4), nervousness (1.6%, n=3), dry mouth (1.6%, n=3), anorexia (1.6%, n=3), tachycardia (1.6%, n=3), headache (1.6%, n=3), and asthenia (1.0%, n=2). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>No apparent effects on morphological development were observed in embryo-fetal development studies, with oral administration of amphetamine to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 2 and 12 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day given to adolescents, on a mg/m<sup>2 </sup>basis. However, in a pre- and postnatal development study, amphetamine (<content styleCode="italics">d- </content>to <content styleCode="italics">l- </content>ratio of 3:1) administered orally to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation caused a decrease in pup survival and a decrease in pup body weight that correlated with a delay in developmental landmarks at clinically relevant doses of amphetamine. In addition, adverse effects on reproductive performance were observed in pups whose mothers were treated with amphetamine. Long-term neurochemical and behavioral effects have also been reported in animal developmental studies using clinically relevant doses of amphetamine <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

Fetal malformations and death have been reported in mice following parenteral administration of <content styleCode="italics">d-</content>amphetamine doses of 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) or greater to pregnant animals. Administration of these doses was also associated with severe maternal toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A study was conducted in which pregnant rats received daily oral doses of amphetamine (<content styleCode="italics">d-</content> to <content styleCode="italics">l-</content> enantiomer ratio of 3:1) of 2, 6, and 10 mg/kg from gestation Day 6 to lactation Day 20. These doses are approximately 0.8, 2, and 4 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day given to adolescents, on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. All doses caused hyperactivity and decreased weight gain in the dams. A decrease in pup survival was seen at all doses. A decrease in pup body weight was seen at 6 and 10 mg/kg which correlated with delays in developmental landmarks, such as preputial separation and vaginal opening. Increased pup locomotor activity was seen at 10 mg/kg on Day 22 postpartum but not at 5 weeks postweaning. When pups were tested for reproductive performance at maturation, gestational weight gain, number of implantations, and number of delivered pups were decreased in the group whose mothers had been given 10 mg/kg.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A number of studies from the literature in rodents indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to amphetamine (<content styleCode="italics">d-</content> or <content styleCode="italics">d,l-</content>) at doses similar to those used clinically can result in long-term neurochemical and behavioral alterations. Reported behavioral effects include learning and memory deficits, altered locomotor activity, and changes in sexual function.</paragraph>

                           </content>Based on limited case reports in published literature, amphetamine (<content styleCode="italics">d- </content>or <content styleCode="italics">d</content>, <content styleCode="italics">l-</content>) is present in human milk, at relative infant doses of 2 to 13.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 1.9 and 7.5. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant. Long-term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from amphetamine exposure are unknown. It is possible that large dosages of amphetamine might interfere with milk production, especially in women whose lactation is not well established. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules contain mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine, a CNS stimulant. Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules contain equal amounts (by weight) of four salts: dextroamphetamine sulfate, amphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate and amphetamine (D,L)-aspartate monohydrate. This results in a 3.1:1 mixture of dextro- to levo- amphetamine base equivalent.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg and 30 mg strength extended release capsules are for oral administration. Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules contain drug-containing beads, which prolong the release of amphetamine compared to the dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate (immediate-release) tablet formulation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pharmacokinetic studies of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules have been conducted in healthy adult and pediatric (children aged 6 to 12 yrs) subjects, adolescent (13 to 17 yrs) and children with ADHD. Both dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate (immediate-release) tablets and dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules contain d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine salts in the ratio of 3:1. Following administration of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate tablets (immediate-release), the peak plasma concentrations occurred in about 3 hours for both d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) for dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules is about 7 hours, which is about 4 hours longer compared to dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate tablets (immediate-release). This is consistent with the extended-release nature of the product.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A single dose of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate 20 mg extended-release capsules provided comparable plasma concentration profiles of both d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine to dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate tablets (immediate-release) 10 mg twice daily administered 4 hours apart.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The mean elimination half-life for d-amphetamine is 10 hours in adults; 11 hours in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years and weighing less than or equal to 75 kg/165 lbs; and 9 hours in children aged 6 to 12 years. For the l-amphetamine, the mean elimination half-life in adults is 13 hours; 13 to 14 hours in adolescents; and 11 hours in children aged 6 to 12 years. On a mg/kg body weight basis, children have a higher clearance than adolescents or adults (see <content styleCode="italics">Special Populations</content> below).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules demonstrate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 20 to 60 mg in adults and adolescents weighing greater than 75 kg/165 lbs, over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg in adolescents weighing less than or equal to 75 kg/165 lbs, and 5 to 30 mg in children aged 6 to 12 years. There is no unexpected accumulation at steady state in children.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Food does not affect the extent of absorption of d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine, but prolongs T<sub>max </sub>by 2.5 hours (from 5.2 hrs at fasted state to 7.7 hrs after a high-fat meal) for d-amphetamine and 2.7 hours (from 5.6 hrs at fasted state to 8.3 hrs after a high-fat meal) for l-amphetamine after administration of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules 30 mg. Opening the capsule and sprinkling the contents on applesauce results in comparable absorption to the intact capsule taken in the fasted state. Equal doses of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule strengths are bioequivalent. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Metabolism and Excretion<br/>
                           </content>Amphetamine is reported to be oxidized at the 4 position of the benzene ring to form 4-hydroxyamphetamine, or on the side chain α or β carbons to form alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine or norephedrine, respectively.  Norephedrine and 4-hydroxy-amphetamine are both active and each is subsequently oxidized to form 4-hydroxy-norephedrine. Alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine undergoes deamination to form phenylacetone, which ultimately forms benzoic acid and its glucuronide and the glycine conjugate hippuric acid. Although the enzymes involved in amphetamine metabolism have not been clearly defined, CYP2D6 is known to be involved with formation of 4-hydroxy-amphetamine. Since CYP2D6 is genetically polymorphic, population variations in amphetamine metabolism are a possibility. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Amphetamine is known to inhibit monoamine oxidase, whereas the ability of amphetamine and its metabolites to inhibit various P450 isozymes and other enzymes has not been adequately elucidated. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> experiments with human microsomes indicate minor inhibition of CYP2D6 by amphetamine and minor inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 by one or more metabolites. However, due to the probability of auto-inhibition and the lack of information on the concentration of these metabolites relative to <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> concentrations, no predications regarding the potential for amphetamine or its metabolites to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs by CYP isozymes <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> can be made. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>With normal urine pHs, approximately half of an administered dose of amphetamine is recoverable in urine as derivatives of alpha-hydroxy-amphetamine and approximately another 30 to 40% of the dose is recoverable in urine as amphetamine itself. Since amphetamine has a pKa of 9.9, urinary recovery of amphetamine is highly dependent on pH and urine flow rates. Alkaline urine pHs result in less ionization and reduced renal elimination, and acidic pHs and high flow rates result in increased renal elimination with clearances greater than glomerular filtration rates, indicating the involvement of active secretion. Urinary recovery of amphetamine has been reported to range from 1 to 75%, depending on urinary pH, with the remaining fraction of the dose hepatically metabolized. Consequently, both hepatic and renal dysfunction have the potential to inhibit the elimination of amphetamine and result in prolonged exposures.  In addition, drugs that effect urinary pH are known to alter the elimination of amphetamine, and any decrease in amphetamine’s metabolism that might occur due to drug interactions or genetic polymorphisms is more likely to be clinically significant when renal elimination is decreased <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID_698950fc-d308-4631-97ee-18d5cf0b69c5">7</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>

Systemic exposure measured by area under the curve to infinity (AUC<sub>∞</sub>) and maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) decreased with increases in body weight, while oral volume of distribution (V<sub>Z</sub>/F), oral clearance (CL/F), and elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) increased with increases in body weight. </paragraph>

However, children had higher systemic exposure to amphetamine (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC) than adults for a given dose of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, which was attributed to the higher dose administered to children on a mg/kg body weight basis compared to adults.

Patients were randomized to fixed-dose treatment groups receiving final doses of 10, 20, or 30 mg of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules or placebo once daily in the morning for three weeks. Significant improvements in patient behavior, based upon teacher ratings of attention and hyperactivity, were observed for all dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule doses compared to patients who received placebo, for all three weeks, including the first week of treatment, when all dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule subjects were receiving a dose of 10 mg/day.  Patients who received dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules showed behavioral improvements in both morning and afternoon assessments compared to patients on placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a classroom analogue study, patients (N=51) receiving fixed doses of 10, 20, or 30 mg dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules demonstrated statistically significant improvements in teacher-rated behavior and performance measures, compared to patients treated with placebo.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study was conducted in adolescents aged 13-17 (N=327) who met DSM-IV<sup>®</sup> criteria for ADHD. The primary cohort of patients (n=287, weighing ≤ 75kg/165 lbs) were randomized to fixed-dose treatment groups and received four weeks of treatment. Patients were randomized to receive final doses of 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules or placebo once daily in the morning. Patients randomized to doses greater than 10 mg were titrated to their final doses by 10 mg each week. The secondary cohort consisted of 40 subjects weighing &gt;75 kg/165 lbs who were randomized to fixed-dose treatment groups receiving final doses of 50 and 60 mg dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules or placebo once daily in the morning for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) total score for the primary cohort. The ADHD-RS-IV is an 18-item scale that measures the core symptoms of ADHD. Improvements in the primary cohort were statistically significantly greater in all four primary cohort active treatment groups (dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg) compared with the placebo group.
