                  <paragraph>Ampicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids. However, penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain occurs only when the meninges are inflamed. Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid. Due to maturational changes in renal function, ampicillin half-life decreases as postmenstrual age (a sum of gestational age and postnatal age) increases for infants with postnatal age of less than 28 days. The active form appears in the bile in higher concentrations than those found in serum. Ampicillin is the least serum-bound of all the penicillins, averaging about 20% compared to approximately 60 to 90% for other penicillins. Ampicillin is well-tolerated by most patients and has been given in doses of 2 grams daily for many weeks without adverse reactions.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed.

A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin for injection and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There have been well-documented reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity reactions who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions when treated with a cephalosporin. Before initiating therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.</paragraph>

In most cases, the rash is maculopapular, pruritic, and generalized. Therefore, the administration of ampicillin is not recommended in patients with mononucleosis. It is not known whether these patients are truly allergic to ampicillin.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Prescribing ampicillin for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ampicillin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ampicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ampicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Skin rashes and urticaria have been reported frequently. A few cases of exfoliative dermatitis and erythema multiforme have been Linear IgA bullous dermatosis has been reported. Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>
                     <content styleCode="bold">Note:</content>Urticaria, other skin rashes, and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued, unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is lifethreatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Serious anaphylactic reactions require the immediate use of epinephrine, oxygen, and intravenous steroids.

                     <content styleCode="bold">Liver</content>– A moderate rise in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) has been noted, particularly in infants, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Mild transitory SGOT elevations have been observed in individuals receiving larger (two to four times) than usual and oft-repeated intramuscular injections. Evidence indicates that glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) is released at the site of intramuscular injection of ampicillin sodium and that the presence of increased amounts of this enzyme in the blood does not necessarily indicate liver involvement.

These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.

  <content styleCode="bold">ONE hour</content>at room temperature.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>b) Dilute further within

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>c) Using aseptic technique under a laminar flow hood, the closure should be penetrated only one time after reconstitution using a suitable sterile dispensing set; which allows measured dispensing of the contents. Use of a syringe and needle is not recommended as it may cause leakage.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>d) After entry, use entire contents of bottle promptly. The entire contents of the Pharmacy Bulk Package must be dispensed within
 
  <content styleCode="bold">ONE hour</content>of reconstitution. This time limit should begin with the introduction of solvent or diluent into the Pharmacy Bulk Package.

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>e) An integral hanger attached to the pharmacy bulk package provides a suitable hanging device while dispensing contents. Use of this product is restricted to a suitable work area, such as a laminar flow hood. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.</paragraph>
