                        <paragraph>Complex behaviors such as “sleep-driving” (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with hypnotics. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as “sleep-driving” may occur with hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of doxepin should be strongly considered for patients who report a “sleep-driving” episode. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a hypnotic. As with “sleep-driving”, patients usually do not remember these events. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics. 
  <br/>  Doxepin, the active ingredient in doxepin tablets, is an antidepressant at doses 10- to 100-fold higher than in doxepin. Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Risk from the lower dose of doxepin in doxepin tablets can not be excluded. 
  <br/>  It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.

                     <text>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>The pre-marketing development program for doxepin tablets included doxepin HCl exposures in 1017 subjects (580 insomnia patients and 437 healthy subjects) from 12 studies conducted in the United States. 863 of these subjects (580 insomnia patients and 283 healthy subjects) participated in six randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy studies with doxepin doses of 1 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg for up to 3-months in duration. 
  <br/>  Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. However, data from the doxepin studies provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to adverse reaction incidence rates in the populations studied. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment</content>
                           <br/>  The percentage of subjects discontinuing Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for an adverse reaction was 0.6% in the placebo group compared to 0.4%, 1.0%, and 0.7% in the doxepin 1 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg groups, respectively. No reaction that resulted in discontinuation occurred at a rate greater than 0.5%. 
  <br/>  Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of ≥ 2% in Controlled Trials 
  <br/>  Table 1 shows the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions from three long-term (28 to 85 days) placebo-controlled studies of doxepin in adult (N=221) and elderly (N=494) subjects with chronic insomnia. 
  <br/>  Reactions reported by Investigators were classified using a modified MedDRA dictionary of preferred terms for purposes of establishing incidence. The table includes only reactions that occurred in 2% or more of subjects who received doxepin 3 mg or 6 mg in which the incidence in subjects treated with doxepin was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated subjects.

                           <br/>  Five randomized, placebo-controlled studies in adults and the elderly assessed next-day psychomotor function within 1 hour of awakening utilizing the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying test (SCT), and visual analog scale (VAS) for sleepiness, following night time administration of doxepin. 
  <br/>  In a one-night, double-blind study conducted in 565 healthy adult subjects experiencing transient insomnia, doxepin 6 mg showed modest negative changes in SCT and VAS. 
  <br/>  In a 35-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of doxepin 3 and 6 mg in 221 adults with chronic insomnia, small decreases in the DSST and SCT occurred in the 6 mg group. 
  <br/>  In a 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in 240 elderly subjects with chronic insomnia, doxepin 1 mg and 3 mg was comparable to placebo on DSST, SCT, and VAS.

                        <paragraph>Doxepin was administered to 1017 subjects in clinical trials in the United States. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions recorded by clinical investigators were standardized using a modified MedDRA dictionary of preferred terms. The following is a list of MedDRA terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by subjects treated with doxepin. 
  <br/>  Adverse reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions:
 
  <content styleCode="bold">Frequent</content>adverse reactions are those that occurred on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 subjects;
 
  <content styleCode="bold">Infrequent</content>adverse reactions are those that occurred in fewer than 1/100 subjects and more than 1/1000 subjects.

  <content styleCode="italics">(see Clinical Considerations).</content>In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of doxepin to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at doses 65 and 23 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 6 mg/day based on AUC, respectively. Oral administration of doxepin to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased pup survival and a delay in pup growth at doses 60 times the MRHD based on AUC

                           <br/>  The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

                           <br/>  Neonates exposed to TCAs, including doxepin, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either direct toxic effects of TCAs or possibly a drug discontinuation syndrome. Monitor neonates who were exposed to doxepin in the third trimester of pregnancy for poor neonatal adaptation syndrome.

                           <br/>  Published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to TCAs, including doxepin, have not established an association with major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal outcomes. Methodological limitations of these observational studies include small sample size and lack of adequate controls. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Animal Data</content>
                           <br/>  When doxepin (30, 100, and 150 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis, developmental toxicity (increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities consisting of non-ossified bones in the skull and sternum and decreased fetal body weights) and maternal toxicity were noted at ≥100 mg/kg/day, which produced plasma exposures (AUCs) of doxepin and nordoxepin (the primary metabolite in humans) approximately 65 and 53 times, respectively, the plasma AUCs at the MRHD. The plasma exposures at the no-effect dose for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity in rats (30 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 5 times the plasma AUCs for doxepin and nordoxepin, respectively, at the MRHD. When doxepin (10, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis, fetal body weights were reduced at the highest dose in the absence of maternal toxicity, which produced plasma AUCs of doxepin and nordoxepin approximately 23 and 56 times, respectively, the plasma AUCs at the MRHD. The plasma exposures at the no-effect dose for developmental effects (30 mg/kg/day) are approximately 8 and 25 times the plasma AUCs for doxepin and nordoxepin, respectively, at the MRHD. Oral administration of doxepin (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day) to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased pup survival and transient growth delay at the highest dose, which produced plasma AUCs of doxepin and nordoxepin approximately 60 and 39 times, respectively, the plasma AUCs at the MRHD. The plasma exposures at the no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre-and postnatal development in rats (30 mg/kg/day) are approximately 2 and 1 times the plasma AUCs for doxepin and nordoxepin, respectively, at the MRHD.

                           <br/>  Data from the published literature report the presence of doxepin and nordoxepin in human milk. There are reports of excess sedation, respiratory depression, poor sucking and swallowing, and hypotonia in breastfed infants exposed to doxepin. There are no data on the effects of doxepin on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, clinicians should advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with doxepin. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Clinical Considerations</content>
                           <br/>  Infants exposed to doxepin through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation, respiratory depression and hypotonia.

                     <title>10.3 Recommended Management</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. In addition, the possibility of a multiple drug ingestion should be considered. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  If an overdose is suspected, an ECG should be obtained and cardiac monitoring should be initiated immediately. The patient’s airway should be protected, an intravenous line should be established, and gastric decontamination should be initiated. A minimum of six hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or respiratory depression, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias and/or conduction blocks, and seizures is strongly advised. If signs of toxicity occur at any time during this period, extended monitoring is recommended. There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal dysrhythmias late after overdose; these patients had clinical evidence of significant poisoning prior to death and most received inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide management of the patient. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Gastrointestinal Decontamination</content>
                           <br/>  All patients suspected of overdose should receive gastrointestinal decontamination. This should include large volume gastric lavage followed by administration of activated charcoal. If consciousness is impaired, the airway should be secured prior to lavage. Emesis is contraindicated. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Cardiovascular</content>
                           <br/>  A maximal limb-lead QRS duration of ≥0.10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of an overdose. Serum alkalinization, using intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55 for patients with dysrhythmias and/or QRS widening. If the pH response is inadequate, hyperventilation may also be used. Concomitant use of hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate should be done with extreme caution, with frequent pH monitoring.  A pH &gt;7.60 or a pCO
 
  <sub>2</sub>&lt;20 mm Hg is undesirable. Dysrhythmias unresponsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine or phenytoin. Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide). 
  <br/>
                           <br/>  In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in patients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis generally have been reported as ineffective in treatment of tricyclic compound poisoning. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Central Nervous System</content>
                           <br/>  In patients with central nervous system depression, early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration. Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines, or, if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital or phenytoin). Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat life-threatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other therapies, and then only in consultation with a poison control center. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Psychiatric Follow-up</content>
                           <br/>  Since overdose often is deliberate, patients may attempt suicide by other means during the recovery phase. Psychiatric referral may be appropriate. 
  <br/>
                           <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Pediatric Management</content>
                           <br/>  The principles of management of child and adult overdoses are similar. It is strongly recommended that the physician contact the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.

                           <br/>  The median time to peak concentrations (T
 
  <sub>max</sub>) of doxepin occurred at 3.5 hours postdose after oral administration of a 6 mg dose to fasted healthy subjects. Peak plasma concentrations (C
 
  <sub>max</sub>) of doxepin increased in approximately a dose-proportional manner for 3 mg and 6 mg doses. The AUC was increased by 41% and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>by 15% when 6 mg doxepin was administered with a high fat meal. Additionally, compared to the fasted state, T
 
  <sub>max</sub>was delayed by approximately 3 hours. Therefore, for faster onset and to minimize the potential for next day effects, it is recommended that doxepin not be taken within 3 hours of a meal

                           <content styleCode="underline">Distribution</content>
                           <br/>  Doxepin is widely distributed throughout the body tissues. The mean apparent volume of distribution following a single 6 mg oral dose of doxepin to healthy subjects was 11,930 liters. Doxepin is approximately 80% bound to plasma proteins. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Metabolism</content>
                           <br/>  Following oral administration, doxepin is extensively metabolized by oxidation and demethylation.The primary metabolite is N-desmethyldoxepin (nordoxepin). 
  <br/>  The primary metabolite undergoes further biotransformation to glucuronide conjugates. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>studies have shown that CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are the major enzymes involved in doxepin metabolism, and that CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 are involved to a lesser extent. 
  <br/>  Doxepin appears not to have inhibitory effects on human CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations. The potential of doxepin to induce metabolizing enzymes is not known. Doxepin is not a Pgp substrate. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Excretion</content>
                           <br/>  Doxepin is excreted in the urine mainly in the form of glucuronide conjugates. 
  <br/>  Less than 3% of a doxepin dose is excreted in the urine as parent compound or nordoxepin. The apparent terminal half-life (t
 
  <sup>½)</sup>of doxepin was 15.3 hours and for nordoxepin was 31 hours.

                           <content styleCode="bold">Drug Interactions</content>
                           <br/>  Since doxepin is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, inhibitors of these CYP isozymes may increase the exposure of doxepin. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Cimetidine</content>
                           <br/>  The effect of cimetidine, a non-specific inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, on doxepin plasma concentrations was evaluated in healthy subjects. When cimetidine 300 mg BID was co-administered with a single dose of doxepin 6 mg, there was approximately a 2­ fold increase in doxepin C
 
  <sub>max</sub>and AUC compared to doxepin given alone. A maximum dose of doxepin in adults and elderly should be 3 mg, when doxepin is co-administered with cimetidine. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Sertraline</content>
                           <br/>  The effect of sertraline HCl, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on doxepin plasma concentrations was evaluated in a daytime study conducted with 24 healthy subjects. Following co-administration of doxepin 6 mg with sertraline 50 mg (at steady-state), the doxepin mean AUC and C
 
  <sub>max</sub>estimates were approximately 21% and 32% higher, respectively, than those obtained following administration of doxepin alone. Psychomotor function as measured by the digit symbol substitution test and symbol copy test performance was decreased more at 2-4 hours post dosing for the combination of sertraline and doxepin as compared to doxepin alone, but subjective measures of alertness were comparable for the two treatments.

                           <br/>  The effects of renal impairment on doxepin pharmacokinetics have not been studied. Because only small amounts of doxepin and nordoxepin are eliminated in the urine, renal impairment would not be expected to result in significantly altered doxepin concentrations. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Hepatic Impairment</content>
                           <br/>  The effects of doxepin in patients with hepatic impairment have not been studied. Because doxepin is extensively metabolized by hepatic enzymes, patients with hepatic impairment may display higher doxepin concentrations than healthy individuals. 
  <br/>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Poor Metabolizers of CYPs</content>
                           <br/>  Poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 may have higher doxepin plasma levels than normal subjects.

The plasma exposures (AUC) for doxepin and nordoxepin at the no-effect dose for adverse effects on reproductive performance and fertility in rats (10 mg/kg/day) are less than those in humans at the maximum recommended human dose of 6 mg/day.

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of doxepin for improving sleep maintenance was supported by six randomized, double-blind studies up to 3 months in duration that included 1,423 subjects, 18 to 93 years of age, with chronic (N=858) or transient (N=565) insomnia. Doxepin was evaluated at doses of 1 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg relative to placebo in inpatient (sleep laboratory) and outpatient settings. 
  <br/>  The primary efficacy measures for assessment of sleep maintenance were the objective and subjective time spent awake after sleep onset (respectively, objective Wake After Sleep Onset [WASO] and subjective WASO). 
  <br/>  Subjects in studies of chronic insomnia were required to have at least a 3-month history of insomnia.

                           <br/>  A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted in adults (N = 221) with chronic insomnia. Doxepin 3 mg and 6 mg was compared to placebo out to 30 days. 
  <br/>  Doxepin 3 mg and 6 mg were superior to placebo on objective WASO. Doxepin 3 mg was superior to placebo on subjective WASO at night 1 only. Doxepin 6 mg was superior to placebo on subjective WASO at night 1, and nominally superior at some later time points out to Day 30.

  <br/>  The first randomized, double-blind study assessed doxepin 1 mg and 3 mg relative to placebo for 3 months in inpatient and outpatient settings in elderly subjects (N=240) with chronic insomnia. Doxepin 3 mg was superior to placebo on objective WASO. 
  <br/>  The second randomized, double-blind study assessed doxepin 6 mg relative to placebo for 4 weeks in an outpatient setting in elderly subjects (N=254) with chronic insomnia. On subjective WASO, doxepin 6 mg was superior to placebo.

                           <content styleCode="underline">Transient Insomnia</content>
                           <br/>  Healthy adult subjects (N=565) experiencing transient insomnia during the first night in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, single-dose study of doxepin 6 mg relative to placebo. Doxepin 6 mg was superior to placebo on objective WASO and subjective WASO.

                           <br/>  Potential withdrawal effects were assessed in a 35-day double blind study of adults with chronic insomnia who were randomized to placebo, doxepin 3 mg, or doxepin 6 mg. There was no indication of a withdrawal syndrome after discontinuation of doxepin treatment (3 mg or 6 mg), as measured by the Tyrer’s Symptom Checklist. Discontinuation-period emergent nausea and vomiting occurred in 5% of subjects treated with 6 mg doxepin, versus 0% in 3 mg and placebo subjects.

                     <br/>
There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event. If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since “sleep-driving” can be dangerous. This behavior is more likely to occur when a hypnotic is taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants

  </content>Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a hypnotic. As with “sleep-driving”, patients usually do not remember these events.
  <br/>
In addition, patients should be advised to report all concomitant medications to the prescriber. Patients should be instructed to report events such as “sleep-driving” and other complex behaviors immediately to the prescriber.
