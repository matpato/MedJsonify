The      risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when      restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer.

If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles, check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology and pregnancy are excluded, bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product.</paragraph>

Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other drugs (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in the plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation.

The dosage of Turqoz is one white to off-white tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one orange inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to prescribed schedule. It is recommended that Turqoz tablets be taken by mouth at the same time each day.</paragraph>

If menstruation begins on a Sunday, the first tablet (white to off-white) is taken that day.

Withdrawal bleeding will usually occur within 3 days following discontinuation of white to off-white tablets and may not have finished before the next pack is started. During the first cycle, the patient should not rely on Turqoz for contraception until a white to off-white tablet has been taken daily for 7 consecutive days and she should use a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control during those 7 days.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>It is not known if hormonal birth control pills cause breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use birth control pills because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.</paragraph>
