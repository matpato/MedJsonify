                     <title>5.1 Hepatotoxicity</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Clinically significant and potentially life-threatening liver injury, including acute liver failure requiring transplant, has been reported in patients treated with teriflunomide tablets in the postmarketing setting. Patients with pre-existing liver disease and patients taking other hepatotoxic drugs may be at increased risk for developing liver injury when taking teriflunomide tablets. Clinically significant liver injury can occur at any time during treatment with teriflunomide tablets.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with pre-existing acute or chronic liver disease, or those with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) greater than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN) before initiatingÂ treatment, should not normally be treated with teriflunomide tablets. Teriflunomide tabletsÂ are contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (4)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In placebo-controlled trials in adult patients, ALT greater than three times the ULN occurred in 61/1,045 (5.8%) and 62/1,002 (6.2%) of patients receiving teriflunomide tablets 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, and 38/997 (3.8%) of patients receiving placebo, during the treatment period. These elevations occurred mostly within the first year of treatment. Half of the cases returned to normal without drug discontinuation. In clinical trials, if ALT elevation was greater than three times the ULN on two consecutive tests, teriflunomide tablet was discontinued and patients underwent an accelerated elimination procedure <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]</content>. Of the patients who underwent discontinuation and accelerated elimination in controlled trials, half returned to normal or near normal values within 2 months. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>One patient in the controlled trials in adult patients developed ALT 32 times the ULN and jaundice 5 months after initiation of teriflunomide tablets 14 mg treatment. The patient was hospitalized for 5 weeks and recovered after plasmapheresis and cholestyramine accelerated elimination procedure. Teriflunomide tablets-induced liver injury in this patient could not be ruled out. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Obtain serum transaminase and bilirubin levels within 6 months before initiation of teriflunomide tablets therapy. Monitor ALT levels at least monthly for six months after starting teriflunomide tablets. Consider additional monitoring when teriflunomide tablets are given with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Consider discontinuing teriflunomide tablets if serum transaminase increase (greater than three times the ULN) is confirmed. Monitor serum transaminase and bilirubin on teriflunomide tablets therapy, particularly in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine. If liver injury is suspected to be teriflunomide tablets-induced, discontinue teriflunomide tablets and start an accelerated elimination procedure <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] </content>and monitor liver tests weekly until normalized. If teriflunomide tablets-induced liver injury is unlikely because some other probable cause has been found, resumption of teriflunomide tablets therapy may be considered.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.3 Procedure for Accelerated Elimination of Teriflunomide</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Teriflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Â </content> Without an accelerated elimination procedure, it takes on average 8 months to reach plasma concentrations less than 0.02 mg/L, although because of individual variations in drug clearance it may take as long as 2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure could be used at any time after discontinuation of teriflunomide tablets. Elimination can be accelerated by either of the following procedures: <br/> â¢Â Â  Administration of cholestyramine 8 g every 8 hours for 11 days. If cholestyramine 8 g three times a day is not well tolerated, cholestyramine 4 g three times a day can be used.<br/> â¢Â Â  Administration of 50 g oral activated charcoal powder every 12 hours for 11 days. <br/> If either elimination procedure is poorly tolerated, treatment days do not need to be consecutive unless there is a need to lower teriflunomide plasma concentration rapidly. <br/> At the end of 11 days, both regimens successfully accelerated teriflunomide elimination, leading to more than 98% decrease in teriflunomide plasma concentrations. <br/> Use of the accelerated elimination procedure may potentially result in return of disease activity if the patient had been responding to teriflunomide tablets treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>A mean decrease compared to baseline in white blood cell (WBC) count of approximately 15% (mainly neutrophils and lymphocytes) and in platelet count of approximately 10% was observed in placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with 7 mg and 14 mg of teriflunomide tablets. The decrease in mean WBC count occurred during the first 6 weeks and WBC count remained low during treatment. In placebo-controlled studies in adult patients, neutrophil count &lt;1.5x10<sup>9</sup>/L was observed in 12% and 16% of patients receiving teriflunomide tablets 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared with 7% of patients receiving placebo; lymphocyte count &lt;0.8x10<sup>9</sup>/L was observed in 10% and 12% of patients receiving teriflunomide tablets 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively, compared with 6% of patients receiving placebo. No cases of serious pancytopenia were reported in premarketing clinical trials of teriflunomide tablets but rare cases of pancytopenia and agranulocytosis, have been reported in the postmarketing setting with leflunomide. A similar risk would be expected for teriflunomide tablets <content styleCode="italics">[see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]</content>. Cases of thrombocytopenia with teriflunomide tablets, including rare cases with platelet counts less than 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) within 6 months before the initiation of treatment with teriflunomide tablets.

                        <paragraph>Patients with active acute or chronic infections should not start treatment until the infection(s) is resolved. If a patient develops a serious infection consider suspending treatment with teriflunomide tablets and using an accelerated elimination procedure. Reassess the benefits and risks prior to resumption of therapy. Instruct patients receiving teriflunomide tablets to report symptoms of infections to a physician. </paragraph>
                        <br/>
                        <paragraph>Teriflunomide tablets are not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow disease, or severe, uncontrolled infections.

                           <br/> However, one fatal case of klebsiella pneumonia sepsis occurred in a patient taking teriflunomide tablets 14 mg for 1.7 years. Fatal infections have been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients receiving leflunomide, especially <content styleCode="italics">Pneumocystis jirovecii </content>pneumonia and aspergillosis. Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid disease, may predispose patients to infection. In clinical studies with teriflunomide tablets, cytomegalovirus hepatitis reactivation has been observed. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has occurred with teriflunomide tablets. One fatal case of DRESS that occurred in close temporal association (34 days) with the initiation of teriflunomide tablets treatment has been reported in the postmarketing setting. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately.</paragraph>

The incidence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed by nerve conduction studies was 1.4% (13 patients) and 1.9% (17 patients) of patients receiving 7 mg and 14 mg of teriflunomide tablets, respectively, compared with 0.4% receiving placebo (4 patients). Treatment was discontinued in 0.7% (8 patients) with confirmed peripheral neuropathy (3 patients receiving teriflunomide tablets 7 mg and 5 patients receiving teriflunomide tablets 14 mg). Five of them recovered following treatment discontinuation. Not all cases of peripheral neuropathy resolved with continued treatment.

                        <paragraph>In placebo-controlled studies, creatinine values increased more than 100% over baseline in 8/1,045 (0.8%) patients in the 7 mg teriflunomide tablets group and 6/1,002 (0.6%) patients in the 14 mg teriflunomide tablets group versus 4/997 (0.4%) patients in the placebo group. These elevations were transient. Some elevations were accompanied by hyperkalemia. Teriflunomide tablets may cause acute uric acid nephropathy with transient acute renal failure because teriflunomide tablets increases renal uric acid clearance. </paragraph>

Prospectively reported data (from clinical trials and postmarketing reports) from &gt;150 pregnancies in patients treated with teriflunomide and &gt; 300 pregnancies in patients treated with leflunomide have not demonstrated an increased rate of congenital malformations or miscarriage following teriflunomide exposure in the early first trimester when followed by an accelerated elimination procedure. Specific patterns of major congenital malformations in humans have not been observed. Limitations of these data include an inadequate number of reported pregnancies from which to draw conclusions, the short duration of drug exposure in reported pregnancies, which precludes a full evaluation of the fetal risks, incomplete reporting, and the inability to control for confounders (such as underlying maternal disease and use of concomitant medications).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>When teriflunomide (oral doses of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day) was administered to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis, high incidences of Â fetal malformation (primarily craniofacial, and axial and appendicular skeletal defects) and fetal death were observed at doses not associated with maternal toxicity. Adverse effects on fetal development were observed following dosing at various stages throughout organogenesis. Maternal plasma exposure at the no-effect level (1 mg/kg/day) for Â fetal developmental toxicity in rats was less than that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD, 14 mg/day). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Administration of teriflunomide (oral doses of 1, 3.5, or 12 mg/kg/day) to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in high incidences of fetal malformation (primarily craniofacial, and axial and appendicular skeletal defects) and fetal death at doses associated with minimal maternal toxicity. Maternal plasma exposure at the no-effect dose (1 mg/kg/day) for fetal developmental toxicity in rabbits was less than that in humans at the MRHD. </paragraph>

In published reproduction studies in pregnant mice, leflunomide was embryolethal and increased the incidence of malformations (craniofacial, axial skeletal, heart and great vessel). Supplementation with exogenous uridine reduced the teratogenic effects in pregnant mice, suggesting that the mode of action (inhibition of mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) is the same for therapeutic efficacy and developmental toxicity. <br/>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Four randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials established the efficacy of teriflunomide tablets in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated once daily doses of teriflunomide tablets 7 mg and teriflunomide tablets 14 mg for up to 26 months in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Patients were required to have a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis exhibiting a relapsing clinical course, with or without progression, and to have experienced at least one relapse over the year preceding the trial or at least two relapses over the two years preceding the trial. Patients were required not to have received interferon-beta for at least four months, or any other multiple sclerosis medication for at least six months before entering the study, nor were these medications permitted during the study. Neurological evaluations were to be performed at screening, every 12 weeks until week 108, and after suspected relapses. MRI was to be performed at screening, and at week 24, 48, 72, and 108. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate (ARR).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In Study 1, 1,088 patients were randomized to receive teriflunomide tablets 7 mg (n=366), teriflunomide tablets 14 mg (n=359), or placebo (n=363). At entry, patients had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score â¤5.5. Patients had a mean age of 38 years, mean disease duration of 5 years, and mean EDSS at baseline of 2.7. A total of 91% of patients had relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, and 9% had a progressive form of multiple sclerosis with relapses. The mean duration of treatment was 635, 627, and 631 days for teriflunomide tablets 7 mg, teriflunomide tablets 14 mg, and placebo, respectively. The percentage of patients who completed the study treatment period was 75%, 73%, and 71% for teriflunomide tablets 7 mg, teriflunomide tablets 14 mg, and placebo, respectively. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There was a statistically significant reduction in ARR for patients who received teriflunomide tablets 7 mg or teriflunomide tablets 14 mg, compared to patients who received placebo (see Table 2). There was a consistent reduction of the ARR noted in subgroups defined by sex, age group, prior multiple sclerosis therapy, and baseline disease activity. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There was a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk of disability progression at week 108 sustained for 12 weeks (as measured by at least a 1-point increase from baseline EDSS â¤ 5.5 or a 0.5 point increase for those with a baseline EDSS &gt; 5.5) in the teriflunomide tablets 14 mg group compared to placebo (see Table 2 and Figure 1). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The effect of teriflunomide tablets on several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) variables, including the total lesion volume of T2 and hypointense T1 lesions, was assessed in Study 1. The change in total lesion volume from baseline was significantly lower in the teriflunomide tablets 7 mg and teriflunomide tablets 14 mg groups than in the placebo group. Patients in both teriflunomide tablets groups had significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing lesions per T1-weighted scan than those in the placebo group (see Table 2).</paragraph>

Patients were required to have a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis exhibiting a relapsing clinical course and to have experienced at least one relapse over the year preceding the trial, or at least two relapses over the two years preceding the trial. Patients were required not to have received any multiple sclerosis medication for at least three months before entering the trial, nor were these medications permitted during the trial. Neurological evaluations were to be performed at screening, every 12 weeks until completion, and after every suspected relapse. The primary end point was the ARR. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A total of 1,165 patients received teriflunomide tablets 7 mg (n=407), teriflunomide tablets 14 mg (n=370), or placebo (n=388). Patients had a mean age of 38 years, a mean disease duration of 5 years, and a mean EDSS at baseline of 2.7. A total of 98% of patients had relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, and 2% had a progressive form of multiple sclerosis with relapses. The mean duration of treatment was 552, 567, and 571 days for teriflunomide tablets 7 mg, teriflunomide tablets 14 mg, and placebo, respectively. The percentage of patients who completed the study treatment period was 67%, 66%, and 68% for teriflunomide tablets 7 mg, teriflunomide tablets 14 mg, and placebo, respectively.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There was a statistically significant reduction in the ARR for patients who received teriflunomide tablets 7 mg or teriflunomide tablets 14 mg compared to patients who received placebo (see Table 3). There was a consistent reduction of the ARR noted in subgroups defined by sex, age group, prior multiple sclerosis therapy, and baseline disease activity. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>There was a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk of disability progression at week 108 sustained for 12 weeks (as measured by at least a 1-point increase from baseline EDSS â¤ 5.5 or a 0.5 point increase for those with a baseline EDSS &gt; 5.5) in the teriflunomide tablets 14 mg group compared to placebo (see Table 3 and Figure 2). </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Study 3 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that evaluated once daily doses of teriflunomide tablets 7 mg and teriflunomide tablets 14 mg for up to 108 weeks in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Patients were required to have had a first clinical event consistent with acute demyelination occurring within 90 days of randomization with 2 or more T2 lesions at least 3 mm in diameter that were characteristic of multiple sclerosis. A total of 614 patients received teriflunomide tablets 7 mg (n=203), teriflunomide tablets 14 mg (n=214), or placebo (n=197). Patients had a mean age of 32 years, EDSS at baseline of 1.7, and mean disease duration of two months. The proportion of patients free of relapse was greater in the teriflunomide tablets 7 mg (70.5%, p&lt;0.05) and teriflunomide tablets 14 mg (72.2%, p&lt;0.05) groups than in the placebo group (61.7%).Â </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The effect of teriflunomide tablets on MRI activity was also demonstrated in Study 4, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of multiple sclerosis patients with relapse. In Study 4, MRI was to be performed at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 18 weeks, 24 weeks, 30 weeks, and 36 weeks after treatment initiation. A total of 179 patients were randomized to teriflunomide tablets 7 mg (n=61), teriflunomide tablets 14 mg (n=57), or placebo (n=61). Baseline demographics were consistent across treatment groups. The primary endpoint was the average number of unique active lesions/MRI scan during treatment. The mean number of unique active lesions per brain MRI scan during the 36-week treatment period was lower in patients treated with teriflunomide tablets 7 mg (1.06) and teriflunomide tablets 14 mg (0.98) as compared to placebo (2.69), the difference being statistically significant for both (p=0.0234 and p=0.0052, respectively).</paragraph>
