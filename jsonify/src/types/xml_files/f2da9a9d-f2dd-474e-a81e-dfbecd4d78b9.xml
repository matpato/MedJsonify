                        <paragraph>For adults and pediatric patients, subsequent dosages may be increased in case of an inadequate response in 25 to 50 mg per day increments once a week, depending on tolerability, up to a maximum of 200 mg per day. Given the 24-hour elimination half-life of sertraline hydrochloride, the recommended interval between dose changes is one week.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1,000 patients treated are provided in Table 2.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing sertraline hydrochloride, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including sertraline hydrochloride, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [<content styleCode="italics">See Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID650">4</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID696">7.1</linkHtml>)</content>]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate sertraline hydrochloride in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking sertraline hydrochloride, discontinue sertraline hydrochloride before initiating treatment with the MAOI [<content styleCode="italics">See Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#ID650">4</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID696">7.1</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor all patients taking sertraline hydrochloride for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with sertraline hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [<content styleCode="italics">see Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#ID706">8.1</linkHtml>)</content>]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.</paragraph>

Signs and symptoms associated with more severe or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

                        <paragraph>False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking sertraline hydrochloride. This finding is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of sertraline hydrochloride.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled three-period crossover thorough QTc study in 54 healthy adult subjects, there was a positive relationship between the length of the rate-adjusted QTc interval and serum sertraline hydrochloride concentration.

In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of sertraline hydrochloride and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder.

                           <br/>In all placebo-controlled studies in patients with MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD and PMDD, 368 (12%) of the 3,066 patients who received sertraline hydrochloride discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 93 (4%) of the 2,293 placebo-treated patients. In placebo-controlled studies, the following were the common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in sertraline hydrochloride -treated patients:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>• MDD, OCD, PD, PTSD, SAD and PMDD: nausea (3%), diarrhea (2%), agitation (2%), and insomnia (2%).<br/>• MDD (&gt;2% and twice placebo): decreased appetite, dizziness, fatigue, headache, somnolence, tremor, and vomiting.<br/>• OCD: somnolence.<br/>• PD: nervousness and somnolence.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction</content>
                           <br/>Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 4 below displays the incidence of sexual adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of sertraline hydrochloride -treated patients and twice placebo from pooled placebo-controlled trials. For men and all indications, the most common adverse reactions (&gt;2% and twice placebo) included: ejaculation failure, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and male sexual dysfunction. For women, the most common adverse reaction (≥2% and twice placebo) was decreased libido.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers should encourage patients to enroll by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [<content styleCode="italics">see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID662">5.3</linkHtml>) and Clinical Considerations</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Overall, available published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to sertraline in the first trimester suggest no difference in major birth defect risk compared to the background rate for major birth defects in comparator populations. Some studies have reported increases for specific major birth defects; however, these study results are inconclusive <content styleCode="italics">[See Data]. </content>There are clinical considerations regarding neonates exposed to SSRIs and SNRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, during the third trimester of pregnancy <content styleCode="italics">[See Clinical Considerations].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although no teratogenicity was observed in animal reproduction studies, delayed fetal ossification was observed when sertraline was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in rats and doses 3.1 times the MRHD in rabbits on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis in adolescents. When sertraline was administered to female rats during the last third of gestation, there was an increase in the number of stillborn pups and pup deaths during the first four days after birth at the MRHD <content styleCode="italics">[See Data].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Advise a pregnant woman of possible risks to the fetus when prescribing sertraline hydrochloride tablets.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Neonates exposed to sertraline hydrochloride and other SSRIs or SNRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. These findings are based on post-marketing reports. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. In some cases, the clinical picture was consistent with serotonin syndrome <content styleCode="italics">[See Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID660">5.2</linkHtml>)].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Exposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20<sup>th</sup> week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. A study of 831,324 infants born in Sweden in 1997 to 2005 found a PPHN risk ratio of 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.3) associated with patient-reported maternal use of SSRIs "in early pregnancy" and a PPHN risk ratio of 3.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 8.3) associated with a combination of patient-reported maternal use of SSRIs "in early pregnancy" and an antenatal SSRI prescription "in later pregnancy".</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The weight of evidence from epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to sertraline in the first trimester suggest no difference in major birth defect risk compared to the background rate for major birth defects in pregnant women who were not exposed to sertraline. A meta-analysis of studies suggest no increase in the risk of total malformations (summary odds ratio=1.01, 95% CI=0.88 to 1.17) or cardiac malformations (summary odds ratio=0.93, 95% CI=0.70 to 1.23) among offspring of women with first trimester exposure to sertraline. An increased risk of congenital cardiac defects, specifically septal defects, the most common type of congenital heart defect, was observed in some published epidemiologic studies with first trimester sertraline exposure; however, most of these studies were limited by the use of comparison populations that did not allow for the control of confounders such as the underlying depression and associated conditions and behaviors, which may be factors associated with increased risk of these malformations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 3.1 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis in adolescents. There was no evidence of teratogenicity at any dose level. When pregnant rats and rabbits were given sertraline during the period of organogenesis, delayed ossification was observed in fetuses at doses of 10 mg/kg (0.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) in rats and 40 mg/kg (3.1 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) in rabbits. When female rats received sertraline during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation, there was an increase in stillborn pups and pup deaths during the first 4 days after birth. Pup body weights were also decreased during the first four days after birth. These effects occurred at a dose of 20 mg/kg (0.8 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 10 mg/kg (0.4 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). The decrease in pup survival was shown to be due to <content styleCode="italics">in utero</content> exposure to sertraline. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>The following have been reported with sertraline tablet overdosage:<br/>• Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.<br/>• Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co-ingestants including alcohol.<br/>• Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).<br/>Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a sertraline overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1-800-221-2222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Studies at clinically relevant doses have demonstrated that sertraline blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that sertraline is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. In vitro studies have shown that sertraline has no significant affinity for adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta), cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2), or benzodiazepine receptors. The chronic administration of sertraline was found in animals to down regulate brain norepinephrine receptors. Sertraline does not inhibit monoamine oxidase.</paragraph>

At 2-fold the maximum recommended daily dose (~3-fold the steady-state exposure for sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline), the largest mean ΔΔQTc was 10 ms with upper bound of two-sided 90% confidence interval of 12 ms. The length of the QTc interval was also positively correlated with serum concentrations of sertraline and N- desmethylsertraline concentrations. These concentration-based analyses, however, indicated a lesser effect on QTc at maximally observed concentration than in the primary analysis [<content styleCode="italics">See Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#ID655">5</linkHtml>), Adverse Reactions (<linkHtml href="#ID679">6</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID695">7</linkHtml>), Overdosage (<linkHtml href="#ID725">10</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following oral once-daily sertraline dosing over the range of 50 to 200 mg for 14 days, mean peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) of sertraline occurred between 4.5 to 8.4 hours post-dosing. The average terminal elimination half-life of plasma sertraline is about 26 hours. Consistent with the terminal elimination half-life, there is an approximately two-fold accumulation up to steady-state concentrations, which are achieved after one week of once-daily dosing. Linear dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were demonstrated in a single dose study in which the C<sub>max</sub> and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of sertraline were proportional to dose over a range of 50 to 200 mg. The single dose bioavailability of sertraline hydrochloride tablets is approximately equal to an equivalent dose of sertraline hydrochloride oral solution. Administration with food causes a small increase in C<sub>max </sub>and AUC.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to 104 hours. Both in vitro biochemical and in vivo pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline. Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabeled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in feces, including 12 to 14% unchanged sertraline. Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC (0 to 24-hour), C<sub>max</sub> and C<sub>min</sub>, with about a 5- to 9-fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14.</paragraph>

Relative to the adults, pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years and 13 to 17 years showed about 22% lower AUC (0 to 24 hr) and C<sub>max</sub> values when plasma concentration was adjusted for weight.

Steady-state, therefore, was achieved after 2 to 3 weeks in older patients.

The exposure to desmethylsertraline was approximately 2-fold greater in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared to age-matched volunteers with normal hepatic function. There were no significant differences in plasma protein binding observed between the two groups. The effects of sertraline hydrochloride in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [<content styleCode="italics">See Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#ID637">2.4</linkHtml>), Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#ID714">8.6</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Sertraline is extensively metabolized and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. In volunteers with mild to moderate (CLcr=30 to 60 mL/min), moderate to severe (CLcr=10 to 29 mL/min) or severe (receiving hemodialysis) renal impairment (N=10 each group), the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 200 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days were not altered compared to age-matched volunteers (N=12) with no renal impairment. Thus sertraline multiple dose pharmacokinetics appear to be unaffected by renal impairment [See Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#ID716">8.7</linkHtml>)].</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Many antidepressant drugs (e.g., SSRIs, including sertraline hydrochloride, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs) inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme CYP2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tricyclic antidepressant drugs and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of CYP2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the co-administered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of MDD in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline hydrochloride at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline hydrochloride has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition [See Drug Interactions (7.1)].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In three separate in vivo interaction studies, sertraline hydrochloride was co-administered with CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride under steady-state conditions. The results of these studies indicated that sertraline hydrochloride did not increase plasma concentrations of terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride. These data indicate that sertraline hydrochloride's extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Results of the interaction study with cisapride indicate that sertraline hydrochloride 200 mg (once daily) induces the metabolism of cisapride (cisapride AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were reduced by about 35%) [<content styleCode="italics">See Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#ID699">7.2</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

This small change in antipyrine half-life reflects a clinically insignificant change in hepatic metabolism.</paragraph>

These doses correspond to 1 times (mice) and 2 times (rats) the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. There was a dose-related increase of liver adenomas in male mice receiving sertraline at 10 to 40 mg/kg (0.25 to 1.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). No increase was seen in female mice or in rats of either sex receiving the same treatments, nor was there an increase in hepatocellular carcinomas. Liver adenomas have a variable rate of spontaneous occurrence in the CD-1 mouse and are of unknown significance to humans. There was an increase in follicular adenomas of the thyroid in female rats receiving sertraline at 40 mg/kg (2 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis); this was not accompanied by thyroid hyperplasia. While there was an increase in uterine adenocarcinomas in rats receiving sertraline at 10 to 40 mg/kg (0.5 to 2.0 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) compared to placebo controls, this effect was not clearly drug related.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph ID="ID759">The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PTSD was established in two multicenter placebo-controlled studies (Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD. The mean duration of PTSD for these patients was 12 years (Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2 combined) and 44% of patients (169 of the 385 patients treated) had secondary depressive disorder.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2 were 12-week flexible dose studies. Sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, and titrated in weekly increments of 50 mg per day to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day on the basis of clinical response and tolerability. The mean sertraline hydrochloride dose for completers was 146 mg/day and 151 mg/day, respectively, for Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2. Study outcome was assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS), which is a multi-item instrument that measures the three PTSD diagnostic symptom clusters of reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal as well as the patient-rated Impact of Event Scale (IES), which measures intrusion and avoidance symptoms. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride (N=99 and N=94, respectively) showed statistically significant improvement compared to placebo (N=83 and N=92) on change from baseline to endpoint on the CAPS, IES, and on the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI-S) Severity of Illness and Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In two additional placebo-controlled PTSD trials (Studies PSTD-3 and PSTD-4), the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant. One of these additional studies was conducted in patients similar to those recruited for Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2, while the second additional study was conducted in predominantly male veterans.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>As PTSD is a more common disorder in women than men, the majority (76%) of patients in Studies PSTD-1 and PSTD-2 described above were women. Post hoc exploratory analyses revealed a statistically significant difference between sertraline hydrochloride and placebo on the CAPS, IES and CGI in women, regardless of baseline diagnosis of comorbid major depressive disorder, but essentially no effect in the relatively smaller number of men in these studies. The clinical significance of this apparent gender effect is unknown at this time. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study PSTD-5, patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for PTSD who had responded during a 24-week open trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day (n=96) were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the open phase was defined as a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved), and a decrease in the CAPS-2 score of &gt; 30% compared to baseline. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met on two consecutive visits:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(1) CGI-I ≥3;</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(2) CAPS-2 score increased by ≥30% and by ≥15 points relative to baseline; and</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>(3) worsening of the patient's condition in the investigator's judgment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients receiving continued sertraline hydrochloride treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. This pattern was demonstrated in male and female subjects.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Study SAD-1 was a 12-week, flexible dose study comparing sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day), n=211, to placebo, n=204, in which sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, then titrated to the maximum tolerated dose in 50 mg increments biweekly.

                        <paragraph ID="ID810">Sertraline hydrochloride was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the LSAS and the percentage of responders.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Study SAD-2 was a 20-week, flexible dose study that compared sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day), n=135, to placebo, n=69. Sertraline hydrochloride was titrated to the maximum tolerated dose in 50 mg increments every 3 weeks. Study outcome was assessed by the:<br/>(1) Duke Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS), a multi-item clinician-rated instrument that measures fear, avoidance and physiologic response to social or performance situations,<br/>(2) Marks Fear Questionnaire Social Phobia Subscale (FQ-SPS), a 5-item patient-rated instrument that measures change in the severity of phobic avoidance and distress, and<br/>(3) CGI-I responder criterion of <content styleCode="underline">&lt;</content>2.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph ID="ID812">Sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the BSPS total score and fear, avoidance and physiologic factor scores, as well as the FQ-SPS total score, and to have statistically significantly more responders than placebo as defined by the CGI-I. Subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in treatment outcome on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Study SAD-3, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD who had responded while assigned to sertraline hydrochloride (CGI-I of 1 or 2) during a 20-week placebo-controlled trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse was defined as ≥2 point increase in the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score compared to baseline or study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride continuation treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate during this 24-week period than patients randomized to placebo substitution.</paragraph>

The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride for PMDD for more than 3 menstrual cycles has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients in Study PMDD-1 met DSM-III-R criteria for Late Luteal Phase Dysphoric Disorder (LLPDD), the clinical entity referred to as PMDD in DSM-IV. Patients in Study PMDD-2 met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Study PMDD-1 utilized continuous daily dosing throughout the study, while Study PMDD-2 utilized luteal phase dosing (intermittent dosing) for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses. The mean duration of PMDD symptoms was approximately 10.5 years in both studies. Patients taking oral contraceptives were excluded from these trials; therefore, the efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in combination with oral contraceptives for the treatment of PMDD is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Efficacy was assessed with the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria for PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms.
