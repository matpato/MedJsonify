                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The recommended starting dose of Testosterone Topical Solution is 60 mg of testosterone (2 pump actuations) applied once daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To ensure proper dosing, serum testosterone concentrations should be measured after initiation of therapy to ensure that the desired concentrations (300 ng/dL to 1050 ng/dL) are achieved. The Testosterone Topical Solution dose can be adjusted based on the serum testosterone concentration from a single blood draw 2 to 8 hours after applying Testosterone Topical Solution and at least 14 days after starting treatment or following dose adjustment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If the measured serum testosterone concentration is below 300 ng/dL, the daily testosterone dose may be increased from 60 mg (2 pump actuations) to 90 mg (3 pump actuations) or from 90 mg to 120 mg (4 pump actuations). If the serum testosterone concentration exceeds 1050 ng/dL, the daily testosterone dose should be decreased from 60 mg (2 pump actuations) to 30 mg (1 pump actuation) as instructed by a physician. If the serum testosterone concentration consistently exceeds 1050 ng/dL at the lowest daily dose of 30 mg (1 pump actuation), Testosterone Topical Solution therapy should be discontinued.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The application site and dose of Testosterone Topical Solution are not interchangeable with other topical testosterone products.</paragraph>

                     <title>2.2 Administration Instructions</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Testosterone Topical Solution is applied to the axilla, preferably at the same time each morning, to clean, dry, intact skin. Do not apply testosterone topical solution to other parts of the body including to the scrotum, penis, abdomen, shoulders or upper arms. After applying the solution, the application site should be allowed to dry completely prior to dressing. Avoid fire, flames or smoking until the solution has dried since alcohol based products, including testosterone topical solution, are flammable.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When deodorants or antiperspirants are used as part of a regular program for personal hygiene, they should not interfere with the efficacy of testosterone topical solution in treating hypogonadism. If patients use an antiperspirant or deodorant (stick or roll-on) then it should be applied at least 2 minutes prior to the application of Testosterone Topical Solution to avoid contamination of the stick or roll-on product.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients should be advised to avoid swimming or washing the application site until two hours following application of testosterone topical solution [<content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>To reduce the likelihood of interpersonal transfer of testosterone, the application site should always be washed prior to any skin-to-skin contact regardless of the length of time since application. [<content styleCode="italics">See Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Testosterone topical solution is applied to the axilla using an applicator. When using testosterone topical solution for the first time, patients should be instructed to prime the pump by depressing the pump three times, discard any product dispensed directly into a basin, sink, or toilet and then wash the liquid away thoroughly. This priming should be done only prior to the first use of each pump. After priming, patients should completely depress the pump one time (1 pump actuation) to dispense 30 mg of testosterone. Ensure that the liquid is directed into the cup. The cup should be filled with no more than 30 mg (1 pump actuation) of testosterone. Dosing that requires greater than one pump actuation must be applied in increments of 30 mg as is shown in Table 1.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Keeping the applicator upright, patients should place it up into the axilla and wipe steadily down and up into the axilla. If the solution drips or runs, it can be wiped back up with the applicator cup. The solution should not be rubbed into the skin with fingers or hand. The process is then repeated with application of 30 mg of testosterone (1 pump actuation) to the other axilla to achieve a total of 60 mg of testosterone applied. For patients prescribed the 90 mg dose of testosterone, the procedure is the same, but three applications are required. To dose 120 mg of testosterone, four applications are required alternating left and right for each application as shown in Table 1. When repeat application to the same axilla is required, the axilla should be allowed to dry completely before more testosterone topical solution is applied. After use, the applicator should be rinsed under room temperature, running water and then patted dry with a tissue. The applicator and cap are then replaced on the bottle for storage.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone in children and women have been reported with topical testosterone products applied to the abdomen or upper arms, including cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using Testosterone Topical Solution [<content styleCode="italics">see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone therapy should be promptly discontinued at least until the cause of virilization has been identified.

                        <paragraph>Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating testosterone treatment. It would be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting testosterone treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable level. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use Testosterone Topical Solution.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions [<content styleCode="italics">see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range. However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pregnancy Category X [<content styleCode="italics">see Contraindications (4)</content>] — Testosterone Topical Solution is contraindicated during pregnancy or in women who may become pregnant. Testosterone is teratogenic and may cause fetal harm. Exposure of a female fetus to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Drug abuse is intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological and physiological effects. Abuse and misuse of testosterone are seen in male and female adults and adolescents. Testosterone, often in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), and not obtained by prescription through a pharmacy, may be abused by athletes and bodybuilders. There have been reports of misuse by men taking higher doses of legally obtained testosterone than prescribed and continuing testosterone despite adverse events or against medical advice.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Serious adverse reactions have been reported in individuals who abuse anabolic androgenic steroids and include cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, hepatotoxicity, and serious psychiatric manifestations, including major depression, mania, paranoia, psychosis, delusions, hallucinations, hostility and aggression.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have also been reported in men: transient ischemic attacks, convulsions, hypomania, irritability, dyslipidemias, testicular atrophy, subfertility, and infertility.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in women: hirsutism, virilization, deepening of voice, clitoral enlargement, breast atrophy, male-pattern baldness, and menstrual irregularities.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The following adverse reactions have been reported in male and female adolescents: premature closure of bony epiphyses with termination of growth, and precocious puberty.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and may include abuse of other agents, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter's syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH).</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="underline">Excretion</content> — There is considerable variation in the half-life of testosterone as reported in the literature, ranging from 10 to 100 minutes. About 90% of a dose of testosterone given intramuscularly is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; about 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver.</paragraph>

At 2 hours after the application of testosterone topical solution to the males, the females rubbed their outer forearms for 15 minutes on the axilla of the males.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The males had covered the application area with a T-shirt. Serum concentrations of testosterone were monitored in the female subjects for 72 hours after the transfer procedure. Study results show a 13% and 17% increase in testosterone exposure (AUC<sub>[0-24]</sub>) and maximum testosterone concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), respectively, compared to baseline in these females. In a prior clinical study conducted with a 1% testosterone formulation under similar study conditions, direct skin-to-skin transfer showed a 131% and 297% increase in testosterone exposure (AUC<sub>[0-72]</sub>) and maximum testosterone concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), respectively, compared to when men had covered the application area with a T-shirt.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a clinical study conducted with a 2% testosterone formulation to evaluate the effect of washing on the residual amount of testosterone at the axilla, 10 healthy male subjects received 60 mg (2 pump actuations) of testosterone to each axilla (the maximum testosterone dose of 120 mg). Following 5 minutes of drying time, the left axilla was wiped with alcohol towelettes which were assayed for testosterone content. Subjects were required to shower with soap and water 30 minutes after application. The right axilla was then wiped with alcohol towelettes which were assayed for testosterone content. A mean (SD) of 3.1 (2.8) mg of residual testosterone (i.e., 92.6% reduction compared to when axilla was not washed) was recovered after washing this area with soap and water.

A control group of 6 subjects only applied 30 mg (1 pump actuation) of testosterone to a single axilla. Blood samples were collected for 72 hours from all subjects following testosterone topical solution administration. Although a decrease of up to 33% of testosterone exposure (AUC<sub>[0-72]</sub>) was observed when antiperspirants or deodorants are used 2 minutes prior to testosterone topical solution application, underarm deodorant or antiperspirant spray or stick products may be used 2 minutes prior to Testosterone Topical Solution application as part of normal, consistent, and daily routine.

A control group of 6 female subjects applied 30 mg (1 pump actuation) of testosterone to a single axilla and did not wash the application site. Blood samples were collected for 72 hours from all subjects following dosing with testosterone topical solution. A decrease of up to 35% of testosterone exposure (AUC<sub>[0-72</sub>]) was observed when applications sites were washed 2 hours and 6 hours after testosterone topical solution application.

                        <paragraph>Testosterone has been tested by subcutaneous injection and implantation in mice and rats. In mice, the implant induced cervical-uterine tumors, which metastasized in some cases. There is suggestive evidence that injection of testosterone into some strains of female mice increases their susceptibility to hepatoma. Testosterone is also known to increase the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically induced carcinomas of the liver in rats. Testosterone was negative in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>Ames and in the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>mouse micronucleus assays. The administration of exogenous testosterone has been reported to suppress spermatogenesis in the rat, dog and non-human primates, which was reversible on cessation of the treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Testosterone topical solution was evaluated in a multicenter, open label, 120-day trial that enrolled 155 hypogonadal men at 26 clinical research centers. The median age of subjects was 53 years with a range of 19 to 78 years. Of the 144 subjects whose race was recorded, 122 (84.7%) were Caucasian, 13 (9.0%) were Hispanic, 6 (4.2%) were African Americans, 1 (0.7%) was Asian and 2 (1.4%) had race recorded as “Other”.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients were instructed to apply testosterone topical solution to unclothed, clean, dry, and unbroken skin. The solution was applied to the axillary area. Patients were not instructed to alter their normal grooming routine, e.g., shave under the arm.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>During the initial testosterone topical solution treatment period (Days 1 to 15) 143 patients were treated with 60 mg of testosterone daily. On Day 45 of the trial, patients were maintained at the same dose, or were titrated up or down, based on their 24 hour average serum testosterone concentration measured on Day 15. On Day 90 of the trial, patients were maintained at the same dose, or were titrated up or down, based on their 24 hour average serum testosterone concentration measured on Day 60.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>On day 120, 75% of responding patients finished the study on the starting dose of 60 mg of testosterone, while 2% had been titrated to 30 mg, 17% had been titrated to 90 mg and 6% had been titrated to the 120 mg dose.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>On day 60, 84.8% of subjects had total testosterone concentrations in the normal range. Of those who had sufficient data for analysis on day 120, 84.1%, had their average serum testosterone concentration in the normal range of 300 to 1050 ng/dL. </paragraph>
