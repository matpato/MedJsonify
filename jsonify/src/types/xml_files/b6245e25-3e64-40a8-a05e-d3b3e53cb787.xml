in Treating
Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I
Disorder</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders, however, diagnosis can be challenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no systematically collected data to specifically address switching patients from other antipsychotics to quetiapine extended-release tablets, or concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic treatment may be acceptable for some patients, more gradual discontinuation may be most appropriate for others. In all cases, the period of overlapping antipsychotic administration should be minimized. When switching patients from depot antipsychotics, if medically appropriate, initiate quetiapine extended-release tablets therapy in place of the next scheduled injection. The need for continuing existing extrapyramidal syndrome medication should be re-evaluated periodically.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly
Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10-weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine extended-release is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_bb7ceb11-60f8-401d-96f1-e2c3a6687b98">Boxed Warning</linkHtml>].</content>

Adults</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose, and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these metabolic profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.</paragraph>

In a placebo-controlled quetiapine extended-release monotherapy study (8-weeks duration) of children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the mean change in fasting glucose levels for quetiapine extended-release (n = 60) compared to placebo (n = 62) was 1.8 mg/dL versus 1.6 mg/dL. In this study, there were no patients in the quetiapine extended-release or placebo-treated groups with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (&lt; 100 mg/dL) that had an increase in blood glucose level â¥ 126 mg/dL. There was one patient in the quetiapine extended-release group with a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (â¥ 100 mg/dL and &lt; 126 mg/dL) who had an increase in blood glucose level of &gt; 126 mg/dL compared to zero patients in the placebo group.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.6 Tardive Dyskinesia</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Given these considerations, quetiapine extended-release should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on quetiapine extended-release, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with quetiapine despite the presence of the syndrome.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Quetiapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its Î±<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 0.3% (5/1866) of the patients treated with quetiapine extended-release across all indications, compared with 0.2% (2/928) on placebo. Syncope was reported in 1% (28/3,265) of the patients treated with SEROQUEL, compared with 0.2% (2/954) on placebo. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope may lead to falls.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quetiapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine extended-release, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor, and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries.

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Agranulocytosis has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal cases and cases in patients without pre-existing risk factors. Neutropenia should be considered in patients presenting with infection, particularly in the absence of obvious predisposing factor(s), or in patients with unexplained fever, and should be managed as clinically appropriate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue quetiapine extended-release at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1,000/mm<sup>3</sup>) should discontinue quetiapine extended-release and have their WBC followed until recovery.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_d078a6ee-aad4-459a-87c1-1013a25dd14d">Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)</linkHtml>]. </content>Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children, and adolescents during long-term quetiapine treatment but a causal relationship to quetiapine use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_a0510ff1-98b8-4ba4-b02b-8a581a75b5f1">Overdosage (10.1)</linkHtml>]</content>, in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval<content styleCode="italics">.</content>

                        <paragraph>The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g., cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure and heart hypertrophy).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>During short-term clinical trials with quetiapine extended-release, seizures occurred in 0.05% (1/1,866) of patients treated with quetiapine extended-release across all indications compared to 0.3% (3/928) on placebo. During clinical trials with SEROQUEL, seizures occurred in 0.5% (20/3490) of patients treated with SEROQUELÂ compared to 0.2% (2/954) on placebo. As with other antipsychotics, quetiapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimerâs dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Adults: </content>Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T<sub>4</sub>, irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patientâs thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T<sub>4</sub>, in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at follow-up.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In quetiapine extended-release clinical trials across all indications 1.8% (24/1,336) of patients on quetiapine extended-release versus 0.6% (3/530) on placebo experienced decreased free thyroxine (&lt;0.8 LLN) and 1.6% (21/1,346) on quetiapine extended-release vs. 3.4% (18/534) on placebo experienced increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). About 0.7% (26/3,489) of SEROQUELÂ patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were<sup>1</sup>: decrease in free T<sub>4</sub> (&lt;0.8 LLN), 2.0% (357/17,513); decrease in total T<sub>4 </sub>(&lt;0.8 LLN), 4.0% (75/1,861); decrease in free T<sub>3 </sub>(&lt;0.8 LLN), 0.4% (53/13,766); decrease in total T<sub>3 </sub>(&lt;0.8 LLN), 2.0% (26/1,312), and increase in TSH (&gt;5 mIU/L), 4.9% (956/19,412). In eight patients, where TBG was measured, levels of TBG were unchanged.</paragraph>

Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3-day period of initial dose titration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 24.7% (235/951) of patients on quetiapine extended-release compared to 10.3% (33/319) of placebo patients. In a bipolar depression clinical trial, somnolence was reported in 51.8% (71/137) of patients on quetiapine extended-release compared to 12.9% (18/140) of placebo patients. In a clinical trial for bipolar mania, somnolence was reported in 50.3% (76/151) of patients on quetiapine extended-release compared to 11.9% (19/160) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In short-term adjunctive therapy trials for MDD, somnolence was reported in 40% (252/627) of patients on quetiapine extended-release respectively compared to 9% (27/309) of placebo patients. Somnolence was dose-related in these trials (37% (117/315) and 43% (135/312) for the 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine extended-release that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1,993) for quetiapine extended-release and 6.7% (71/1,065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness and irritability) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1-week post-discontinuation.

                        <paragraph>Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when quetiapine extended-release is used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. Quetiapine extended-release should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects <content styleCode="italics">[see <content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine extended-release consisting of approximately 3,400 patients exposed to quetiapine extended-release for the treatment of Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder in placebo-controlled trials. This experience corresponds to approximately 1,020.1 patient-years. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, body weights, laboratory analyses and ECG results.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, an adverse reaction of the type listed.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">ass Effect</content>: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Four methods were used to measure EPS: (1) Simpson-Angus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Global Assessment Score, (3) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (4) use of anticholinergic medications to treat EPS.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="italics">Adults</content>: In placebo-controlled clinical trials with quetiapine, utilizing doses up to 800 mg per day, the incidence of any adverse reactions related to EPS ranged from 8% to 11% for quetiapine and 4% to 11% for placebo.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In three-arm placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia, utilizing doses between 300 mg and 800 mg of quetiapine extended-release, the incidence of any adverse reactions related to EPS was 8% for quetiapine extended-release and 8% for SEROQUELÂ (without evidence of being dose related), and 5% in the placebo group. In these studies, the incidence of the individual adverse reactions (akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, restlessness, and muscle rigidity) was generally low and did not exceed 3% for any treatment group.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At the end of treatment, the mean change from baseline in SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score was similar across the treatment groups. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and similar across the treatment groups. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was consistent with that seen with the profile of SEROQUELÂ in schizophrenia patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In Tables 16 to 19, dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, muscle rigidity, oculogyration; parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity, tremor, drooling, hypokinesia; akathisia included akathisia, psychomotor agitation; dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, choreoathetosis; and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness, extrapyramidal disorder, movement disorder.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for SEROQUELÂ consisting of over 1,000 pediatric patients. This database includes 677 adolescents (13 to 17 years old) exposed to SEROQUELÂ for the treatment of schizophrenia and 393 children and adolescents (10 to 17 years old) exposed to SEROQUELÂ for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Schizophrenia: The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapine-treated and placebo-treated patients was 8.2% and 2.7%, respectively. The adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in 2% or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo was somnolence (2.7% and 0% for placebo).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Bipolar I Mania: The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapine-treated and placebo-treated patients was 11.4% and 4.4%, respectively. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in 2% or more of patients on SEROQUELÂ and at a greater incidence than placebo were somnolence (4.1% vs. 1.1%) and fatigue (2.1% vs. 0%).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In an acute (8-week) quetiapine extended-release trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine extended-release (incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice that for placebo) were: dizziness (7%), diarrhea (5%), fatigue (5%) and nausea (5%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In therapy for schizophrenia (up to 6-weeks), the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in adolescents (incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (34%), dizziness (12%), dry mouth (7%), tachycardia (7%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3-weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53%), dizziness (18%), fatigue (11%), increased appetite (9%), nausea (8%), vomiting (8%), tachycardia (7%), dry mouth (7%), and weight increased (6%).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Table 20 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 6-weeks) of schizophrenia in 2% or more of patients treated with SEROQUELÂ (doses of 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day) where the incidence in patients treated with SEROQUELÂ was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse reactions that were potentially dose-related with higher frequency in the 800 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included dizziness (8% vs. 15%), dry mouth (4% vs. 10%), and tachycardia (6% vs. 11%).</paragraph>

Quetiapine extended-release was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 6.3 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 0.4 beats per minute for placebo. This is consistent with the rates for SEROQUEL. The incidence of adverse reactions of tachycardia was 1.9% for quetiapine extended-release compared to 0.5% for placebo. SEROQUELÂ use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute among placebo patients. The slight tendency for tachycardia may be related to quetiapineâs potential for inducing orthostatic changes <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_7f2220ac-a2f2-448a-86c6-ba3b9b902197">Warnings and Precautions (5.7)</linkHtml>].</content>

Effect of Other Drugs
on Quetiapine</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The risks of using quetiapine extended-release in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine extended-release, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.) and decreased by the prototype of CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. Johnâs wort etc.). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>CYP3A4 inhibitors:</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Co-administration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure.

In animal studies, embryo-fetal toxicity occurred including delays in skeletal ossification at approximately 1 and 2 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 800 mg/day in both rats and rabbits, and an increased incidence of carpal/tarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the MRHD. In addition, fetal weights were decreased in both species. Maternal toxicity (observed as decreased body weights and/or death) occurred at 2 times the MRHD in rats and approximately 1 to 2 times the MRHD in rabbits. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. </paragraph>

However, there was evidence of embryo-fetal toxicity, including delays in skeletal ossification at approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day in both rats and rabbits and an increased incidence of carpal/tarsal flexure (minor soft tissue anomaly) in rabbit fetuses at approximately 2 times the MRHD. In addition, fetal weights were decreased in both species. Maternal toxicity (observed as decreased body weights and/or death) occurred at 2 times the MRHD in rats and at approximately 1 to 2 times the MRHD (all doses tested) in rabbits.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a peri/postnatal reproductive study in rats, no drug-related effects were observed when pregnant dams were treated with quetiapine at doses 0.01, 0.1, and 0.2 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. However, in a preliminary peri/postnatal study, there were increases in fetal and pup death, and decreases in mean litter weight at 3 times the MRHD.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release for the treatment of bipolar depression in patients under the age of 18 years has not been established. One 8-week trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of quetiapine extended-release in the treatment of bipolar depression in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate whether quetiapine extended-release at a dose of 150 mg/day to 300 mg/day demonstrated superior efficacy (as measured by change in CDRS-R total score from baseline to end of 8-weeks) compared to placebo in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with bipolar depression. A total of 193 patients with bipolar depression were randomized to placebo or quetiapine extended-release. The primary results of this study did not show a difference between quetiapine extended-release and placebo in decreasing depression symptoms in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. In this study, patients treated with quetiapine extended-release exhibited metabolic changes, weight gain, increases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_7c79e61f-1d6c-472d-8c04-f7b91d47de9c">Warnings and Precautions (5.5</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_e13baa7f-3813-4f6e-a3e2-2001581db4e6">5.9</linkHtml>) </content>and<content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>Sixty-eight patients in clinical studies with quetiapine extended-release were 65 years of age or over. In general, there was no indication of any different tolerability of quetiapine extended-release in the elderly compared to younger adults. Nevertheless, the presence of factors that might decrease pharmacokinetic clearance, increase the pharmacodynamic response to quetiapine extended-release, or cause poorer tolerance or orthostasis, should lead to consideration of a lower starting dose, slower titration, and careful monitoring during the initial dosing period in the elderly. The mean plasma clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 30% to 50% in elderly patients when compared to younger patients <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_036bb2c9-da55-4073-9ad5-4c70147c2ce9">Dosage and Administration (2.3) </linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>In clinical trials, survival has been reported in acute overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine. Most patients who overdosed experienced no adverse reactions or recovered fully from the reported events. Death has been reported in a clinical trial following an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine alone. In general, reported signs and symptoms were those resulting from an exaggeration of the drugâs known pharmacological effects, i.e., drowsiness, sedation, tachycardia, hypotension, and anticholinergic toxicity including coma and delirium. Patients with pre-existing severe cardiovascular disease may be at an increased risk of the effects of overdose <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_40d1612d-f54b-4e1a-b0bb-e41597bd3036">Warnings and Precautions (5.12)</linkHtml>]</content>. One case, involving an estimated overdose of 9600 mg, was associated with hypokalemia and first degree heart block. In post-marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation with overdose.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mechanism of action of quetiapine Â in the listed indications is unclear. However, the efficacy of quetiapine in these indications could be mediated through a combination of dopamine type 2 (D<sub>2</sub>) and serotonin type 2A (5HT<sub>2A</sub>) antagonism. The active metabolite, N-desalkyl quetiapine (norquetiapine), has similar activity at D<sub>2</sub>, but greater activity at 5HT<sub>2A</sub>Â receptors, than the parent drug (quetiapine). </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Quetiapine and its metabolite norquetiapine have affinity for multiple neurotransmitter receptors with norquetiapine binding with higher affinity than quetiapine in general. The K<sub>i</sub> values for quetiapine and norquetiapine at the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> are 428/99.8 nM, at D<sub>2</sub> 626/489nM, at serotonin 5HT<sub>1A</sub> 1040/191 nM at 5HT<sub>2A</sub> 38/2.9 nM, at histamine H<sub>1</sub> 4.4/1.1 nM, at muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> 1086/38.3 nM, and at adrenergic Î±<sub>1</sub>b 14.6/46.4 nM and, at Î±<sub>2</sub> receptors 617/1290 nM, respectively. Quetiapine and norquetiapine lack appreciable affinity to the benzodiazepine receptors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Effect on QT Interval</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine <content styleCode="italics">[</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Adults</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following multiple dosing of quetiapine up to a total daily dose of 800 mg, administered in divided doses, the plasma concentration of quetiapine and norquetiapine, the major active metabolite of quetiapine, were proportional to the total daily dose. Accumulation is predictable upon multiple dosing. Steady-state mean C<sub>max</sub>Â and AUC of norquetiapine are about 21% to 27% and 46% to 56%, respectively, of that observed for quetiapine. Elimination of quetiapine is mainly via hepatic metabolism. The mean-terminal half-life is approximately 7 hours for quetiapine and approximately 12 hours for norquetiapine within the clinical dose range. Steady-state concentrations are expected to be achieved within two days of dosing. Quetiapine extended-release is unlikely to interfere with the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Children and Adolescents</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At steady-state, the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), were similar to adults. However, when adjusted for dose and weight, AUC and C<sub>max </sub>of the parent compound were 41% and 39% lower, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. For the active metabolite, norquetiapine, AUC and C<sub>max</sub>Â were 45% and 31% higher, respectively, in children and adolescents than in adults. When adjusted for dose and weight, the pharmacokinetics of the metabolite, norquetiapine, was similar between children and adolescents and adults <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2a76746e-04aa-4ca6-8470-1aa0e68d79ac">Use in Specific Populations (8.4)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Absorption</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quetiapine reaches peak plasma concentrations approximately 6 hours following administration. Quetiapine extended-release dosed once daily at steady-state has comparable bioavailability to an equivalent total daily dose of SEROQUELÂ administered in divided doses, twice daily. A high-fat meal (approximately 800 to 1,000 calories) was found to produce statistically significant increases in the quetiapine extended-release C<sub>m</sub>
                           <sub>a</sub>
                           <sub>x</sub>Â and AUC of 44% to 52% and 20% to 22%, respectively, for the 50 mg and 300 mg tablets. In comparison, a light meal (approximately 300 calories) had no significant effect on the C<sub>max </sub>or AUC of quetiapine. It is recommended that quetiapine extended-release be taken without food or with a light meal <content styleCode="italics">[see</content>

                        <paragraph>Distribution</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quetiapine is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 10Â±4 L/kg. It is 83% bound to plasma proteins at therapeutic concentrations. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content>, quetiapine did not affect the binding of warfarin or diazepam to human serum albumin. In turn, neither warfarin nor diazepam altered the binding of quetiapine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Metabolism and Elimination</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following a single oral dose of <sup>14</sup>C-quetiapine, less than 1% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged drug, indicating that quetiapine is highly metabolized. Approximately 73% and 20% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, respectively. The average dose fraction of free quetiapine and its major active metabolite is &lt;5% excreted in the urine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver. The major metabolic pathways are sulfoxidation to the sulfoxide metabolite and oxidation to the parent acid metabolite; both metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro </content>studies using human liver microsomes revealed that the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme is involved in the metabolism of quetiapine to its major, but inactive, sulfoxide metabolite and in the metabolism of its active metabolite norquetiapine.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Age</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Oral clearance of quetiapine was reduced by 40% in elderly patients (â¥ 65 years, n = 9) compared to young patients (n =12), and dosing adjustment may be necessary <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_036bb2c9-da55-4073-9ad5-4c70147c2ce9">Dosage and Administration (2.3)</linkHtml>].</content>

                        <paragraph>Renal Insufficiency</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Patients with severe renal impairment (CL<sub>cr</sub>=10 to 30 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, n=8) had a 25% lower mean oral clearance than normal subjects (CL<sub>cr </sub>&gt; 80 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, n=8), but plasma quetiapine concentrations in the subjects with renal insufficiency were within the range of concentrations seen in normal subjects receiving the same dose. Dosage adjustment is therefore not needed in these patients <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_2d3fa5ac-2c53-4bcc-9896-8e50bc15345b">Use in Specific Populations (8.6)</linkHtml>]</content>. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Hepatically impaired patients (n=8) had a 30% lower mean oral clearance of quetiapine than normal subjects. In 2 of the 8 hepatically impaired patients, AUC and C<sub>max</sub>Â were 3 times higher than those observed typically in healthy subjects. Since quetiapine is extensively metabolized by the liver, higher plasma levels are expected in the hepatically impaired population, and dosage adjustment may be needed <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_d0ea12bb-63d2-4f13-9b21-9fd3038a0f9c">Dosage and Administration (2.4)</linkHtml>

                        <paragraph>Carcinogenesis</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in C57BL mice and Wistar rats. Quetiapine was administered in the diet to mice at doses of 20 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, and 750 mg/kg and to rats by gavage at doses of 25 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 250 mg/kg for two years. These doses are equivalent to 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (mice) or 0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area (rats). There were statistically significant increases in thyroid gland follicular adenomas in male mice at doses 1.5 and 4.5 times the MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area and in male rats at a dose of 3 times the MRHD on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. Mammary gland adenocarcinomas were statistically significantly increased in female rats at all doses tested (0.3, 1, and 3 times the MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Thyroid follicular cell adenomas may have resulted from chronic stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) resulting from enhanced metabolism and clearance of thyroxine by rodent liver. Changes in TSH, thyroxine, and thyroxine clearance consistent with this mechanism were observed in subchronic toxicity studies in rat and mouse and in a 1-year toxicity study in rat; however, the results of these studies were not definitive. The relevance of the increases in thyroid follicular cell adenomas to human risk, through whatever mechanism, is unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to chronically elevate prolactin levels in rodents. Serum measurements in a 1-year toxicity study showed that quetiapine increased median serum prolactin levels a maximum of 32- and 13-fold in male and female rats, respectively. Increases in mammary neoplasms have been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and are considered to be prolactin-mediated. The relevance of this increased incidence of prolactin-mediated mammary gland tumors in rats to human risk is unknown <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_157ea391-96e4-44b6-ae05-fa684a488a0d">Warnings and Precautions (5.15)</linkHtml>].</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Mutagenesis</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quetiapine was not mutagenic or clastogenic in standard genotoxicity tests. The mutagenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> Ames bacterial gene mutation assay and in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> mammalian gene mutation assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The clastogenic potential of quetiapine was tested in the <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes and in the <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats up to 500 mg/kg which is 6 times the MRHDÂ based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Impairment of Fertility</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Quetiapine decreased mating and fertility in male Sprague-Dawley rats at oral doses of 50 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg or approximately 1 and 3 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. Drug-related effects included increases in interval to mate and in the number of matings required for successful impregnation. These effects continued to be observed at 3 times the MRHD even after a two-week period without treatment. The no-effect dose for impaired mating and fertility in male rats was 25 mg/kg, or 0.3 times the MRHD based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. Quetiapine adversely affected mating and fertility in female Sprague-Dawley rats at an oral dose approximately 1 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. Drug-related effects included decreases in matings and in matings resulting in pregnancy, and an increase in the interval to mate. An increase in irregular estrus cycles was observed at doses of 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, or approximately 0.1 and 1 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. The no-effect dose in female rats was 1 mg/kg, or 0.01 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Quetiapine caused a dose-related increase in pigment deposition in thyroid gland in rat toxicity studies which were 4-weeks in duration or longer and in a mouse 2-year carcinogenicity study. Doses were 10,Â  25, 50, 75, 150 and 250 mg/kg in rat studies which are approximately 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1, 2 and 3-times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2 </sup>body surface area, respectively. Doses in the mouse carcinogenicity study were 20, 75, 250 and 750 mg/kg which are approximately 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. Pigment deposition was shown to be irreversible in rats. The identity of the pigment could not be determined, but was found to be co-localized with quetiapine in thyroid gland follicular epithelial cells. The functional effects and the relevance of this finding to human risk are unknown.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In dogs receiving quetiapine for 6 or 12 months, but not for 1-month, focal triangular cataracts occurred at the junction of posterior sutures in the outer cortex of the lens at a dose of 100 mg/kg, or 4 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area. This finding may be due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by quetiapine. Quetiapine caused a dose-related reduction in plasma cholesterol levels in repeat-dose dog and monkey studies; however, there was no correlation between plasma cholesterol and the presence of cataracts in individual dogs. The appearance of delta- 8-cholestanol in plasma is consistent with inhibition of a late stage in cholesterol biosynthesis in these species. There also was a 25% reduction in cholesterol content of the outer cortex of the lens observed in a special study in quetiapine treated female dogs. Drug-related cataracts have not been seen in any other species; however, in a 1-year study in monkeys, a striated appearance of the anterior lens surface was detected in 2/7 females at a dose of 225 mg/kg or 5.5 times the MRHD of 800 mg/day based on mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release in the treatment of schizophrenia was demonstrated in 1 short-term, 6-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled trial of inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia (n=573) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia. Quetiapine extended-release (once daily) was administered as 300 mg on Day 1, and the dose was increased to either 400 mg or 600 mg by Day 2, or 800 mg by Day 3. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at the end of treatment (Day 42). Quetiapine extended-release doses of 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg once daily were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score at Day 42 (Study 1 in Table 26).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release in the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age) was supported by a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were randomized into one of three treatment groups: SEROQUELÂ 400 mg/day (n = 73), SEROQUELÂ 800 mg/day (n = 74), or placebo (n = 75). Study medication was initiated at 50 mg/day and on day 2 increased to 100 mg/per day (divided and given two or three times per day). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to the target dose of 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day using increments of 100 mg/day, divided and given two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). SEROQUELÂ at 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day was superior to placebo in the reduction of PANSS total score (Study 2 in Table 26).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a longer-term trial (Study 3), clinically stable adult outpatients (n=171) meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia who remained stable following 16-weeks of open-label treatment with flexible doses of quetiapine extended-release (400 mg/day to 800 mg/day) were randomized to placebo or to continue on their current quetiapine extended-release (400 mg/day to 800 mg/day) for observation for possible relapse during the double-blind continuation (maintenance) phase. Stabilization during the open-label phase was defined as receiving a stable dose of quetiapine extended-release and having a CGI-Sâ¤4 and a PANSS score â¤60 from beginning to end of this open-label phase (with no increase of â¥10 points in PANSS total score). Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined in terms of a â¥30% increase in the PANSS Total score, or CGI-Improvement score of â¥6, or hospitalization due to worsening of schizophrenia, or need for any other antipsychotic medication. Patients on quetiapine extended-release experienced a statistically significant longer time to relapse than did patients on placebo (Figure 1).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release in the acute treatment of manic episodes was established in one 3-week, placebo-controlled trial (Study 1 in Table 27) in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or without psychotic features (N=316). Patients were hospitalized for a minimum of 4 days at randomization. Patients randomized to quetiapine extended-release received 300 mg on Day 1 and 600 mg on Day 2. Afterwards, the dose could be adjusted between 400 mg and 800 mg per day.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary rating instrument used for assessing manic symptoms in these trials was the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), an 11-item clinician-rated scale traditionally used to assess the degree of manic symptoms in a range from 0 (no manic features) to 60 (maximum score). Quetiapine extended-release was superior to placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score at week 3.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of SEROQUELÂ in the treatment of acute manic episodes was also established in 3 placebo-controlled trials in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder with manic episodes. These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and excluded patients with rapid cycling and mixed episodes. Of these trials, 2 were monotherapy (12-weeks) and 1 was adjunct therapy (3-weeks) to either lithium or divalproex. Key outcomes in these trials were change from baseline in the YMRS score at 3- and 12-weeks for monotherapy and at 3-weeks for adjunct therapy. Adjunct therapy is defined as the simultaneous initiation or subsequent administration of SEROQUELÂ with lithium or divalproex.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The results of the trials follow:</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In two 12-week trials (n=300, n=299) comparing SEROQUELÂ to placebo, SEROQUELÂ was superior to placebo in the reduction of the YMRS total score at weeks 3 and 12. The majority of patients in these trials taking SEROQUELÂ were dosed in a range between 400 mg/day and 800 mg/ day (Studies 2 and 3 in Table 27).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a 3-week placebo-controlled trial, 170 patients with bipolar mania (YMRS â¥ 20) were randomized to receive SEROQUELÂ or placebo as adjunct treatment to lithium or divalproex. Patients may or may not have received an adequate treatment course of lithium or divalproex prior to randomization. SEROQUELÂ was superior to placebo when added to lithium or divalproex alone in the reduction of YMRS total score. The majority of patients in this trial taking SEROQUELÂ were dosed in a range between 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day (Study 4 in Table 27).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release in the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) was extrapolated from a 3-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. Patients who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for a manic episode were randomized into one of three treatment groups: SEROQUELÂ 400 mg/day (n = 95), SEROQUELÂ 600 mg/day (n = 98), or placebo (n = 91). Study medication was initiated at 50 mg/day and on day 2 increased to 100 mg/day (divided doses given two or three times daily). Subsequently, the dose was titrated to a target dose of 400 mg/day or 600 mg/day using increments of 100 mg/day, given in divided doses two or three times daily. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total YMRS score. SEROQUELÂ 400 mg/day and 600 mg/day were superior to placebo in the reduction of YMRS total score (Study 5 in Table 27).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder in patients who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder was established in one 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N=280 outpatients). This study included patients with bipolar I and II disorder, and those with and without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to quetiapine extended-release were administered 50 mg on Day 1, 100 mg on Day 2, 200 mg on Day 3, and 300 mg on Day 4 and after.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), a 10-item clinician-rated scale with scores ranging from 0 (no depressive features) to 60 (maximum score). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. Quetiapine extended-release was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score at week 8 (Study 6 in Table 28).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of SEROQUELÂ for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder was established in 2 identical 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=1,045). These studies included patients with either bipolar I or II disorder and those with or without a rapid cycling course. Patients randomized to SEROQUELÂ were administered fixed doses of either 300 mg or 600 mg once daily.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary rating instrument used to assess depressive symptoms in these studies was the MADRS. The primary endpoint in both studies was the change from baseline in MADRS score at week 8. In both studies, SEROQUELÂ was superior to placebo in reduction of MADRS score at week 8 (Studies 7 and 8 in Table 28). In these studies, no additional benefit was seen with the 600 mg dose. For the 300 mg dose group, statistically significant improvements over placebo were seen in overall quality of life and satisfaction related to various areas of functioning, as measured using the Q-LESÂ­-Q(SF).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of SEROQUELÂ in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials in patients (n=1,326) who met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder (studies 9 and 10). The trials included patients whose most recent episode was manic, depressed, or mixed, with or without psychotic features. In the open-label phase, patients were required to be stable on SEROQUELÂ plus lithium or divalproex for at least 12-weeks in order to be randomized. On average, patients were stabilized for 15-weeks. In the randomization phase, patients continued treatment with lithium or divalproex and were randomized to receive either SEROQUELÂ (administered twice-daily totaling 400 mg/day to 800 mg/day) or placebo. Approximately 50% of the patients had discontinued from the SEROQUELÂ group by day 280% and 50% of the placebo group had discontinued by day 117 of double-blind treatment. The primary endpoint in these studies was time to recurrence of a mood event (manic, mixed or depressed episode). A mood event was defined as medication initiation or hospitalization for a mood episode; YMRS score â¥ 20 or MADRS score â¥ 20 at 2 consecutive assessments; or study discontinuation due to a mood event.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In both studies, SEROQUELÂ was superior to placebo in increasing the time to recurrence of any mood event (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The treatment effect was present for increasing time to recurrence of both manic and depressed episodes. The effect of SEROQUELÂ was independent of any specific subgroup (assigned mood stabilizer, sex, age, race, most recent bipolar episode, or rapid cycling course).</paragraph>

                     <title>14.3 Major Depressive
Disorder, Adjunctive Therapy to
Antidepressants</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in the treatment of MDD was demonstrated in two 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials (n=936). Quetiapine extended-release 150 mg/day or 300 mg/day was given as adjunctive therapy to existing antidepressant therapy in patients who had previously shown an inadequate response to at least one antidepressant. Quetiapine extended-release was administered as 50 mg/day on Days 1 and 2, and increased to 150 mg/day on Day 3 for both dose groups. On Day 5, the dose was increased to 300 mg/day in the 300 mg/day fixed-dose group. Inadequate response was defined as having continued depressive symptoms for the current episode [Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score of â¥ 20] despite using an antidepressant for 6-weeks at or above the minimally effective labelled dose. The mean HAM-D total score at entry was 24%, and 17% of patients scored 28 or greater. Patients were on various antidepressants prior to study entry including SSRIâs (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or citalopram), SNRIâs, (duloxetine and venlafaxine,) TCA (amitriptyline) and other (bupropion).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The primary endpoint in these trials was change from baseline to week 6 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS.), quetiapine extended-release 300 mg once daily as adjunctive treatment to other antidepressant therapy was superior to antidepressant alone in reduction of MADRS total score in both trials. Quetiapine extended-release 150 mg once daily as adjunctive treatment was superior to antidepressant therapy alone in reduction of MADRS total score in one trial (studies 1 and 2 in Table 29).</paragraph>

Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_ef3cd29d-1cd0-4cd3-9f8e-c125d422da31">Warnings and Precautions (5.2)</linkHtml>].</content>

                  <paragraph>Quetiapine extended-release tablets are indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for adolescents with schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder that may include other measures (psychological, educational, and social). Effectiveness and safety of quetiapine extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age for schizophrenia or less than 10 years of age for bipolar mania. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. The decision to prescribe atypical antipsychotic medication will depend upon the physicianâs assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patientâs symptoms <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#www.splportal.comLINK_1e6c70fa-b56d-430e-bee4-47ada165bf51">Indications and Usage (1.4)</linkHtml>].</content>
