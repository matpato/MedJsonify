                  <paragraph>Glucocorticoids, naturally occurring and synthetic, are adrenocortical steroids that are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Glucocorticoids cause varied metabolic effects. In addition, they modify the body's immune responses to diverse stimuli. Naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and cortisone), which also have sodium-retaining properties, are used as replacement therapy in adrenocortical deficiency states. Their synthetic analogs including dexamethasone are primarily used for their anti-inflammatory effects in disorders of many organ systems.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>At equipotent anti-inflammatory doses, dexamethasone almost completely lacks the sodium-retaining property of hydrocortisone and closely related derivatives of hydrocortisone.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Rare instances of anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids is indicated in patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to any unusual stress before, during, and after the stressful situation.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection 
  <br/>  Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can:
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Reduce resistance to new infections 
  <br/>  Exacerbate existing infections 
  <br/>  Increase the risk of disseminated infections 
  <br/>  Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections 
  <br/>  Mask some signs of infection
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Monitor for the development of infection and consider dexamethasone withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Do not administer dexamethasone by an intraarticular, intrabursal, intratendinous, or intralesional route in the presence of acute local infection.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Tuberculosis 
  <br/>  If dexamethasone is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged dexamethasone therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections 
  <br/>  Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including dexamethasone. In corticosteroid treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles:
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>If a dexamethasone-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. 
  <br/>  If a dexamethasone-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation 
  <br/>  Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including dexamethasone. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with dexamethasone. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Fungal Infections 
  <br/>  Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid dexamethasone use in the presence of such infections unless dexamethasone is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic dexamethasone therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, dexamethasone withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Amebiasis 
  <br/>  Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating dexamethasone in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Strongyloides Infestation 
  <br/>  Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram- negative septicemia.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Cerebral Malaria 
  <br/>  Avoid corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, in patients with cerebral malaria.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Vaccination 
  <br/>  Administration of live or live, attenuated vaccines is contraindicated in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered. However, the response to such vaccines cannot be predicted. Immunization procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement therapy, e.g., for Addison's disease.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Ophthalmic 
  <br/>  Use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist for patients who develop ocular symptoms or use corticosteroid-containing products for more than 6 weeks. The use of oral corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes. Corticosteroids should not be used in active ocular herpes simplex.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Kaposi’s Sarcoma 
  <br/>  Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi’s sarcoma.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Cardio-Renal 
  <br/>  Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, sodium and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Literature reports suggest an apparent association between use of corticosteroids and left ventricular free wall rupture after a recent myocardial infarction; therefore, therapy with corticosteroids should be used with great caution in these patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Endocrine 
  <br/>  Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment. Adrenocortical insufficiency may result from too rapid withdrawal of corticosteroids and may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. If the patient is receiving steroids already, dosage may have to be increased.
 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph/>
                  <paragraph>Metabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroid patients and increased in hyperthyroid patients. Changes in thyroid status of the patient may necessitate adjustment in dosage.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Corticosteroids decrease bone formation and increase bone resorption both through their effect on calcium regulation (i.e., decreasing absorption and increasing excretion) and inhibition of osteoblast function. This, together with a decrease in the protein matrix of the bone secondary to an increase in protein catabolism, and reduced sex hormone production, may lead to inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients and the development of osteoporosis at any age. Special consideration should be given to patients at increased risk of osteoporosis (e.g., postmenopausal women) before initiating corticosteroid therapy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of corticosteroids abruptly or without medical supervision. As prolonged use may cause adrenal insufficiency and make patients dependent on corticosteroids, they should advise any medical attendants that they are taking corticosteroids and they should seek medical advice at once should they develop an acute illness including fever or other signs of infection. Following prolonged therapy, withdrawal of corticosteroids may result in symptoms of the corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome including myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Persons who are on corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in the pediatric population are based on the well-established course of effect of corticosteroids, which is similar in pediatric and adult populations. Published studies provide evidence of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome (patients &gt;2 years of age), and aggressive lymphomas and leukemias (patients &gt;1 month of age). Other indications for pediatric use of corticosteroids, e.g., severe asthma and wheezing, are based on adequate and well-controlled trials conducted in adults, on the premises that the course of the diseases and their pathophysiology are considered to be substantially similar in both populations.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph/>
                        <paragraph>The adverse effects of corticosteroids in pediatric patients are similar to those in adults (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Like adults, pediatric patients should be carefully observed with frequent measurements of blood pressure, weight, height, intraocular pressure, and clinical evaluation for the presence of infection, psychosocial disturbances, thromboembolism, peptic ulcers, cataracts, and osteoporosis. Pediatric patients who are treated with corticosteroids by any route, including systemically administered corticosteroids, may experience a decrease in their growth velocity. This negative impact of corticosteroids on growth has been observed at low systemic doses and in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (i.e., cosyntropin stimulation and basal cortisol plasma levels). Growth velocity may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The linear growth of pediatric patients treated with corticosteroids should be monitored, and the potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained and the availability of treatment alternatives. In order to minimize the potential growth effects of corticosteroids, pediatric patients should be
 
  <content styleCode="italics">titrated</content>to the lowest effective dose.

Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. In particular, the increased risk of diabetes mellitus, fluid retention and hypertension in elderly patients treated with corticosteroids should be considered.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.</paragraph>
