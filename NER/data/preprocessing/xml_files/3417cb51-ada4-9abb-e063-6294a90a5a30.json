    "contraindications_original": "Tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare providers knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ). Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 5.1 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Do not exceed a daily dose of 300 mg tramadol. Do not use with other tramadol products. ( 2.1 ) For opioid-naïve and opioid non-tolerant patients, initiate tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets at a dose of 100 mg once daily, then titrate up by 100 mg increments every 5 days according to need and tolerance. ( 2.3 ) For patients currently on tramadol IR, calculate total 24-hr IR dose, and initiate tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets at a dose rounded down to next lower 100 mg increment; then adjust dose according to need and tolerance. See full prescribing information for instructions on conversion, titration, and maintenance of therapy. ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) Do not abruptly discontinue tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets in a physically-dependent patient. ( 2.5 ) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient's need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with tramadol hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose [ 2.2 , 5.1 , 5.3 , 5.7 ].",
