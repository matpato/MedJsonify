    "indications_original": "For control of severe nausea and vomiting.\n                  For the treatment of schizophrenia.\n                  Prochlorperazine maleate tablets are effective for the short-term treatment of generalized non-psychotic anxiety. However, prochlorperazine maleate tablets are not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety, because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (e.g., benzodiazepines).\n                  When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, prochlorperazine maleate tablets should not be administered at doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks because the use of prochlorperazine maleate tablets at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see\n \n  \n                        WARNINGS\n                     ).\n\n \n                  The effectiveness of prochlorperazine maleate tablets as treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in 4-week clinical studies of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder. This evidence does not predict that prochlorperazine maleate tablets will be useful in patients with other non-psychotic conditions in which anxiety, or signs that mimic anxiety, are found (e.g., physical illness, organic mental conditions, agitated depression, character pathologies, etc.).\n                  Prochlorperazine maleate tablets have not been shown effective in the management of behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation.",
    "contraindications_original": "ADULTS\n                  \n                  (For children’s dosage and administration, see below). Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients.\n                  \n                     Elderly Patients: In general, dosages in the lower range are sufficient for most elderly patients. Since they appear to be more susceptible to hypotension and neuromuscular reac­tions, such patients should be observed closely. Dosage should be tailored to the individual, response carefully moni­tored, and dosage adjusted accordingly. Dosage should be increased more gradually in elderly patients.\n\n \n                  \n                     1. To Control Severe Nausea and Vomiting:Adjust dosage to the response of the individual. Begin with the lowest recommended dosage.\n\n \n                  \n                     Oral Dosage-Tablets: Usually one 5 mg or 10 mg tablet, 3 times or 4 times daily. Daily dosages above 40 mg should be used only in resistant cases.\n\n \n                  \n                     2. In Adult Psychiatric Disorders: Adjust dosage to the response of the individual and according to the severity of the condition. Begin with the lowest recom­mended dose. Although response ordinarily is seen within a day or 2, longer treatment is usually required before maximal improvement is seen.\n\n \n                  \n                     Oral Dosage: \n                     Non-Psychotic-Anxiety-Usual dosage is 5 mg, 3 times or 4 times daily. Do not administer in doses of more than 20 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks.\n\n \n                  \n                     Psychotic Disorders including Schizophrenia-\n \n  In relatively mild conditions\n                     , as seen in private psychiatric practice or in outpatient clinics, dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg, 3 times or 4 times daily.\n\n \n                  \n                     In moderate to severe conditions, for hospitalized or adequate­ly supervised patients, usual starting dosage is 10 mg, 3 times or 4 times daily. Increase dosage gradually until symptoms are con­trolled or side effects become bothersome. When dosage is increased by small increments every 2 days or 3 days, side effects either do not occur or are easily controlled. Some patients respond satisfactorily on 50 mg to 75 mg daily.\n\n \n                  \n                     In more severe dis­turbances, optimum dosage is usually 100 mg to 150 mg daily.\n\n \n                  \n                     DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n                  \n                  \n                     CHILDREN\n                  \n                  \n                     Do not use in pediatric surgery.\n                  \n                  Children seem more prone to develop extrapyramidal reac­tions, even on moderate doses. Therefore, use lowest effec­tive dosage. Tell parents not to exceed prescribed dosage, since the possibility for adverse reactions increases as dosage rises. \n  \n                       Occasionally the patient may react to the drug with signs of restlessness and excitement; if this occurs, do not administer additional doses. Take particular precaution in administering the drug to children with acute illnesses or dehydration (see under Dystonias).\n \n                  \n                     1. Severe Nausea and Vomiting in Children:Prochlorperazine maleate tablets should not be used in pediatric patients under 20 pounds in weight or 2 years of age. It should not be used in conditions for which children’s dosages have not been established. Dosage and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the severity of the symptoms and the response of the patient. The duration of activity following intra­muscular administration may last up to 12 hours. Subsequent doses may be given by the same route if necessary.\n\n \n                  \n                     Oral Dosage: More than 1 day’s therapy is seldom necessary.\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 Weight\n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 Usual Dosage\n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 Not to Exceed\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              under 20 lbs not recommended\n                           \n                           \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              20 lbs to 29 lbs\n                           \n                           \n                              2½ mg, 1 time or 2 times a day\n                           \n                           \n                              7.5 mg per day\n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              30 lbs to 39 lbs\n                           \n                           \n                              2½ mg, 2 times or 3 times a day\n                           \n                           \n                              10 mg per day\n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              40 lbs to 85 lbs\n                           \n                           \n                              2½ mg, 3 times a day or 5 mg, 2 times a day\n                           \n                           \n                              15 mg per day\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     2.
