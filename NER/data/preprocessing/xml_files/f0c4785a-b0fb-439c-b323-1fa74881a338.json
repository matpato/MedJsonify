    "contraindications_original": "Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ibuprofen tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use ibuprofen tablets. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).\n                  \n                  After observing the response to initial therapy with ibuprofen tablets, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.\n                  \n                  Do not exceed 3200 mg total daily dose. If gastrointestinal complaints occur, administer ibuprofen tablets with meals or milk.\n                  \n                  \n                     Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including flare-ups of chronic disease:\n                  \n                  \n                     Suggested Dosage: 1200 mg to 3200 mg daily (300 mg four times a day, 400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg three times a day or four times a day). Individual patients may show a better response to 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a better mean response in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with 3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset potential increased risk. \n                  \n                  The dose should be tailored to each patient and may be lowered or raised depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiating drug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.\n                  \n                  In general, patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higher doses of ibuprofen tablets than do patients with osteoarthritis.\n                  \n                  The smallest dose of ibuprofen tablets that yields acceptable control should be employed. A linear blood level dose-response relationship exists with single doses up to 800 mg (see \n                  \n                     CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for effects of food on rate of absorption).\n                  \n                  The availability of three tablet strengths facilitates dosage adjustment. \n                  \n                  \n                     In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with ibuprofen tablets is some times seen in a few days to a week but most often is observed by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has been achieved, the patient's dose should be reviewed and adjusted as required.\n                  \n                      \n                  \n                  \n                     Mild to moderate pain:       \n                  \n                  400 mg every 4 to 6 hours as necessary for relief of pain. \n                  \n                  In controlled analgesic clinical trials, doses of ibuprofen tablets greater than 400 mg were no more effective than the 400 mg dose.\n                  \n                  \n                     Dysmenorrhea:\n                  \n                  For the treatment of dysmenorrhea, beginning with the earliest onset of such pain, ibuprofen tablets should be given in a dose of 400 mg every 4 hours as necessary for the relief of pain.",
