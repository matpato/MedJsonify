    "indications_original": "Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution is a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (beta 2 -agonist) indicated for: Long-term, twice daily (morning and evening) administration in the maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. ( 1.1 ) Important limitations of use: Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution is not indicated to treat acute deteriorations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ( 1.2 , 5.2 ) Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution is not indicated to treat asthma. ( 1.2 )",
    "contraindications_original": "The recommended dose of Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution is one 20 mcg unit-dose vial administered twice daily (morning and evening) by nebulization. A total daily dose greater than 40 mcg is not recommended.\n                  Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution should be administered by the orally inhaled route via a standard jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor. The safety and efficacy of Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution have been established in clinical trials when administered using the PARI-LC Plus® nebulizer (with a facemask or mouthpiece) and the PRONEB® Ultra compressor. The safety and efficacy of Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution delivered from non-compressor based nebulizer systems have not been established.\n                  Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution should always be stored in the foil pouch, and only removed IMMEDIATELY BEFORE USE. Contents of any partially used container should be discarded.\n                  If the recommended maintenance treatment regimen fails to provide the usual response, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of destabilization of COPD. Under these circumstances, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options should be considered.\n                  The drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of Formoterol Fumarate Inhalation Solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.",
