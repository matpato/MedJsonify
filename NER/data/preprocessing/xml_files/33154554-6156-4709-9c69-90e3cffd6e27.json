    "contraindications_original": "It is recommended that rifabutin capsules be administered at a dose of 300 mg once daily. For those patients with propensity to nausea, vomiting, or other gastrointestinal upset, administration of rifabutin at doses of 150 mg twice daily taken with food may be useful. Doses of Rifabutin capsules may be administered mixed with foods such as applesauce.\n                  For patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of rifabutin by 50%, if toxicity is suspected. No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Reduction of the dose of rifabutin may also be needed for patients receiving concomitant treatment with certain other drugs (see \n                        PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions\n                     ).\n                  Mild hepatic impairment does not require a dose modification. The pharmacokinetics of rifabutin in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is not known.",
