For infants and children, 3 drops are suggested because of the smaller capacity of the ear canal.\n                  The patient should lie with the affected ear upward and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for 5 minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.\n                  If preferred, a cotton wick may be inserted into the canal and then the cotton may be saturated with the suspension. This wick should be kept moist by adding further suspension every 4 hours. The wick should be replaced at least once every 24 hours.\n                  \n                     SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING.",
