Taking the larger portion of the oral daily dose at bedtime may minimize transient adjustment effects of dry mouth and drowsiness. The therapeutic doses most commonly employed have ranged from 0.2 mg to 0.6 mg per day given in divided doses. Studies have indicated that 2.4 mg is the maximum effective daily dose, but doses as high as this have rarely been employed. \n       \n \n  \n                     \n                        Renal Impairment\n        \n  \n   \n                     Patients with renal impairment may benefit from a lower initial dose.
