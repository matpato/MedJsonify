    "indications_original": "Doxycycline hyclate tablets, USP are indicated for use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing to promote attachment level gain and to reduce pocket depth in patients with adult periodontitis.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate tablets and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline hyclate tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture susceptibility information is available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANT MICROORGANISMS.\n                  Doxycycline hyclate tablets 20 mg twice daily as an adjunct following scaling and root planing may be administered for up to 9 months. Doxycycline hyclate tablets should be taken twice daily at 12 hour intervals, usually in the morning and evening. It is recommended that if doxycycline hyclate tablets is taken close to meal times, allow at least one hour prior to or two hours after meals. Safety beyond 12 months and efficacy beyond 9 months have not been established.\n                  Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with the tablets is recommended to wash down the drug and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration.
