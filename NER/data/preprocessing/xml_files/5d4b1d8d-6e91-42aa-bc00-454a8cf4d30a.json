Protect from light and keep container tightly closed.\n                  Females should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "Finasteride tablets are contraindicated in the following:\n                  \n                     \n                        •Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.\n                     \n                        •Pregnancy. Finasteride use is contraindicated in females when they are or may potentially be pregnant. Because of the ability of Type II 5α-reductase inhibitors to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), finasteride may cause abnormalities of the external genitalia of a male fetus of a pregnant female who receives finasteride. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while taking this drug, the pregnant female should be apprised of the potential hazard to the male fetus. [See also Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.1), and How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16).] In female rats, low doses of finasteride administered during pregnancy have produced abnormalities of the external genitalia in male offspring."
