    "indications_original": "Clomiphene citrate is indicated for the treatment of ovulatory dysfunction in women desiring pregnancy. Impediments to achieving pregnancy must be excluded or adequately treated before beginning clomiphene citrate therapy. Those patients most likely to achieve success with clomiphene therapy include patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (see\n \n  WARNINGS:\n \n  Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome), amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, psychogenic amenorrhea, post-oral-contraceptive amenorrhea, and certain cases of secondary amenorrhea of undetermined etiology.\n\n \n                  Properly timed coitus in relationship to ovulation is important. A basal body temperature graph or other appropriate tests may help the patient and her physician determine if ovulation occurred. Once ovulation has been established, each course of clomiphene citrate should be started on or about the 5th day of the cycle. Long-term cyclic therapy is not recommended beyond a total of about six cycles (including three ovulatory cycles). (See\n \n  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONand\n \n  PRECAUTIONS.)\n\n \n                  \n                       Clomiphene citrate is indicated only in patients with demonstrated ovulatory dysfunction who meet the conditions described below:\n \n                  \n                     Patients who are not pregnant.\n                     Patients without ovarian cysts. Clomiphene citrate should not be used in patients with ovarian enlargement except those with polycystic ovary syndrome. Pelvic examination is necessary prior to the first and each subsequent course of clomiphene citrate treatment.\n                     Patients without abnormal vaginal bleeding. If abnormal vaginal bleeding is present, the patient should be carefully evaluated to ensure that neoplastic lesions are not present.\n                     Patients with normal liver function.\n                  \n                  \n                  In addition, patients selected for clomiphene citrate therapy should be evaluated in regard to the following:\n                  \n                  \n                     \n                        Estrogen Levels.Patients should have adequate levels of endogenous estrogen (as estimated from vaginal smears, endometrial biopsy, assay of urinary estrogen, or from bleeding in response to progesterone). Reduced estrogen levels, while less favorable, do not preclude successful therapy.\n \n  \n                     \n                        Primary Pituitary or Ovarian Failure.Clomiphene citrate therapy cannot be expected to substitute for specific treatment of other causes of ovulatory failure.\n \n  \n                     \n                        Endometriosis and Endometrial Carcinoma.The incidence of endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma increases with age as does the incidence of ovulatory disorders. Endometrial biopsy should always be performed prior to clomiphene citrate therapy in this population.\n \n  \n                     \n                        Other Impediments to Pregnancy.Impediments to pregnancy can include thyroid disorders, adrenal disorders, hyperprolactinemia, and male factor infertility.\n \n  \n                     \n                        Uterine Fibroids.Caution should be exercised when using clomiphene citrate in patients with uterine fibroids due to the potential for further enlargement of the fibroids.\n \n  \n                  \n                  \n                       There are no adequate or well-controlled studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of clomiphene citrate in the treatment of male infertility. In addition, testicular tumors and gynecomastia have been reported in males using clomiphene. The cause and effect relationship between reports of testicular tumors and the administration of clomiphene citrate is not known.\n \n                  Although the medical literature suggests various methods, there is no universally accepted standard regimen for combined therapy (i.e., clomiphene citrate in conjunction with other ovulation-inducing drugs). Similarly, there is no standard clomiphene citrate regimen for ovulation induction\n \n  in vitrofertilization programs to produce ova for fertilization and reintroduction. Therefore, clomiphene citrate is not recommended for these uses.",
