    "indications_original": "Clindamycin hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. \n  \n                       Clindamycin hydrochloride capsules are also indicated in the treatment of seri­ous infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate.

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
