    "indications_original": "VYONDYS 53 is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on an increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle observed in patients treated with VYONDYS 53 [see Clinical Studies (14)].  Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.",
    "contraindications_original": "Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting VYONDYS 53 ( 2.1 ) 30 milligrams per kilogram once weekly ( 2.2 ) Administer as an intravenous infusion over 35 to 60 minutes via an in-line 0.2 micron filter ( 2.2 , 2.4 ) Dilution required prior to administration ( 2.3 )",
    "adverseReactions_original": "VYONDYS 53 is contraindicated in patients with a serious hypersensitivity reaction to golodirsen or to any of the inactive ingredients in VYONDYS 53. Anaphylaxis has occurred in patients receiving VYONDYS 53 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."
