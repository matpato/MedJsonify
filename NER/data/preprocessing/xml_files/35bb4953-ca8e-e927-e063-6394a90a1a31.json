    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "12.1 How Supplied\n                  \n                  Xiclo™ Transdermal Patch comes in a sealed pouch bag. Each patch is 2 in x 2 in (5.08 cm x 10.16 cm) and consists of an adhesive side containing the active/inactive ingredients and an outer surface backing layer. The adhesive side is covered with a removable, clear, unprinted, plastic film. The outer surface of the backing layer is imprinted with the Xiclo™ Transdermal Patch logo.\n                  Xiclo™ Transdermal Patch is available as a unit box containing 10 patches (5 pouch bags). NDC 83295-5500-1\n                  \n                     12.2 Storage\n                  \n                  Store unit box between 69\n  o-77\n  o F (20\n  o-25\n  o C).

Avoid contact with your eyes, nose, or mouth. Keep used and unused patches out of the reach of children and pets. Pouch bags are not child resistant. Wash hands with soap and water after handling the patches. If irritation or a burning sensation occurs during application, remove the patch and do not reapply until the irritation subsides. After use, fold patches so that the adhesive sticks to itself, then safely discard used patches where children and pets cannot get to them.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "Xiclo™ Transdermal Patch is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as diclofenac. Diclofenac is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. History of asthma, uticaria, or allergic-type reactions after absorbing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should also be considered."
