    "indications_original": "Metolazone is indicated for the treatment of salt and water retention including:\n                  •  edema accompanying congestive heart failure;\n                  •  edema accompanying renal diseases, including the nephrotic syndrome and states of diminished renal function.\n                  Metolazone is also indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs of a different class. Mykrox\n \n  ®tablets, a more rapidly available form of metolazone, are intended for the treatment of new patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A dose titration is necessary if Mykrox\n \n  ®tablets are to be substituted for Zaroxolyn\n \n  ®tablets and other formulations of metolazone that share its slow and incomplete bioavailability, in the treatment of hypertension.",
    "contraindications_original": "Effective dosage of metolazone tablets should be individualized according to indication and patient response. A single daily dose is recommended. Therapy with metolazone tablets should be titrated to gain an initial therapeutic response and to determine the minimal dose possible to maintain the desired therapeutic response.",
