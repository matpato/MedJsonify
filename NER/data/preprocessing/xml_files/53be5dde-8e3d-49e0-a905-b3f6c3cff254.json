Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.\n                  Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.\n                  There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see \n                           WARNINGS\n                        ].\n                  \n                  Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets.

The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient [see \n                           WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse\n                        , \n                           Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression\n                        , \n                           Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants\n                        ].\n                  \n                  Consider prescribing naloxone when the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose.\n                  \n                     \n                     Initial Dosage\n                  \n                  \n                     Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets as the First Opioid Analgesic\n                  \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              5 mg/325 mg\n                           \n                           \n                              Initiate treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in a dosing range of 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. The total daily dosage should not exceed 8 tablets.\n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              7.5 mg/325 mg\n                              10 mg/325 mg\n                           \n                           \n                              Initiate treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with 1 tablet every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. The total daily dosage should not exceed 6 tablets.\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     Conversion from Other Opioids to Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets\n                  \n                  There is inter-patient variability in the potency of opioid drugs and opioid formulations. Therefore, a conservative approach is advised when determining the total daily dosage of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. It is safer to underestimate a patient’s 24-hour Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage than to overestimate the 24-hour Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage and manage an adverse reaction due to overdose.\n                  \n                     Conversion from Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets to Extended-Release Hydrocodone\n                  \n                  The relative bioavailability of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets compared to extended-release hydrocodone is unknown, so conversion to extended-release hydrocodone may lead to increased risk of excessive sedation and respiratory depression.\n                  \n                     Titration and Maintenance of Therapy\n                  \n                  Individually titrate Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see \n                           WARNINGS\n                        ]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.\n                  If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see \n                           WARNINGS\n                        ]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.\n                  \n                     Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets\n                  \n                  Do not abruptly discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.\n                  When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with co-morbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.\n                  There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.\n                  It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.\n                  When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see \n                           WARNINGS; Withdrawal\n                        , \n                           DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE\n                        ].",
