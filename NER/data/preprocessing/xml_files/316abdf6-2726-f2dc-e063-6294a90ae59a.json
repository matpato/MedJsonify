For patients with TG less than 400 mg\n \n  /dL (<4.5 mmol\n \n  /L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation:\n\n \n                  LDL-C = total-C – [0.2 × (TG) + HDL-C]\n                  For TG levels >400 mg/dL (>4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less accurate and LDL-C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation. In hypertriglyceridemic patients, LDL-C may be low or normal despite elevated total-C. In such cases, lovastatin tablets USP are not indicated.\n                  The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Treatment Guidelines are summarized below:\n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 †CHD, coronary heart disease \n      \n                              \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 †\n                                 †Some authorities recommend use of LDL-lowering drugs in this category if an LDL-C level of <100 mg/dL cannot be achieved by therapeutic lifestyle changes.

Moreover, cholesterol and other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway are essential components for fetal development, including synthesis of steroids and cell membranes. Because of the ability of inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase such as lovastatin to decrease the synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy and in nursing mothers.\n \n  Lovastatin should be administered to women of childbearing age only when such patients are highly unlikely to conceive.If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, lovastatin should be discontinued immediately and the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus\n \n  (see\n  \n   PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy)."
