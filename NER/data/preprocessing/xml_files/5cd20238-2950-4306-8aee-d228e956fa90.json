    "contraindications_original": "For the Relief of Symptoms Associated with Diabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis)\n                  \n                  If only the earliest manifestations of diabetic gastric stasis are present, oral administration of metoclopramide may be initiated. However, if severe symptoms are present, therapy should begin with metoclopramide injection (IM or IV). Doses of 10 mg may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1- to 2-minute period.\n                  Administration of metoclopramide injection up to 10 days may be required before symptoms subside, at which time oral administration of metoclopramide may be instituted. The physician should make a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits prior to prescribing further metoclopramide treatment.\n                  \n                     For the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with Emetogenic Cancer Chemotherapy\n                  \n                  Intravenous infusions should be made slowly over a period of not less than 15 minutes, 30 minutes before beginning cancer chemotherapy and repeated every 2 hours for two doses, then every 3 hours for three doses.\n                  The initial two doses should be 2 mg/kg if highly emetogenic drugs such as cisplatin or dacarbazine are used alone or in combination. For less emetogenic regimens, 1 mg/kg per dose may be adequate.\n                  For doses in excess of 10 mg, metoclopramide injection should be diluted in 50 mL of a parenteral solution.\n                  The preferred parenteral solution is Sodium Chloride Injection (normal saline), which when combined with metoclopramide injection, can be stored frozen for up to 4 weeks. Metoclopramide injection is degraded when admixed and frozen with Dextrose-5% in Water. Metoclopramide injection diluted in Sodium Chloride Injection, Dextrose-5% in Water, Dextrose-5% in 0.45% Sodium Chloride, Ringer's Injection, or Lactated Ringer's Injection may be stored up to 48 hours (without freezing) after preparation if protected from light. All dilutions may be stored unprotected from light under normal light conditions up to 24 hours after preparation.\n                  If acute dystonic reactions should occur, inject 50 mg Benadryl®(diphenhydramine hydrochloride) intramuscularly, and the symptoms usually will subside.\n                  \n                     For the Prevention of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting\n                  \n                  Metoclopramide injection should be given intramuscularly near the end of surgery. The usual adult dose is 10 mg; however, doses of 20 mg may be used.\n                  \n                     To Facilitate Small Bowel Intubation\n                  \n                  If the tube has not passed the pylorus with conventional maneuvers in 10 minutes, a single dose (undiluted) may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1- to 2-minute period.\n                  The recommended single dose is: Pediatric patients above 14 years of age and adults — 10 mg metoclopramide base. Pediatric patients (6 to 14 years of age) — 2.5 to 5 mg metoclopramide base; (under 6 years of age) — 0.1 mg/kg metoclopramide base.\n                  \n                     To Aid in Radiological Examinations\n                  \n                  In patients where delayed gastric emptying interferes with radiological examination of the stomach and/or small intestine, a single dose may be administered slowly by the intravenous route over a 1- to 2-minute period.\n                  For dosage, see intubation above.\n                  \n                     Use in Patients With Renal or Hepatic Impairment\n                  \n                  Since metoclopramide is excreted principally through the kidneys, in those patients whose creatinine clearance is below 40 mL/min, therapy should be initiated at approximately one-half the recommended dosage. Depending upon clinical efficacy and safety considerations, the dosage may be increased or decreased as appropriate.\n                  See \n                        OVERDOSAGE\n                     section for information regarding dialysis.\n                  Metoclopramide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, except for simple conjugation.

    "adverseReactions_original": "Metoclopramide should not be used whenever stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous, e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.\n                  Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because the drug may cause a hypertensive crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor. Such hypertensive crises may be controlled by phentolamine.\n                  Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or intolerance to the drug.\n                  Metoclopramide should not be used in epileptics or patients receiving other drugs which are likely to cause extrapyramidal reactions, since the frequency and severity of seizures or extrapyramidal reactions may be increased."
