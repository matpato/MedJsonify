If hypokalemia is the result of diuretic therapy, consideration should be given to the use of a lower dose of diuretic, which may be sufficient without leading to hypokalemia.\n                     For the prevention of hypokalemia in patients who would be at particular risk if hypokalemia were to develop, eg, digitalized patients or patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias.\n                  \n                  The use of potassium salts in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension is often unnecessary when such patients have a normal dietary pattern and when low doses of the diuretic are used.

    "contraindications_original": "The usual dietary intake of potassium by the average adult is 50 to 100 mEq per day. Potassium depletion sufficient to cause hypokalemia usually requires the loss of 200 or more mEq of potassium from the total body store.\n                  Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient. The dose for the prevention of hypokalemia is typically in the range of 20 mEq per day. Doses of 40 to 100 mEq per day or more are used for the treatment of potassium depletion. Dosage should be divided if more than 20 mEq per day is given such that no more than 20 mEq is given in a single dose.\n                  Each Potassium Chloride Extended-Release Tablet, USP 20 mEq provides 20 mEq of potassium.\n                  Each Potassium Chloride Extended-Release Tablet, USP 10 mEq provides 10 mEq of potassium.\n                  Potassium Chloride Tablets should be taken with meals and with a glass of water or other liquid. This product should not be taken on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation (see \n  \n                        WARNINGS\n                     ).\n \n                  Patients having difficulty swallowing whole tablets may try one of the following alternate methods of administration:\n                  \n                     Break the tablet in half, and take each half separately with a glass of water.\n                     Prepare an aqueous (water) suspension as follows:\n\t\n   \n                           Place the whole tablet(s) in approximately 1/2 glass of water (4 fluid ounces).\n                           Allow approximately 2 minutes for the tablet(s) to disintegrate.\n                           Stir for about half a minute after the tablet(s) has disintegrated.\n                           Swirl the suspension and consume the entire contents of the glass immediately by drinking or by the use of a straw.\n                           Add another 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.\n                           Then, add an additional 1 fluid ounce of water, swirl, and consume immediately.\n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Aqueous suspension of potassium chloride that is not taken immediately should be discarded.

    "adverseReactions_original": "Potassium supplements are contraindicated in patients with hyperkalemia since a further increase in serum potassium concentration in such patients can produce cardiac arrest. Hyperkalemia may complicate any of the following conditions: chronic renal failure, systemic acidosis, such as diabetic acidosis, acute dehydration, extensive tissue breakdown as in severe burns, adrenal insufficiency, or the administration of a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg, spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) (see \n  \n                        OVERDOSAGE\n                     ).\n \n                  Controlled-release formulations of potassium chloride have produced esophageal ulceration in certain cardiac patients with esophageal compression due to enlarged left atrium.
