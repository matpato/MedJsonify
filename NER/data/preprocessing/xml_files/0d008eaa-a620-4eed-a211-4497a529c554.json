    "contraindications_original": "Adults\n                     The dose of clonidine hydrochloride USP must be adjusted according to the patient's individual blood pressure response. The following is a general guide to its administration. \n                     \n                     Initial Dose\n                     0.1 mg tablet twice daily (morning and bedtime). Elderly patients may benefit from a lower initial dose.\n                     \n                     Maintenance Dose\n                     Further increments of 0.1 mg per day may be made at weekly intervals if necessary until the desired response is achieved. Taking the larger portion of the oral daily dose at bedtime may minimize transient adjustment effects of dry mouth and drowsiness. The therapeutic doses most commonly employed have ranged from 0.2 mg to 0.6 mg per day given in divided doses. Studies have indicated that 2.4 mg is the maximum effective daily dose, but doses as high as this have rarely been employed. \n                     \n                     Renal Impairment\n                     Patients with renal impairment may benefit from a lower initial dose. Patients should be carefully monitored.Since only a minimal amount of clonidine is removed during routine hemodialysis, there is no need to give supplemental clonidine followingdialysis.",
