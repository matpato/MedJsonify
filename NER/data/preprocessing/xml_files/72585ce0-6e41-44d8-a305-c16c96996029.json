    "indications_original": "To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate capsules and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline hyclate capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. \n                  \n                     Treatment: \n                     Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: \n                  \n                     Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.\n    \n                     Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n    \n                     Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.\n    \n                     Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydophila psittaci.\n    \n                     Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence.\n    \n                     Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.\n    \n                     Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.\n    \n                     Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.\n    \n                     Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis. \n                  \n                  Doxycycline is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms: \n                  \n                     Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.\n    \n                     Plague due to Yersinia pestis.\n    \n                     Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis.\n    \n                     Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae.\n    \n                     Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus.\n    \n                     Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin).\n    \n                     Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis.\n                     Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. \n                  \n                  Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to doxycycline, culture and susceptibility testing are recommended. \n                  Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative bacteria, when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: \n                  \n                     \n                        Escherichia coli.\n    \n                     \n                        Enterobacter aerogenes.\n    \n                     \n                        Shigella species.\n    \n                     \n                        Acinetobacter species.\n    \n                     Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae.\n    \n                     Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. \n                  \n                  Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: \n                  \n                     Upper respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n    \n                     Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis, including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure): to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis. \n                  \n                  When penicillin is contraindicated, doxycycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: \n                  \n                     Uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n    \n                     Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum.\n    \n                     Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenu\n                        e.\n    \n                     Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes.\n    \n                     Vincent’s infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme.\n    \n                     Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii.\n    \n                     Infections caused by Clostridium species. \n                  \n                  In acute intestinal amebiasis, doxycycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. \n                  In severe acne, doxycycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. \n                  \n                     Prophylaxis:\n                     Doxycycline is indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum in short-term travelers (< 4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine resistant strains (see \n                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n                      section and Information for Patients\n                      subsection of the \n                        PRECAUTIONS\n                      section).",
    "contraindications_original": "The usual dosage and frequency of administration of doxycycline differs from that of the other tetracyclines. Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects.\n                  \n                     Adults: \n                  \n                  The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended. \n                  \n                     Pediatric Patients:\n                  \n                  For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose (see \n                        WARNINGS\n                      and \n                        PREACAUTIONS\n                     ). \n                  For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule is 4.4 mg/kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg/kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used. \n                  The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage. \n                  When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days. \n                  Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration (see \n                        ADVERSE REACTIONS\n                     ). \n                  If gastric irritation occurs, it is recommended that doxycycline be given with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk. \n                  Studies to date have indicated that administration of doxycycline at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of doxycycline in patients with renal impairment. \n                  Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults (except anorectal infections in men): 100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days.

For children over 8 years of age, the recommended dose is 2 mg/kg given once daily up to the adult dose. Prophylaxis should begin 1 to 2 days before travel to the malarious area. Prophylaxis should be continued daily during travel in the malarious area and for 4 weeks after the traveler leaves the malarious area. \n                  Inhalational anthrax (post-exposure): \n                  ADULTS: 100 mg of doxycycline, by mouth, twice a day for 60 days. \n                   CHILDREN: weighing less than 45 kg; 2.2 mg/kg of body weight by mouth, twice a day for 60 days.
