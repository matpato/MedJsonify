    "indications_original": "Perphenazine is indicated for use in the treatment of schizophrenia and for the control of severe nausea and vomiting in adults.\n                  Perphenazine has not been shown effective for the management of behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation.",
    "contraindications_original": "Dosage must be individualized and adjusted according to the severity of the condition and the response obtained. As with all potent drugs, the best dose is the lowest dose that will produce the desired clinical effect. Since extrapyramidal symptoms increase in frequency and severity with increased dosage, it is important to employ the lowest effective dose. These symptoms have disappeared upon reduction of dosage, withdrawal of the drug, or administration of an antiparkinsonian agent.\n                  Prolonged administration of doses exceeding 24 mg daily should be reserved for hospitalized patients or patients under continued observation for early detection and management of adverse reactions. An antiparkinsonian agent, such as trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride or benztropine mesylate, is valuable in controlling drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.\n                  Suggested dosages for various conditions follow:",

Total body ice-packing is recommended for such a reaction; antipyretics may also be useful."
