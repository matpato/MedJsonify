In STEMI patients presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset, the loading dose of prasugrel tablets was administered at the time of diagnosis, although most received prasugrel tablets at the time of PCI \n  [see\n                     \n                        Clinical Studies (14)\n                     \n                     ]. For the small fraction of patients that required urgent CABG after treatment with prasugrel tablets, the risk of significant bleeding was substantial.\n \n                  Although it is generally recommended that antiplatelet therapy be administered promptly in the management of ACS because many cardiovascular events occur within hours of initial presentation, in a trial of 4033 NSTEMI patients, no clear benefit was observed when prasugrel tablets loading dose was administered prior to diagnostic coronary angiography compared to at the time of PCI; however, risk of bleeding was increased with early administration in patients undergoing PCI or early CABG.\n                  \n                     Dosing in Low Weight Patients\n                     \nCompared to patients weighing ≥60 kg, patients weighing <60 kg have an increased exposure to the active metabolite of prasugrel and an increased risk of bleeding on a 10 mg once daily maintenance dose. Consider lowering the maintenance dose to 5 mg in patients <60 kg. The effectiveness and safety of the 5 mg dose have not been prospectively studied \n  [see\n                     \n                        Warnings and Precautions (5.1)\n                     \n                     ,\n                     \n                        Adverse Reactions (6.1)\n                     \n                     , and\n                     \n                        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)\n                     \n                     ].",
