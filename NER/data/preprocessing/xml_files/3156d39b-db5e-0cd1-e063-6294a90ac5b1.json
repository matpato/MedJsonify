    "indications_original": "Hypertension\n                     \n                       Atenolol tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol. \n  \n                       Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). \n  \n                       Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. \n  \n                       Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. \n  \n                       Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. \n  \n                       Atenolol tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis \n   \n                        \n                     Atenolol tablets are indicated for the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris. \n  \n                     \n                          Acute Myocardial Infarction\n  \n                     \n                       Atenolol tablets are indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality. Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient’s clinical condition allows. (See\n \n  \n                        \n                           DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n                        ,\n  \n   \n                           CONTRAINDICATIONS\n                        \n                     , and\n \n  \n                        \n                           WARNINGS\n                        \n                     .) In general, there is no basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS-1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mmHg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta-blockade. As noted above, some subgroups (e.g., elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mmHg) seemed less likely to benefit.",
    "contraindications_original": "Hypertension\n                     \n                       The initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit. \n  \n                       Atenolol may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents including thiazide-type diuretics, hydralazine, prazosin, and alpha-methyldopa.\n \n  \n                        \n                          Angina Pectoris\n  \n                     \n                       The initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. If an optimal response is not achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. \n  \n                       Twenty-four hour control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 mg to 100 mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg. \n  \n                     \n                     Acute Myocardial Infarction\n                     \n                       In patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with atenolol I.V. injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient's hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. Atenolol I.V. injection should be administered under carefully controlled conditions including monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. Dilutions of atenolol I.V. injection in dextrose injection, sodium chloride injection, or sodium chloride and dextrose injection may be used. These admixtures are stable for 48 hours if they are not used immediately. \n  \n                       In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), atenolol tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6 to 9 days or until discharge from the hospital. If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, atenolol should be discontinued. (See full prescribing information prior to initiating therapy with atenolol tablets.) \n  \n                       Data from other beta-blocker trials suggest that if there is any question concerning the use of I.V. beta-blocker or clinical estimate that there is a contraindication, the I.V. beta-blocker may be eliminated and patients fulfilling the safety criteria may be given atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once a day for at least seven days (if the I.V. dosing is excluded). \n  \n                       Although the demonstration of efficacy of atenolol is based entirely on data from the first seven postinfarction days, data from other beta-blocker trials suggest that treatment with beta-blockers that are effective in the postinfarction setting may be continued for one to three years if there are no contraindications. \n  \n                       Atenolol is an additional treatment to standard coronary care unit therapy.\n \n  \n                        \n                          Elderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment\n  \n                     \n                       Atenolol is excreted by the kidneys; consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function. Atenolol excretion would be expected to decrease with advancing age. \n  \n                       No significant accumulation of atenolol occurs until creatinine clearance falls below 35 mL/min/1.73 m\n \n  2. Accumulation of atenolol and prolongation of its half-life were studied in subjects with creatinine clearance between 5 mL/min and 105 mL/min. Peak plasma levels were significantly increased in subjects with creatinine clearances below 30 mL/min. \n  \n                       The following maximum oral dosages are recommended for elderly, renally-impaired patients and for patients with renal impairment due to other causes:\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           Creatinine Clearance \n        (mL/min/1.73 m\n    \n     2) \n     \n                           \n                           Atenolol Elimination \n        Half-Life \n       (h) \n     \n                           \n                           Maximum \n       Dosage \n     \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           15-35 \n     \n                           \n                           16-27 \n     \n                           \n                           50 mg daily \n     \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           <15  \n     \n                           \n                           >27  \n     \n                           \n                           25 mg daily  \n     \n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                  Some renally-impaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a lower starting dose of atenolol: 25 mg given as one tablet a day.
