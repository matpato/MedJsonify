    "indications_original": "Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules are indicated for the management of the symptom complex of tension (or muscle contraction) headache when non-opioid analgesic and alternative treatments are inadequate. \n                  \n                     Limitations of Use\n                  \n                  Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids and butalbital, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid, non-barbiturate analgesics]:\n                  \n                     \n                        •Have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated,\n                     \n                        •Have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.\n                  \n                  Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.",
    "contraindications_original": "• Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) • Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) • Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available. ( 2.1 ) • Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) • Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) • Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient’s need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient’s risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) • Initiate treatment with one or two capsules every 4 hours as needed for pain and at the lowest dose necessary to achieve adequate analgesia. Titrate the dose based upon the individual patient’s response to their initial dose of Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules. Total daily dosage should not exceed 6 capsules. ( 2.3 , 5 ) • Do not abruptly discontinue Butalbital, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Codeine Phosphate Capsules in a physically dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide.
