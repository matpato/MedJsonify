    "indications_original": "SUBLOCADE is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe opioid use disorder in patients who have initiated treatment with a single dose of a transmucosal buprenorphine product or who are already being treated with buprenorphine.\n                  SUBLOCADE should be used as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support.",
    "contraindications_original": "SUBLOCADE is for healthcare provider preparation and administration only. ( 2.1 ) SUBLOCADE is administered only by subcutaneous injection in the abdomen, thigh, buttock, or back of the upper arm. ( 2.1 ) Strongly consider prescribing naloxone at the time SUBLOCADE is initiated or renewed because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose. ( 2.2 ) Patients not currently taking buprenorphine should receive an initial dose (e.g. 4 mg) of transmucosal buprenorphine before administering the first injection of SUBLOCADE. Monitor patients in a healthcare setting after injection with SUBLOCADE to assess for symptoms of worsening withdrawal or sedation. Patients' symptoms should be stable or improving prior to release from the healthcare setting. ( 2.3 ) The second injection of SUBLOCADE may be administered as early as one week after the first injection. ( 2.3 ) Injection sites should be rotated between doses. ( 2.3 ) The recommended dose of SUBLOCADE is two initial doses of 300 mg followed by 100 mg monthly maintenance doses. ( 2.3 ) Increasing the maintenance dose to 300 mg monthly may be considered for patients in which the benefits outweigh the risks. ( 2.3 ) Examine the injection site for signs of infection or evidence of tampering or attempts to remove the depot. ( 2.4 ) See Full Prescribing Information for administration instructions. ( 2.5 )",
