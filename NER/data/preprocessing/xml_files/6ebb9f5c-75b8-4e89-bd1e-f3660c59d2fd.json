    "indications_original": "Clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis in subjects 18 years of age and older. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Do not use on the face, axillae or groin. ( 1.2 ) Avoid any contact with the eyes and lips. ( 1.2 )",
    "contraindications_original": "Clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% is for topical use only, and not for ophthalmic, oral or intravaginal use.\n                  Clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, should be applied onto dry (not wet) scalp once a day in a thin film to the affected areas only, and left in place for 15 minutes before lathering and rinsing.\n                  The total dosage should not exceed 50 g (50 mL or 1.75 fl. oz.) per week.\n                  Move the hair away from the scalp so that one of the affected areas is exposed. Position the bottle over the lesion. Apply a small amount of the shampoo directly onto the lesion, letting the product naturally flow from the bottle (gently squeeze the bottle), avoiding any contact of the product with the facial skin, eyes or lips. In case of contact, rinse thoroughly with water. Spread the product so that the entire lesion is covered with a thin uniform film. Massage gently into the lesion and repeat for additional lesion(s). Wash your hands after applying clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%.\n                  Leave the shampoo in place for 15 minutes, then add water, lather and rinse thoroughly all parts of the scalp and body that came in contact with the shampoo (e.g., hands, face, neck and shoulders). Avoid contact with eyes and lips. Minimize contact to non-affected areas of the body. Although no additional shampoo is necessary to cleanse your hair, you may use a non-medicated shampoo if desired.\n                  Treatment should be limited to 4 consecutive weeks. As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved. If complete disease control is not achieved after 4 weeks of treatment with clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, treatment with a less potent topical steroid may be substituted. If no improvement is seen within 4 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary.\n                  Clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, should not be used with occlusive dressings (shower cap or bathing cap) unless directed by a physician.",
