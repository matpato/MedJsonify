Your doctor will know if amlodipine besylate tablets are right for you.\n                  \n                     What is amlodipine besylate? \n                  \n                  Amlodipine besylate is a type of medicine known as a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and a type of chest pain called angina. It can be used by itself or with other medicines to treat these conditions.\n                  \n                     High Blood Pressure (hypertension)\n                  \n                  High blood pressure comes from blood pushing too hard against your blood vessels. Amlodipine besylate relaxes your blood vessels, which lets your blood flow more easily and helps lower your blood pressure. Drugs that lower blood pressure lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack.\n                  \n                     Angina \n                  \n                  Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Amlodipine besylate can relieve this pain. \n                  \n                     Who should not use amlodipine besylate tablets?\n                  \n                  Do not use amlodipine besylate tablets if you are allergic to the active ingredient amlodipine, or to the inactive ingredients. Your doctor or pharmacist can give you a list of these ingredients.\n                  \n                     What should I tell my doctor before taking amlodipine besylate tablets?\n                  \n                  Tell your doctor about any prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking, including natural or herbal remedies.\n                  Tell your doctor if you:\n                  \n                     \n                        •ever had heart disease\n                     \n                        •ever had liver problems\n                     \n                        •are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant.
