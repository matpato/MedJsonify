    "contraindications_original": "The initial dosage of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL), Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (15 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL), Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (20 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) or Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (25 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) may vary from 2.5 mL to 30 mL (5 to 60 mg prednisolone base) per day, 1.67 mL to 20 mL (5 to 60 mg prednisolone base) per day, 1.25 mL to 15 mL (5 to 60 prednisolone base) per day, and 1 mL to 12 mL (5 to 60 mg prednisolone base) per day, respectively, depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity, lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time, there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL), Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (15 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL), Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (20 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) and Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (25 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) should be discontinued and the patient placed on other appropriate therapy.\n \n  IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.Â  After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL), Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (15 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL), Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (20 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) and Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (25 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. \n  \n                       In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day or 4 to 8 mg dexamethasone every other day for one month have been shown to be effective. \n  \n                       In pediatric patients, the initial dose of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (10 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL), Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (15 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL), Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (20 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) and Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate (25 mg Prednisolone per 5 mL) may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day). The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day. \n  \n                       The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and longâ€‘acting bronchodilators is 1-2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or \"burst\" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (13.4 mg Prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           Cortisone, 50\n                           Triamcinolone, 8\n                        \n                        \n                           Hydrocortisone, 40\n                           Paramethasone, 4\n                        \n                        \n                           Prednisolone, 10\n                           Betamethasone, 1.5\n                        \n                        \n                           Prednisone, 10\n                           Dexamethasone, 1.5\n                        \n                        \n                           Methylprednisolone, 8\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (20.2 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           Cortisone, 75\n                           Triamcinolone, 12\n                        \n                        \n                           Hydrocortisone, 60\n                           Paramethasone, 6\n                        \n                        \n                           Prednisolone, 15\n                           Betamethasone, 2.25\n                        \n                        \n                           Prednisone, 15\n                           Dexamethasone, 2.25\n                        \n                        \n                           Methylprednisolone, 12\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (20 mg Prednisolone base per 5 mL) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           Cortisone, 100\n                           Triamcinolone, 16\n                        \n                        \n                           Hydrocortisone, 80\n                           Paramethasone, 8\n                        \n                        \n                           Prednisolone, 20\n                           Betamethasone, 3\n                        \n                        \n                           Prednisone, 20\n                           Dexamethasone, 3\n                        \n                        \n                           Methylprednisolone, 16\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     For the purpose of comparison, 5 mL of Prednisolone Sodium Phosphate Oral Solution (33.6 mg prednisolone sodium phosphate) is equivalent to the following milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           Cortisone, 125\n                           Triamcinolone, 20\n                        \n                        \n                           Hydrocortisone, 100\n                           Paramethasone, 10\n                        \n                        \n                           Prednisolone, 25\n                           Betamethasone, 3.75\n                        \n                        \n                           Prednisone, 25\n                           Dexamethasone, 3.75\n                        \n                        \n                           Methylprednisolone, 20\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds.
