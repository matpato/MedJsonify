A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, especially when half a teaspoon is to be measured. It is strongly recommended that an accurate measuring device be used. A pharmacist can provide an appropriate device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose.\n\n \n                  Promethazine HCl Oral Solution is contraindicated for children under 2 years of age (see\n \n  \n                        WARNINGS – Boxed Warning\n                     and \n \n  \n                        Use in Pediatric Patients\n                     ).\n\n \n                  \n                     Allergy\n                  \n                  The average oral dose is 25 mg taken before retiring; however, 12.5 mg may be taken before meals and on retiring, if necessary. Single 25 mg doses at bedtime or 6.25 to 12.5 mg taken three times daily will usually suffice.\n                  After initiation of treatment in children or adults, dosage should be adjusted to the smallest amount adequate to relieve symptoms.\n                  The administration of promethazine HCl in 25 mg doses will control minor transfusion reactions of an allergic nature.\n                  \n                     Motion Sickness\n                  \n                  The average adult dose is 25 mg taken twice daily. The initial dose should be taken one-half to one hour before anticipated travel and be repeated 8 to 12 hours later, if necessary. On succeeding days of travel, it is recommended that 25 mg be taken on arising and again before the evening meal. For children, 12.5 to 25 mg, twice daily, may be administered.\n                  \n                     Nausea and Vomiting\n                  \n                  Antiemetics should not be used in vomiting of unknown etiology in children and adolescents (see\n \n  \n                        WARNINGS- Use in Pediatric Patients\n                     ).\n\n \n                  The average effective dose of Promethazine HCl Oral Solution for the active therapy of nausea and vomiting in children or adults is 25 mg. When oral medication cannot be tolerated, the dose should be given parenterally (cf. Promethazine Hydrochloride Injection) or by rectal suppository. 12.5 to 25 mg doses may be repeated, as necessary, at 4 to 6 hour intervals.\n                  For nausea and vomiting in children, the usual dose is 0.5 mg per pound of body weight, and the dose should be adjusted to the age and weight of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated.\n                  For prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting, as during surgery and the postoperative period, the average dose is 25 mg repeated at 4 to 6 hour intervals, as necessary.\n                  \n                     Sedation\n                  \n                  This product relieves apprehension and induces a quiet sleep from which the patient can be easily aroused. Administration of 12.5 to 25 mg Promethazine HCl Oral Solution by the oral route at bedtime will provide sedation in children.

Postoperative sedation and adjunctive use with analgesics may be obtained by the administration of 12.5 to 25 mg in children and 25 to 50 mg doses in adults.\n                  Promethazine HCl Oral Solution is contraindicated for children under 2 years of age.",
