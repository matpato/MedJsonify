An FDA-authorized test for the measurement of concizumab-mtci concentration in plasma is not currently available. o Once the concizumab-mtci concentration result is available, individualize the maintenance dose of Alhemo no later than 8 weeks after initiation of treatment, based on the following concizumab‑mtci plasma concentrations: ▪ Less than 200 ng/mL: adjust to a once-daily dose of 0.25 mg/kg (2.1) ▪ 200 to 4,000 ng/mL: continue once-daily dose of 0.2 mg/kg ( 2.1 ) ▪ Greater than 4,000 ng/mL: adjust to a once-daily dose of 0.15 mg/kg ( 2.1 ) • See full Prescribing Information for important preparation and administration instructions ( 2.3 , 2.4 ).",
