In patients who meet criteria for a diagnosis of Stage 2 type 1 diabetes, ensure the clinical history of the patient does not suggest type 2 diabetes ( 2.1 ). Prior to initiating TZIELD, obtain a complete blood count and liver enzyme tests. Use of TZIELD is not recommended in patients with certain laboratory abnormalities ( 2.2 ). Must dilute TZIELD in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. See full prescribing information for detailed preparation and administration instructions ( 2.3 , 2.4 , 2.5 ). Premedicate with: (1) a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or acetaminophen, (2) an antihistamine, and/or (3) an antiemetic before each TZIELD dose for at least the first 5 days of the 14-day treatment course ( 2.3 ).
