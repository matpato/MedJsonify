( 1.1 ) Carcinoid Tumors: For the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with the disease. ( 1.2 ) Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide Tumors (VIPomas): For the treatment of profuse watery diarrhea associated with VIP-secreting tumors. ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use Improvement in clinical signs and symptoms, or reduction in tumor size or rate of growth, were not shown in clinical trials performed with octreotide acetate injection; these trials were not optimally designed to detect such effects.

At room temperature (20°C to 30°C or 70°F to 86°F), octreotide acetate injection is stable for 14 days if protected from light. The solution can be allowed to come to room temperature prior to administration. Do not warm artificially. After initial use, the 5 mL multiple dose vials should be discarded within 14 days. Dispose unused product or waste properly. Octreotide acetate injection is stable in sterile isotonic saline solutions or sterile solutions of dextrose 5% in water for 24 hours.",
