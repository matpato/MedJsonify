    "indications_original": "Hypertension\n                       Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension.\n\n \n                  \n                       Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate tablets, USP and thiazides are approximately additive.\n \n                  \n                     \n                     Heart Failure\n                       Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients enalapril maleate tablets, USP improve symptoms, increase survival, and decrease the frequency of hospitalization (see\n \n  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trialsfor details and limitations of survival trials).\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                     Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction\n                       In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets, USP decrease the rate of development of overt heart failure and decrease the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see \n \n  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trialsfor details and limitations of survival trials).\n\n \n                  \n                       In using enalapril maleate tablets, USP consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate tablets, USP do not have a similar risk (see\n \n  WARNINGS, Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis).\n\n \n                  \n                       In considering use of enalapril maleate tablets, USP, it should be noted that in controlled clinical trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks (see\n \n  WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema).",
    "contraindications_original": "Hypertension\n                       In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally may occur following the initial dose of enalapril maleate. The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before beginning therapy with enalapril maleate to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (see\n \n  WARNINGS, Hypotension). If the patients blood pressure is not controlled with enalapril maleate alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed. \n\n \n                  If the diuretic cannot be discontinued an initial dose of 2.5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see\n \n  WARNINGS, Hypotensionand\n \n  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).\n\n \n                  \n                       The recommended initial dose in patients not on diuretics is 5 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 10 to 40 mg per day administered in a single dose or two divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, an increase in dosage or twice daily administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not controlled with enalapril maleate alone, a diuretic may be added. Concomitant administration of enalapril maleate with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see\n \n  PRECAUTIONS).\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                     Dosage Adjustment in Hypertensive Patients with Renal Impairment \n                  \n                  The usual dose of enalapril is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance more than 30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg/dL).

The recommended dosing range is 2.5 to 20 mg given twice a day. Doses should be titrated upward, as tolerated, over a period of a few days or weeks. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials was 40 mg in divided doses.\n                  \n                       After the initial dose of enalapril maleate, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see\n \n  WARNINGS and\n \n  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension.

The dose may be increased to 2.5 mg b.i.d., then 5 mg b.i.d. and higher as needed, usually at intervals of four days or more if at the time of dosage adjustment there is not excessive hypotension or significant deterioration of renal function.
