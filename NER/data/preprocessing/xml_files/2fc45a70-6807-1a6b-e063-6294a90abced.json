On Day 2, administer up to 16 mg/4 mg of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film as a single dose. ( 2.3 ) For patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products, induction onto sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended on Days 1 and 2 of treatment. ( 2.3 ) For maintenance treatment, the target dosage of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is usually 16 mg/4 mg as a single daily dose. ( 2.4 ) Sublingual Administration: Place one film under the tongue, close to the base on the left or right side, and allow to completely dissolve. Buccal Administration: Place one film on the inside of the left or right cheek and allow to completely dissolve. ( 2.5 ) Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film must be administered whole.
