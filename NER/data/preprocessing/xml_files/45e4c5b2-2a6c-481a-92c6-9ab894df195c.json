    "indications_original": "Nafcillin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci which have demonstrated susceptibility to the drug. Cultures and susceptibility tests should be performed initially to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to the drug (see \n                        CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY - Susceptibility Test Methods\n                     ).\n                  \n                  Nafcillin should not be used in infections caused by organisms susceptible to penicillin G.

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
