    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol is supplied as a pressurized aluminum canister with a blue plastic actuator with a dose indicator and green dust cap each in boxes of one. Each canister contains 8.5 g of the formulation and provides 200 actuations (NDC 76420-350-90 relabeled from NDC 68180-963-01). Each actuation delivers 120 mcg of albuterol sulfate from the canister valve and 108 mcg of albuterol sulfate from the actuator mouthpiece (equivalent to 90 mcg of albuterol base).\n                  SHAKE WELL BEFORE USE. Store between 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F). [See USP Controlled Room Temperature.] Contents under pressure. Do not puncture or incinerate. Protect from freezing temperatures and prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. Exposure to temperatures above 120\n \n  oF may cause bursting. For best results, canister should be at room temperature before use. Avoid spraying in eyes. Keep out of reach of children.\n\n \n                  See FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (17.9) for priming and cleaning instructions.\n                  The blue actuator supplied with albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol should not be used with the canister from any other inhalation aerosol products. The albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol canister should not be used with the actuator from any other inhalation aerosol products.\n                  Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol has a dose indicator attached to the actuator. Patients should never try to alter the numbers for the dose indicator or tamper with the dose indicator button mechanism. Discard the albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol when the indicator displays 0 or after the expiration date on the product, whichever comes first. The labeled amount of medication in each actuation cannot be assured after the indicator displays 0, even though the canister is not completely empty and will continue to operate. Never immerse the canister into water to determine how full the canister is (\"float test\").\n                  Albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol does not contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as the propellant.",

Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, and rash have been reported after the use of albuterol sulfate\n \n  [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (\n  \n   5.6)]\n \n  ."
