    "indications_original": "Ampicillin for injection is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the following conditions:\n                  \n                     Respiratory Tract Infectionscaused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and nonpenicillinase-producing), H. influenzae, and Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.\n\n \n                  \n                     Bacterial Meningitiscaused by E. coli, Group B streptococci, and other Gram-negative bacteria (\n \n  Listeria monocytogenes, N. meningitidis). The addition of an aminoglycoside with ampicillin may increase its effectiveness against Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n \n                  \n                     Septicemia and Endocarditiscaused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms including S\n \n  treptococcus spp., penicillin G-susceptible staphylococci,and\n \n  enterococci. Gram-negative sepsis caused by\n \n  E. coli,\n \n  Proteus mirabilisand\n \n  Salmonella spp.responds to ampicillin. Endocarditis due to enterococcal strains usually respond to intravenous therapy.

Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing. It is advisable to reserve the parenteral form of this drug for moderately severe and severe infections and for patients who are unable to take the oral forms. A change to oral ampicillin may be made as soon as appropriate.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin for injection and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin for injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n                  Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.",
