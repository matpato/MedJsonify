    "contraindications_original": "Oral administration is preferred. Although most patients with malabsorption cannot absorb food folates, they are able to absorb folic acid, USP given orally. Parenteral administration is not advocated but may be necessary in some individuals (e.g., patients receiving parenteral or enteral alimentation). Doses greater than 0.1 mg should not be used unless ane mia due to vitamin B\n \n  12deficiency has been ruled out or is being adequately treated with a cobalamin.

Resistant cases may require larger doses. \n  \n                       When clinical symptoms have subsided and the blood picture has become normal, a daily maintenance level should be used, i.e., 0.1 mg for infants and up to 0.3 mg for children under 4 years of age, 0.4 mg for adults and children 4 or more years of age, and 0.8 mg for pregnant and lactating women, but never less than 0.1 mg/day. Patients should be kept under close supervision and adjustment of the maintenance level made if relapse appears imminent.\n \n                  \n                  \n                  In the presence of alcoholism, hemolytic anemia, anticonvulsant therapy, or chronic infection, the maintenance level may need to be increased.",
