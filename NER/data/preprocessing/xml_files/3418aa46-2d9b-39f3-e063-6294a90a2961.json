    "indications_original": "Dobutamine in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures. Experience with intravenous dobutamine in controlled trials does not extend beyond 48 hours of repeated boluses and/or continuous infusions.\n                  Whether given orally, continuously intravenously, or intermittently intravenously, neither dobutamine nor any other cyclic-AMP-dependent inotrope has been shown in controlled trials to be safe or effective in the long-term treatment of congestive heart failure. In controlled trials of chronic oral therapy with various such agents, symptoms were not consistently alleviated, and the cyclic-AMP-dependent inotropes were consistently associated with increased risks of hospitalization and death. Patients with NYHA Class IV symptoms appeared to be at particular risk.",
    "contraindications_original": "Recommended Dosage\n                  Dobutamine in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is administered intravenously through a suitable intravenous catheter or needle. A calibrated electronic infusion device is recommended for controlling the rate of flow in mL/hour or drops/minute. Infusion of dobutamine should be started at a low rate (0.5 to 1.0 µg/kg/min) and titrated at intervals of a few minutes, guided by the patient's response, including systemic blood pressure, urine flow, frequency of ectopic activity, heart rate, and (whenever possible) measurements of cardiac output, central venous pressure, and/or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In reported trials, the optimal infusion rates have varied from patient to patient, usually 2 to 20 µg/kg/min but sometimes slightly outside of this range. On rare occasions, infusion rates up to 40 µg/kg/min have been required to obtain the desired effect.\n                  Rates of infusion in mL/hour for dobutamine hydrochloride concentrations of 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 mg/L may be calculated using the following formula:\n                  \n                  \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                  This container system may be inappropriate for the dosage requirements of pediatric patients under 30 kg.\n                  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.\n                  Dobutamine in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP solutions may exhibit a pink color that, if present, will increase with time. This color change is due to slight oxidation of the drug, but there is no significant loss of potency.\n                  Solutions containing dextrose should not be administered through the same administration set as blood, as this may result in pseudoagglutination or hemolysis.\n                  Do not add supplementary medications to Dobutamine in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. Do not administer Dobutamine in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP simultaneously with solutions containing sodium bicarbonate or strong alkaline solutions.\n                  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE\n                  To Open\n                  Tear outer wrap at notch and remove solution container. Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety. The opacity will diminish gradually.\n                  Preparation for Administration\n                  (Use aseptic technique)\n                  1.\n  \nClose flow control clamp of administration set.\n  \n2.\n  \nRemove cover from outlet port at bottom of container.\n  \n3.\n  \nInsert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the set is firmly seated.\n  \nNOTE: See full directions on administration set carton.\n  \n4.\n  \nSuspend container from hanger.\n  \n5.\n  \nSqueeze and release drip chamber to establish proper fluid level in chamber.\n  \n6.\n  \nOpen flow control clamp and clear air from set. Close clamp.\n  \n7.\n  \nAttach set to venipuncture device. If device is not indwelling, prime and make venipuncture.\n  \n8.\n  \nRegulate rate of administration with flow control clamp.\n \n                  WARNING: Do not use flexible container in series connections.",
