    "indications_original": "Ziprasidone capsules are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar manic or mixed episodes, and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. When deciding among the alternative treatments available for the condition needing treatment, the prescriber should consider the finding of ziprasidone’s greater capacity to prolong the QT/QTc interval compared to several other antipsychotic drugs [see \n \n  Warnings and Precautions (\n  \n   5.3)\n \n  ]. Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated in some other drugs with the ability to cause torsade de pointes-type arrhythmia, a potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs should be tried first. Whether ziprasidone will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known [see\n \n  Warnings and Precautions (\n  \n   5.3)\n \n  ]\n\n \n                  \n                     Schizophrenia\n                  \n                  \n                     Ziprasidone capsules are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults [see\n  \n   Clinical Studies (\n   \n    14.1)\n  \n   ].\n \n  \n                  \n                  \n                     Bipolar I Disorder (Acute Mixed or Manic Episodes and Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate)\n                  \n                  \n                     Ziprasidone capsules are indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder [see\n  \n   Clinical Studies (\n   \n    14.2)].\n  \n   \n                     \n                     Ziprasidone capsules are indicated as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults [see\n  \n   Clinical Studies (\n   \n    14.2)\n  \n   ].",

The lowest effective dose should be used. ( 2.2 ) Acute treatment of manic/mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder: Initiate at 40 mg twice daily. Increase to 60 mg or 80 mg twice daily on day 2 of treatment. Subsequent dose adjustments should be based on tolerability and efficacy within the range of 40 to 80 mg twice daily.
