When substituting for oral nicardipine therapy, use the intravenous infusion rate as follows ( 2.3 ): Oral Nicardipine Dose Equivalent Intravenous Infusion Rate 20 mg every 8 hours 0.5 mg/hr 30 mg every 8 hours 1.2 mg/hr 40 mg every 8 hours 2.2 mg/hr In a drug-free patient, initiate therapy at 5 mg/hr. Increase the infusion rate by 2.5 mg/hr to a maximum of 15 mg/hr until desired blood pressure reduction is achieved. For a gradual blood pressure reduction the rate can be increased every 15 minutes, for a rapid reduction, every 5 minutes ( 2.4 ). If hypotension or tachycardia ensues, discontinue the infusion. After stabilized, patient can be restarted at low doses such as 3 mg/hr to 5 mg/hr ( 2.5 ).",
