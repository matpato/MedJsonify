    "indications_original": "Preservative-free timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP in the unit dose vial is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.\n                  Preservative-free timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP in the unit dose vial may be used when a patient is sensitive to the preservative in timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP, benzalkonium chloride, or when use of a preservative-free topical medication is advisable.",
    "contraindications_original": "Preservative-free timolol maleate ophthalmic solution USP in the unit dose vial is a sterile solution that does not contain a preservative. The solution from one individual unit is to be used immediately after opening for administration to one or both eyes. Since sterility cannot be guaranteed after the individual unit is opened, the remaining contents should be discarded immediately after administration.\n                  Preservative-free timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in the unit dose vial is available in concentrations of 0.25% and 0.5%. The usual starting dose is one drop of 0.25% preservative-free timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in the unit dose vial in the affected eye(s) administered twice a day. Apply enough gentle pressure on the individual vial to obtain a single drop of solution. If the clinical response is not adequate, the dosage may be changed to one drop of 0.5% solution in the affected eye(s) administered twice a day.\n                  Since in some patients the pressure-lowering response to preservative-free timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in the unit dose vial may require a few weeks to stabilize, evaluation should include a determination of intraocular pressure after approximately 4 weeks of treatment with preservative-free timolol maleate ophthalmic solution in the unit dose vial.\n                  If the intraocular pressure is maintained at satisfactory levels, the dosage schedule may be changed to one drop once a day in the affected eye(s). Because of diurnal variations in intraocular pressure, satisfactory response to the once-a-day dose is best determined by measuring the intraocular pressure at different times during the day.\n                  Dosages above one drop of 0.5% timolol maleate ophthalmic solution twice a day generally have not been shown to produce further reduction in intraocular pressure. If the patient’s intraocular pressure is still not at a satisfactory level on this regimen, concomitant therapy with other agent(s) for lowering intraocular pressure can be instituted taking into consideration that the preparation(s) used concomitantly may contain one or more preservatives.\n                  The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended. (See PRECAUTIONS, \n                        Drug Interactions, Beta-adrenergic blocking agents\n                     .)",
