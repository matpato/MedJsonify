If gastrointestinal complaints occur, administer ibuprofen tablets with meals or milk.\n                  \n                  \n                     Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, including flare-ups of chronic disease:\n                  \n                  \n                     Suggested Dosage: 1200 mg to 3200 mg daily (300 mg four times a day, 400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg three times a day or four times a day). Individual patients may show a better response to 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlled clinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a better mean response in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with 3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefits to offset potential increased risk. \n      \n\n \n                  \n                  The dose should be tailored to each patient and may be lowered or raised depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiating drug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.\n                  \n                  In general, patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higher doses of ibuprofen tablets than do patients with osteoarthritis.\n                  \n                  The smallest dose of ibuprofen tablets that yields acceptable control should be employed. A linear blood level dose-response relationship exists with single doses up to 800 mg (see \n                  \n                     CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for effects of food on rate of absorption).\n      \n\n \n                  \n                  The availability of three tablet strengths facilitates dosage adjustment. \n                  \n                  \n                     In \n       \n \n  chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with ibuprofen tablets is some times seen in a few days to a week but most often is observed by two weeks.
