    "indications_original": "ESTRING is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause.",
    "contraindications_original": "One ESTRING (estradiol vaginal system) is to be inserted as deeply as possible into the upper one-third of the vaginal vault. The ring is to remain in place continuously for three months, after which it is to be removed and, if appropriate, replaced by a new ring. The need to continue treatment should be assessed at 3 or 6 month intervals.\n                  Should the ring be removed or fall out at any time during the 90-day treatment period, the ring should be rinsed in lukewarm water and re-inserted by the patient, or, if necessary, by a physician or nurse.\n                  Retention of the ring for greater than 90 days does not represent overdosage but will result in progressively greater underdosage with the attendant risk of loss of efficacy and increasing risk of vaginal infections and/or erosions.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "Each ESTRING (estradiol vaginal system) contains 2 mg estradiol to deliver 7.5 mcg of estradiol per day over 90 days, and is individually packaged in a heat-sealed rectangular pouch consisting of three layers, from outside to inside: polyester, aluminum foil, and low-density polyethylene, respectively. The pouch is provided with a tear-off notch on one side.\n                  NDC 0013-1042-01 ESTRING (estradiol vaginal system) delivers 7.5 mcg per day – one vaginal system (contains 2 mg estradiol to deliver 7.5 mcg of estradiol per day over 90 days).",
