( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Adjunctive      therapy: Target therapeutic dosage range is 200 to 600 mg daily and is      dependent on concomitant AEDs. ( 2.2 ) Conversion to      monotherapy: Target therapeutic dosage range is 250 to 300 mg daily. ( 2.3 ) Conversion      from immediate-release lamotrigine to lamotrigine extended-release: The      initial dose of lamotrigine extended-release should match the total daily      dose of the immediate-release lamotrigine. Patients should be closely      monitored for seizure control after conversion.
