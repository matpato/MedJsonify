  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phytonadione tablets are indicated for the treatment of adults with the following coagulation disorders which are due to faulty formation of factors II, VII, IX and X when caused by vitamin K deficiency or interference with vitamin K activity. • Anticoagulant-induced hypoprothrombinemia caused by coumarin or indanedione derivatives. • Hypoprothrombinemia secondary to antibacterial therapy. • Hypoprothrombinemia secondary to factors limiting absorpsion or synthesis of vitamin K, e.g. , obstructive jaundice, biliary fistula, sprue, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, intestinal resection, cystic fibrosis of the pancrease, and regional enteritis. • Other drug-induced hypoprothrombinemia where it is definitely shown that the result is due to interference with vitamin K metabolism, e.g. , salicylates. Phytonadione is a vitamin K replacement indicated for the treatment of adults with the following coagulation disorders which are due to faulty formation of factors II, VII, IX and X when caused by vitamin K deficiency or interference with vitamin K activity: • Anticoagulant-induced prothrombin deficiency caused by coumarin or indanedione derivatives. ( 1 ) • Hypoprothrombinemia secondary to antibacterial therapy.

  "warningsAndPrecautions": null,
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of parenteral phytonadione were identified in clinical studies or post-marketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions and deaths, have been reported following parenteral administration. The majority of these reported events occurred following intravenous administration. Transient “flushing sensations” and “peculiar” sensations of taste have been observed with parenteral phytonadione, as well as instances of dizziness, rapid and weak pulse, profuse sweating, brief hypotension, dyspnea, and cyanosis. Hyperbilirubinemia has been observed in the newborn following administration of parenteral phytonadione. This has occurred primarily with doses above those recommended. Most common adverse reactions are transient “flushing sensations” , “peculiar” sensations of taste and instances of dizziness, rapid and weak pulse, profuse sweating, brief hypotension, dyspnea, and cyanosis.
