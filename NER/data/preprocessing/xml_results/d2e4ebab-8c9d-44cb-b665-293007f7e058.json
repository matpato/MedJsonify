    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Systemic fungal infections.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: Reduce resistance Exacerbate existing infections Increase the risk if disseminated infections Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider prednisolone oral solution withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Do not administer prednisolone oral solution by an intraarticular, intrabursal, intratendinous, or intralesional route in the presence of acute local infection. Tuberculosis If prednisolone oral solution is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged prednisolone oral solution therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution. In corticosteroids-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles: If a prednisolone oral solution-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If a prednisolone oral solution-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroids-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g. prolonged) treatment with prednisolone oral solution. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physician with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid prednisolone oral solution use in the presence of such infections unless prednisolone oral solution is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic prednisolone oral solution therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, prednisolone oral solution withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating prednisolone oral solution in patients who spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Stronyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including prednisolone oral solution, in patients with cerebral malaria. Kaposi’s Sarcoma Kaposi’s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroids therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi’s sarcoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy, patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response. Use in pregnancy: Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of childbearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism.PRECAUTIONS General Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infections; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Information for Patients Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.",
