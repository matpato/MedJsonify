Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in kidney interstitial capillary cell globotriaosylceramide (KIC GL-3) substrate [see .

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amicus Therapeutics at 1-877-4AMICUS or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, 139 patients with Fabry disease (79 females, 60 males, 92% Caucasian, ages 16 to 72 years), who were naïve to GALAFOLD or previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy, were exposed to at least one dose of GALAFOLD. Of the 139 patients, 127 patients were exposed to GALAFOLD 123 mg every other day for 6 months and 123 patients were exposed for greater than one year. The clinical trials included one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration followed by a 6-month open-label treatment phase (Study 1) [see . A second trial was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical trial of 18 months duration in patients with Fabry disease receiving enzyme replacement therapy who were randomized to either switch to GALAFOLD or continue enzyme replacement therapy (Study 2; NCT01218659). In addition, there were two open-label, long-term extension trials. Clinical Studies (14) ] The most common adverse reactions reported with GALAFOLD (≥ 10%) during the 6-month placebo-controlled, double-blind phase of Study 1 were headache, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, nausea, and pyrexia. Table 1 shows adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with GALAFOLD during the 6-month placebo-controlled, double-blind phase of Study 1. Table 1:\tAdverse Reactions* in Patients with Fabry Disease (Study 1) * Adverse reactions were those that occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with GALAFOLD. ** Included urinary tract infection, cystitis, and kidney infection Adverse Reaction GALAFOLD % (N = 34) Placebo % (N = 33) Headache 35% 21% Nasopharyngitis 18% 6% Urinary tract infection** 15% 0 Nausea 12% 6% Pyrexia 12% 3% Abdominal pain 9% 3% Back pain 9% 0 Cough 9% 0 Diarrhea 9% 3% Epistaxis 9% 3% Adverse reactions that occurred in > 5% of patients who received GALAFOLD in the 6-month open-label treatment phase of Study 1, in Study 2, and in the long-term extension trials (N = 115, mean duration of treatment 2.7 years) included those in Table 1 with the addition of vomiting. 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of GALAFOLD. Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
