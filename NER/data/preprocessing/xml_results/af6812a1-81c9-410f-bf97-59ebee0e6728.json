  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 ) ] Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules are a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age ( 1 ) .",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other components of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions, have been reported in patients treated with methylphenidate [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 ) ] • Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) , or within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with an MAOI, because of the risk of hypertensive crises [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 ) ] • Known hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or product components ( 4 ) . • Concurrent treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) or use of an MAOI within the preceding 14 days ( 4 ) .",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease: Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac rhythm arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease ( 5.2 ) . • Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate : Monitor blood pressure and pulse ( 5.3 ) . • Psychiatric Adverse Reactions : Prior to initiating methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. If new psychotic or manic symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules ( 5.4 ) . • Priapism : If abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections occur, patients should seek immediate medical attention ( 5.5 ) . • Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s Phenomenon : Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Further clinical evaluation ( e.g. , rheumatology referral ) may be appropriate for patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy ( 5.6 ) . • Long-Term Suppression of Growth i n Pediatric Patients: Closely monitor growth ( height and weight ) in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted ( 5.7 ) . • Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma ( e.g. , patients with significant hyperopia ) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist ( 5.8 ) . • Increased Intraocular Pressure ( IOP ) and Glaucoma : Prescribe methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules to patients with open-angle glaucoma or abnormally increased IOP only if the benefit of treatment is considered to outweigh the risk. Closely monitor patients with a history of abnormally increased IOP or open angle glaucoma ( 5.9 ) . • Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette’s Syndrome : Before initiating methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Regularly monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate ( 5.10 ) . 5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules have a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( . Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, can result in overdose and death 9.2 ) ] [see Overdosage ( , and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. 10 ) ] Before prescribing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules to anyone else. Throughout treatment with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, reassess each patient’s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. 5.2 Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who are treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. 5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure ( mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg ) and heart rate ( mean increase approximately 3 to 6 beats per minute ) . Some patients may have larger increases. Monitor all patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for hypertension and tachycardia. 5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Preexisting Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed mood episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode ( e.g. , comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression ) . New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms ( e.g. , hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania ) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. 5.5 Priapism Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate use in both adult and pediatric male patients. Although priapism was not reported with methylphenidate initiation, it developed after some time on methylphenidate, often subsequent to an increase in dosage. Priapism also occurred during methylphenidate withdrawal ( drug holidays or during discontinuation ) . Patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention. 5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud’s Phenomenon CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules , used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon were observed in post-marketing reports and at the therapeutic dosage of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or the CNS stimulant. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Further clinical evaluation ( e.g. , rheumatology referral ) may be appropriate for patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. 5.7 Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated patients over 36 months ( to the ages of 10 to13 years ) , suggests that pediatric patients who received methylphenidate for 7 days per week throughout the year had a temporary slowing in growth rate ( on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years ) , without evidence of growth rebound during this development period. Closely monitor growth ( weight and height ) in pediatric patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. 5.8 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma There have been reports of angle closure glaucoma associated with methylphenidate treatment. Although the mechanism is not clear, patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma ( e.g. , patients with significant hyperopia ) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. 5.9 Increased Intraocular Pressure and Glaucoma There have been reports of an elevation of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) associated with methylphenidate treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( Prescribe methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules to patients with open-angle glaucoma or abnormally increased IOP only if the benefit of treatment is considered to outweigh the risk. Closely monitor patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules who have a history of abnormally increased IOP or open angle glaucoma. 6.2 ) ] . 5.10 Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette’s Syndrome CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette’s syndrome has also been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 ) ] Before initiating methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Regularly monitor patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette’s syndrome and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.",

The clinical program for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules consisted of 6 studies: 2 controlled clinical studies conducted in children with ADHD aged 6 to 12 years and 4 clinical pharmacology studies conducted in healthy adult volunteers. These studies included a total of 256 subjects; 195 children with ADHD and 61 healthy adult volunteers. The subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in doses of 10 to 40 mg per day. Safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules was assessed by evaluating frequency and nature of adverse events, routine laboratory tests, vital signs, and body weight. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules in children with ADHD aged 6 to 12 years. All subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for up to 4 weeks, and had their dose optimally adjusted, prior to entering the double-blind phase of the trial. In the 2-week double-blind treatment phase of this study, patients received either placebo or methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules at their individually-titrated dose ( range, 10 mg to 40 mg ) . Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 5% during the initial 4-week single-blind methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules titration period of this study were headache, insomnia, upper abdominal pain, appetite decreased, and anorexia. Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 2% among methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules-treated subjects, during the 2-week double-blind phase of the clinical study, are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Adverse Reactions in Greater Than 2% Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules-Treated Subjects in the 2-Week Double-Blind Phase Preferred Term Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules N = 65 N ( % ) Placebo N = 71 N ( % ) Anorexia 2 ( 3.1 ) 0 ( 0.0 ) Insomnia 2 ( 3.1 ) 0 ( 0.0 ) Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment In the 2-week double-blind treatment phase of a placebo-controlled parallel-group study in children with ADHD, one methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules-treated subject ( 1/65, 1.5% ) discontinued due to an adverse event ( depressed mood ) . In the single-blind titration period of this study, subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules for up to 4 weeks. During this period a total of 6 subjects ( 6/161, 3.7% ) discontinued due to adverse events. The adverse events leading to discontinuation were anger ( 2 patients ) , hypomania, anxiety, depressed mood, fatigue, migraine, and lethargy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during the post approval use of methylphenidate products. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
