    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tabletsÂ are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular (CV)Â events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programâ€™s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Limitations of Use This fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension. Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is a combination of olmesartan medoxomil, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Limitations of Use Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not indicated for initial therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Because of the hydrochlorothiazide component, Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are contraindicated in patients with anuria, hypersensitivity to any component, or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration. ( 5.2 ). Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients Increased angina or myocardial infarction with calcium channel blockers may occur upon dosage initiation or increase ( 5.3 ). Observe for signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance ( 5.6 ). Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus ( 5.8 ). Acute angle-closure glaucoma ( 5.9 ). Sprue-like enteropathy has been reported. Consider discontinuation of Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tabletsÂ in cases where no other etiology is found ( 5.10 ) 5.1\nFetal Toxicity Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.Â  Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible olmesartan medoxomil . [see Use in specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. Adverse reactions include fetal or neonatal jaundice and thrombocytopenia Hydrochlorothiazide. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.2\nHypotension in Volume-or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume-and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics) symptomatic hypotension may be anticipated after initiation of treatment with olmesartan medoxomil.  Initiate treatment with Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets under close medical supervision. If hypotension does occur, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. Olmesartan medoxomil. Symptomatic hypotension is possible, particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Because of the gradual onset of action, acute hypotension is unlikely. Amlodipine. 5.3\nIncreased Angina and/or Myocardial Infarction Patients, particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease, may develop increased frequency, duration, or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction upon starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase. The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated. Amlodipine. 5.4\nImpaired Renal Function Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. Impaired renal function was reported in 2.1% of subjects receiving olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets compared to 0.2% to 1.3% of subjects receiving dual combination therapy of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine, olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Changes in renal function occur in some individuals treated with olmesartan medoxomil as a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In patients whose renal function may depend upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar effects may occur in patients treated with Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to the olmesartan medoxomil component Olmesartan medoxomil. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been reported. There has been no long-term use of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but similar effects would be expected with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets because of the olmesartan medoxomil component. Thiazides may precipitate azotemia in patients with renal disease. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. Hydrochlorothiazide. 5.5\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment Since amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver and the plasma elimination half-life (t Amlodipine. 1/2 ) is 56 hours in patients with severely impaired hepatic function, titrate slowly when administering to patients with severe hepatic impairment. 5.6\nElectrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets also contains olmesartan, a drug that affects the RAS. Drugs that inhibit the RAS can also cause hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels. 5.7\nPostsympathectomy Patients The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient. 5.8\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Hydrochlorothiazide. 5.9\nAcute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. 5.10\nSprue-like Enteropathy Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan,Â  exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in cases where no other etiology is identified. Olmesartan medoxomil .",

Safety data from this study were obtained in 574 patients with hypertension who received olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets for 8 weeks. The frequency of adverse reactions was similar between men and women, patients <65 years of age and patients â‰¥65 years of age, patients with and without diabetes, and Black and non-Black patients. Discontinuations because of adverse events occurred in 4% of patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 40/10/25 mg compared to 1% of patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 40/10 mg, 2% of patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide 40/25 mg, and 2% of patients treated with amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide 10/25 mg. The most common reason for discontinuation with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets was dizziness (1%). Dizziness was one of the most frequently reported adverse reactions with incidence of 1.4% to 3.6% in subjects continuing on dual combination therapy compared to 5.8% to 8.9% in subjects who switched to olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The other most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of subjects are presented in the table below: Table 1 Adverse Reaction OM40/ AML10/ HCTZ25 mg (N = 574) n (%) OM40/ AML10 mg (N = 596) n (%) OM40/ HCTZ25 mg (N = 580) n (%) AML10/ HCTZ25 mg (N = 552) n (%) Edema peripheral 44 (7.7) 42 (7.0) 6 (1.0) 46 (8.3) Headache 37 (6.4) 42 (7.0) 38 (6.6) 33 (6.0) Fatigue 24 (4.2) 34 (5.7) 31 (5.3) 36 (6.5) Nasopharyngitis 20 (3.5) 11 (1.8) 20 (3.4) 16 (2.9) Muscle spasms 18 (3.1) 12 (2.0) 14 (2.4) 13 (2.4) Nausea 17 (3.0) 12 (2.0) 22 (3.8) 12 (2.2) Upper respiratory tract infection 16 (2.8) 26 (4.4) 18 (3.1) 14 (2.5) Diarrhea 15 (2.6) 14 (2.3) 12 (2.1) 9 (1.6) Urinary tract infection 14 (2.4) 8 (1.3) 6 (1.0) 7 (1.3) Joint swelling 12 (2.1) 17 (2.9) 2 (0.3) 16 (2.9) Syncope was reported by 1% of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets subjects compared to 0.5% or less for the other treatment groups. Olmesartan medoxomil Olmesartan medoxomil has been evaluated for safety in more than 3825 patients/subjects, including more than 3275 patients treated for hypertension in controlled trials. This experience included about 900 patients treated for at least 6 months and more than 525 treated for at least 1 year. Treatment with olmesartan medoxomil was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse reactions similar to that seen with placebo. Adverse reactions were generally mild, transient, and without relationship to the dose of olmesartan medoxomil. Amlodipine Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of the individual components of Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience: Olmesartan medoxomil. Body as a Whole: asthenia, angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, peripheral edema Gastrointestinal: vomiting, diarrhea, sprue-like enteropathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hyperkalemia Musculoskeletal: rhabdomyolysis Urogenital System: acute renal failure, increased blood creatinine Skin and Appendages: alopecia, pruritus, urticaria Data from one controlled trial and an epidemiologic study have suggested that high-dose olmesartan may increase cardiovascular (CV) risk in diabetic patients, but the overall data are not conclusive. The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind ROADMAP trial (Randomized Olmesartan And Diabetes MicroAlbuminuria Prevention trial, n=4447) examined the use of olmesartan, 40 mg daily, vs. placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, normoalbuminuria, and at least one additional risk factor for CV disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, delayed onset of microalbuminuria, but olmesartan had no beneficial effect on decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). There was a finding of increased CV mortality (adjudicated sudden cardiac death, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, revascularization death) in the olmesartan group compared to the placebo group (15 olmesartan vs. 3 placebo, HR 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4, 17), but the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction was lower with olmesartan (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35, 1.18). The epidemiologic study included patients 65 years and older with overall exposure of > 300,000 patient-years. In the sub-group of diabetic patients receiving high-dose olmesartan (40 mg/d) for > 6 months, there appeared to be an increased risk of death (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1, 3.8) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. In contrast, high-dose olmesartan use in non-diabetic patients appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of death (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86) compared to similar patients taking other angiotensin receptor blockers. No differences were observed between the groups receiving lower doses of olmesartan compared to other angiotensin blockers or those receiving therapy for Ë‚ 6 months. Overall, these data raise a concern of a possible increased CV risk associated with the use of high-dose olmesartan in diabetic patients. There are, however, concerns with the credibility of the finding of increased CV risk, notably the observation in the large epidemiologic study for a survival benefit in non-diabetics of a magnitude similar to the adverse finding in diabetics. The following post-marketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In post-marketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine. Hydrochlorothiazide . Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of â‰¥50,000mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year."
