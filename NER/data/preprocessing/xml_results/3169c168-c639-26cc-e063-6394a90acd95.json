    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials of a drug cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. The data described below reflect exposure to ChiRhoStim® in 531 patients from an open-label clinical trial. The population consisted of patients aged 1 to 91 years, 185 males, 346 females, 480 Caucasians, 31 Blacks, 12 American Indians, 6 Hispanics, and 2 Asians with known or suspected diseases of the exocrine pancreas including chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Most patients received a single dose of ChiRhoStim® in a dose range of 0.2 mcg/kg to 0.4 mcg/kg. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients in the trial) are listed in Table 2. TABLE 2 Adverse Reactions in at Least 2 Patients Treated with a Single-Dose of ChiRhoStim® in a Clinical Trial Adverse Reaction ChiRhoStim® Number of Patients N = 531 Nausea 9 Vomiting 3 Flushing 2 Upset stomach 2 Most common adverse reactions (≥2 patients) are nausea, vomiting, flushing, and upset stomach.
