    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE DOJOLVI is indicated as a source of calories and fatty acids for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with molecularly confirmed long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD). DOJOLVI is a medium-chain triglyceride indicated as a source of calories and fatty acids for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with molecularly confirmed long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD).",

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Feeding Tube Dysfunction : Regularly monitor the feeding tube to ensure proper functioning and integrity. ( 5.1 ) Intestinal Malabsorption in Patients with Pancreatic Insufficiency : Low or absent pancreatic enzymes may reduce absorption of DOJOLVI. Avoid administration of DOJOLVI in patients with pancreatic insufficiency. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Feeding Tube Dysfunction Feeding tube performance and functionality can degrade over time depending on usage and environmental conditions. In clinical trials, feeding tube dysfunction was reported in patients receiving triheptanoin. The contribution of DOJOLVI cannot be ruled out. Do not administer DOJOLVI in feeding tubes manufactured of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) [see .  Regularly monitor the feeding tube to ensure proper functioning and integrity. Dosage and Administration (2.4 ] 5.2 Intestinal Malabsorption in Patients with Pancreatic Insufficiency Pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze triheptanoin and release heptanoate as medium-chain fatty acids in the small intestine. Low or absent pancreatic enzymes may result in reduced absorption of heptanoate subsequently leading to insufficient supplementation of medium-chain fatty acids. Avoid administration of DOJOLVI in patients with pancreatic insufficiency.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are (≥10%): abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. at 1-888-756-8657 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety population included 79 patients with LC-FAOD exposed to DOJOLVI in two studies: one open-label 78-week study of DOJOLVI in 29 patients (Study 1) followed by an open-label extension study (Study 2). Twenty-four patients from Study 1 continued into Study 2. Patients ranged from 4 months to 63 years of age and the population was 52% male. Of the 79 patients, 87% were White, 5% were Black or African-American, 4% were Asian, and 4% other. The daily dosage of DOJOLVI ranged between 12% and 41% DCI (which corresponds to 0.7 g/kg/day to 6.0 g/kg/day for pediatric patients and 0.5 g/kg/day to 1.3 g/kg/day for adult patients) for a mean duration of 23 months. The most common adverse reactions to DOJOLVI reported in the pooled safety population of Study 1 and Study 2 were gastrointestinal (GI)-related, and included abdominal pain (abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, GI pain) [60%], diarrhea [44%], vomiting [44%], and nausea [14%]. Gastrointestinal (GI) Adverse Reactions In Study 1 and Study 2, median time to onset of a first occurrence of a GI adverse reaction was 7.3 weeks. GI adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 35% and 12% of patients in Study 1 and Study 2, respectively. In Study 3, a 4-month double-blind randomized controlled study, commonly reported adverse reactions with triheptanoin were similar to those reported in Study 1 and Study 2."
