    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor indicated: to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 1.7 ) to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), including patients after recent lower extremity revascularization due to symptomatic PAD ( 1.8 ) 1.7 Reduction of Risk of Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Rivaroxaban tablets, in combination with aspirin, are indicated to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) in adult patients with coronary artery disease. 1.8 Reduction of Risk of Major Thrombotic Vascular Events in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), Including Patients after Lower Extremity Revascularization due to Symptomatic PAD Rivaroxaban tablets, in combination with aspirin, are indicated to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, and major amputation of a vascular etiology) in adult patients with PAD, including patients who have recently undergone a lower extremity revascularization procedure due to symptomatic PAD.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Rivaroxaban tablets are contraindicated in patients with: active pathological bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] severe hypersensitivity reaction to rivaroxaban tablets (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] Active pathological bleeding ( 4 ) Severe hypersensitivity reaction to Rivaroxaban. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Bleeding : Rivaroxaban tablets can cause serious and fatal bleeding. An agent to reverse the activity of rivaroxaban is available. ( 5.2 ) Pregnancy-Related Hemorrhage : Use rivaroxaban with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for obstetric hemorrhage and/or emergent delivery. ( 5.7 , 8.1 ) Prosthetic Heart Valves : Rivaroxaban tablets use not recommended. ( 5.8 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome : Rivaroxaban tablets use not recommended. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including rivaroxaban tablets, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from rivaroxaban tablets to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If rivaroxaban tablets are discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( . 14.1 )] 5.2 Risk of Bleeding Rivaroxaban tablets increase the risk of bleeding and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. In deciding whether to prescribe rivaroxaban tablets to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue rivaroxaban tablets in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years. Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y 12 platelet inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions ( , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. 7.4 )] Concomitant use of drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase bleeding risk [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.2 )] Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available. Because of high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban.  Use of procoagulant reversal agents, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa, may be considered but has not been evaluated in clinical efficacy and safety studies. Monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using a clotting test (PT, INR or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not recommended. 12.3 )] 5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see . Boxed Warning ] To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of rivaroxaban tablets and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban tablets is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. 12.3 )] An indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheter should not be removed before at least 2 half-lives have elapsed (i.e., 18 hours in young patients aged 20 to 45 years and 26 hours in elderly patients aged 60 to 76 years), after the last administration of rivaroxaban tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . The next rivaroxaban tablets dose should not be administered earlier than 6 hours after the removal of the catheter. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of rivaroxaban tablets for 24 hours. 12.3 )] Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae. 5.4 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment Discontinue rivaroxaban tablets in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.6 )] 5.5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical data are available for adult patients with severe hepatic impairment. Avoid use of rivaroxaban tablets in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment or with any hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy since drug exposure and bleeding risk may be increased [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.7 )] 5.6 Use with P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers Avoid concomitant use of rivaroxaban tablets with known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.2 )] Avoid concomitant use of rivaroxaban tablets with drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.3 )] 5.7 Risk of Pregnancy-Related Hemorrhage In pregnant women, rivaroxaban tablets should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. Rivaroxaban tablets dosing in pregnancy has not been studied. The anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban tablets cannot be monitored with standard laboratory testing. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms suggesting blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, hypotension, or fetal distress) [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] 5.8 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves On the basis of the GALILEO study, use of rivaroxaban tablets is not recommended in patients who have had transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) because patients randomized to rivaroxaban tablets experienced higher rates of death and bleeding compared to those randomized to an anti-platelet regimen. The safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban tablets have not been studied in patients with other prosthetic heart valves or other valve procedures. Use of rivaroxaban tablets is not recommended in patients with prosthetic heart valves. 5.9 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients Who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy Initiation of rivaroxaban tablets are not recommended acutely as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. 5.10 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including rivaroxaban tablets, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the labeling: Increased Risk of Stroke After Discontinuation in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Bleeding Risk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.7 )] Spinal/Epidural Hematoma [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] The most common adverse reaction (>5 %) in adult patients was bleeding.

During clinical development for the approved indications, 34, 947 adult patients were exposed to rivaroxaban tablets. Hemorrhage The most common adverse reactions with rivaroxaban tablets were bleeding complications [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] Reduction of Risk of Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients with CAD: In the COMPASS trial overall, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were bleeding events, with incidence rates of 2.7 % for rivaroxaban tablets 2.5 mg twice daily vs. 1.2 % for placebo on background therapy for all patients with aspirin 100 mg once daily. The incidences of important bleeding events in the CAD and PAD populations in COMPASS were similar. Table 10 shows the number of patients experiencing various types of major bleeding events in the COMPASS trial. Table 10: Major Bleeding Events in COMPASS -On Treatment Plus 2 Days * * Major bleeding events within each subcategory were counted once per patient, but patients may have contributed events to multiple subcategories.
