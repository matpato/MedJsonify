    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the articles contained in this product. This product is contraindicated for individuals with conditions for which any of the ingredients are contraindicated. Iron therapy is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage disease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyridoxine responsive anemia, or cirrhosis of the liver.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS: Caution is recommended in patients with a family history of bipolar illness. Mood elevation is possible in this population. Caution is also recommended in patients taking anticonvulsant medications as folate may interfere with anticonvulsant medication, and may lower seizure threshold. Furthermore, it has been reported that anticonvulsant medications interfere with folate metabolism, but the exact action is unclear; therefore caution is recommended with patients in this therapeutic group. Patients undergoing cancer treatment should consult their licensed medical practitioner for advice. Folate alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where vitamin B 12 is deficient. Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations progress. Daily ingestion of more than 3 grams per day of omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, ALA, and EPA) may have potential antithrombotic activities, or effects, and may increase bleeding times. Administration of omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA, should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis, including those taking anticoagulants. Exercise caution to ensure that the prescribed dosage of DHA does not exceed 1 gram (1000 mg) per day.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic reactions have been reported following the use of oral and parenteral folate. xxix Mild transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, itching, transitory exanthema, and the feeling of swelling of the entire body have been associated with methylcobalamin. xxx Allergic reactions, acne, skin reactions, photosensitivity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, paresthesia, somnolence, nausea, and headaches have been associated with pyridoxal-5’-phosphate. xxxi Call your medical practitioner about side effects.
