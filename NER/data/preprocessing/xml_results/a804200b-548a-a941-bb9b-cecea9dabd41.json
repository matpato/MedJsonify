    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Nilotinib capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome [see Boxed Warning ]. Nilotinib capsules are contraindicated in patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myelosuppression : Monitor complete blood count (CBC) during therapy and manage by treatment interruption or dose-reduction. ( 5.1 ) Cardiac and Arterial Vascular Occlusive Events : Evaluate cardiovascular status, monitor and manage cardiovascular risk factors during nilotinib therapy. ( 5.4 ) Pancreatitis and Elevated Serum Lipase: Monitor serum lipase; if elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt doses and consider appropriate diagnostics to exclude pancreatitis. ( 5.5 ) Hepatotoxicity : Monitor hepatic function tests monthly or as clinically indicated. ( 5.6 ) Electrolyte Abnormalities : Nilotinib can cause hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia. Correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to initiating nilotinib and monitor periodically during therapy. ( 5.7 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Maintain adequate hydration and correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with nilotinib. ( 5.8 ) Hemorrhage : Hemorrhage from any site may occur. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of bleeding and medically manage as needed. ( 5.9 ) Fluid Retention : Monitor patients for unexpected rapid weight gain, swelling, and shortness of breath. Manage medically. ( 5.13 ) Effects on Growth and Development in Pediatric Patients : Growth retardation has been reported in pediatric patients treated with nilotinib. Monitor growth and development in pediatric patients. ( 5.14 ) Embryo-Fetal toxicity : Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.15 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) Treatment Discontinuation : Patients must have typical BCR-ABL transcripts. An FDA-authorized test with a detection limit below MR4.5 must be used to determine eligibility for discontinuation. Patients must be frequently monitored by the FDA authorized test to detect possible loss of remission. ( 5.16 ) 5.1   Myelosuppression Treatment with nilotinib can cause Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Perform CBCs every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by withholding nilotinib temporarily or dose reduction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 5.2   QT Prolongation Nilotinib has been shown to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarization as measured by the QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) in a concentration-dependent manner [see Adverse Reactions ( , 6.1 ) Clinical Pharmacology ( . Prolongation of the QT interval can result in a type of ventricular tachycardia called torsade de pointes, which may result in syncope, seizure, and/or death. Electrocardiograms should be performed at baseline, 7 days after initiation of nilotinib, and periodically as clinically indicated and following dose adjustments 12.2 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.12 )] Nilotinib should not be used in patients who have hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome. Before initiating nilotinib and periodically, test electrolyte, calcium, and magnesium blood levels. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to initiating nilotinib and these electrolytes should be monitored periodically during therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )]. Significant prolongation of the QT interval may occur when nilotinib is inappropriately taken with food and/or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a known potential to prolong QT. Therefore, coadministration with food must be avoided and concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with a known potential to prolong QT should be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( . The presence of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may further prolong the QT interval 2.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.12 )]. 5.3   Sudden Deaths Sudden deaths have been reported in 0.3% of patients with CML treated with nilotinib in clinical studies of 5661 patients. The relative early occurrence of some of these deaths relative to the initiation of nilotinib suggests the possibility that ventricular repolarization abnormalities may have contributed to their occurrence. 5.4 Cardiac and Arterial Vascular Occlusive Events Cardiovascular events, including arterial vascular occlusive events, were reported in a randomized, clinical trial in newly diagnosed CML patients and observed in the postmarketing reports of patients receiving nilotinib therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( . With a median time on therapy of 60 months in the clinical trial, cardiovascular events, including arterial vascular occlusive events, occurred in 9% and 15% of patients in the nilotinib 300 and 400 mg twice daily arms, respectively, and in 3.2% in the imatinib arm. These included cases of cardiovascular events, including ischemic heart disease-related cardiac events (5% and 9% in the nilotinib 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily arms, respectively, and 2.5% in the imatinib arm), peripheral arterial occlusive disease (3.6% and 2.9% in the nilotinib 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily arms, respectively, and 0% in the imatinib arm), and ischemic cerebrovascular events (1.4% and 3.2% in the nilotinib 300 mg and 400 mg twice daily arms, respectively and 0.7% in the imatinib arm). If acute signs or symptoms of cardiovascular events occur, advise patients to seek immediate medical attention. The cardiovascular status of patients should be evaluated and cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored and actively managed during nilotinib therapy according to standard guidelines 6.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.5 Pancreatitis and Elevated Serum Lipase Nilotinib capsules can cause increases in serum lipase [see Adverse Reactions ( . Patients with a previous history of pancreatitis may be at greater risk of elevated serum lipase. If lipase elevations are accompanied by abdominal symptoms, interrupt dosing and consider appropriate diagnostics to exclude pancreatitis 6.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . Test serum lipase levels monthly or as clinically indicated. 2.6 )] 5.6 Hepatotoxicity Nilotinib may result in hepatotoxicity as measured by elevations in bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase. Grade 3 to 4 elevations of bilirubin, AST, and ALT were reported at a higher frequency in pediatric than in adult patients. Monitor hepatic function tests monthly or as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions ( and following dose adjustments. 5.12 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.7 Electrolyte Abnormalities The use of nilotinib can cause hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia. Correct electrolyte abnormalities prior to initiating nilotinib and during therapy. Monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )]. 5.8 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) cases have been reported in nilotinib treated patients with resistant or intolerant CML. Malignant disease progression, high white blood cell (WBC) counts and/or dehydration were present in the majority of these cases. Due to potential for TLS, maintain adequate hydration and correct uric acid levels prior to initiating therapy with nilotinib. 5.9 Hemorrhage Serious hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have occurred in patients with CML treated with nilotinib. In a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing nilotinib and imatinib, Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 1.1% of patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm, in 1.8% of patients in the nilotinib 400 mg twice daily arm, and 0.4% of patients in the imatinib arm. GI hemorrhage occurred in 2.9% and 5% of patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily arms and in 1.4% of patients in the imatinib arm, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 events occurred in 0.7% and 1.4% of patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily arms, respectively, and in no patients in the imatinib arm. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding and medically manage as needed. 5.10 Total Gastrectomy Since the exposure of nilotinib is reduced in patients with total gastrectomy, perform more frequent monitoring of these patients. Consider dose increase or alternative therapy in patients with total gastrectomy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.11 Lactose Since the capsules contain lactose, nilotinib is not recommended for patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, severe lactase deficiency with a severe degree of intolerance to lactose-containing products, or of glucose-galactose malabsorption. 5.12 Monitoring Laboratory Tests Complete blood counts should be performed every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter. Perform chemistry panels, including electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glucose prior to therapy and periodically. Electrocardiograms should be obtained at baseline, 7 days after initiation and periodically thereafter, as well as following dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions ( . Monitor lipid profiles and glucose periodically during the first year of nilotinib therapy and at least yearly during chronic therapy. Should treatment with any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a lipid lowering agent) be needed to treat lipid elevations, evaluate the potential for a drug-drug interaction before initiating therapy as certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway 5.2 )] [se e Drug Interactions ( . Assess glucose levels before initiating treatment with nilotinib and monitor during treatment as clinically indicated. If test results warrant therapy, physicians should follow their local standards of practice and treatment guidelines. 7.1 )] 5.13 Fluid Retention In the randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe (Grade 3 or 4) fluid retention occurred in 3.9% and 2.9% of patients receiving nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.5% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions (including pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites) or pulmonary edema, were observed in 2.2% and 1.1% of patients receiving nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in 2.1% of patients receiving imatinib. Effusions were severe (Grade 3 or 4) in 0.7% and 0.4% of patients receiving nilotinib 300 mg twice daily and 400 mg twice daily, respectively, and in no patients receiving imatinib. Similar events were also observed in postmarketing reports. Monitor patients for signs of severe fluid retention (e.g., unexpected rapid weight gain or swelling) and for symptoms of respiratory or cardiac compromise (e.g., shortness of breath) during nilotinib treatment; evaluate etiology and treat patients accordingly. 5.14 Effects on Growth and Development in Pediatric Patients Growth retardation has been reported in pediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase treated with nilotinib capsules. In a pediatric trial with 58 patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase with a median exposure of 56.7 months, growth deceleration (crossing at least two main height percentile lines from baseline) was observed in eight patients: five (9%) crossed two main percentile lines from baseline and three (5%) crossed three main percentile lines from baseline (percentile lines: 5 th , 10 th , 25 th , 50 th , 75 th , 90 th , and 95 th ). Growth deceleration was more pronounced in children who were less than age 12 at baseline. Adverse reactions associated with growth retardation were reported in 3 patients (5%). Monitor growth and development in pediatric patients receiving nilotinib treatment. 5.15 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, nilotinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nilotinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including embryo-fetal lethality/fetal effects (small renal papilla, fetal edema, and skeletal variations) in rats and increased resorptions of fetuses and fetal skeletal variations in rabbits at maternal area under the curve (AUCs) approximately 2 and 0.5 times, respectively, the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for  14 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. 5.16 Monitoring of BCR-ABL Transcript Levels Monitoring of BCR-ABL Transcript Levels in Patients Who Discontinued Nilotinib Capsules Monitor BCR-ABL transcript levels in patients eligible for treatment discontinuation using an FDA authorized test validated to measure molecular response levels with a sensitivity of at least MR4.5 (BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.0032% IS). In patients who discontinue nilotinib therapy, assess BCR-ABL transcript levels monthly for one year, then every 6 weeks for the second year, and every 12 weeks thereafter during treatment discontinuation [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.4 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. Newly diagnosed patients must reinitiate nilotinib therapy within 4 weeks of a loss of major molecular response [(MMR), corresponding to MR3.0 or = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.1% IS]. Patients resistant or intolerant to prior treatment which included imatinib must reinitiate nilotinib therapy within 4 weeks of a loss of MMR or confirmed loss of MR4.0 (two consecutive measures separated by at least 4 weeks showing loss of MR4.0, corresponding to = BCR-ABL/ABL ≤ 0.01% IS). For patients who fail to achieve MMR after three months of treatment reinitiation, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation testing should be performed. Monitoring of BCR-ABL Transcript Levels in Patients Who Have Reinitiated Therapy After Loss of Molecular Response Monitor CBC and BCR-ABL transcripts in patients who reinitiate treatment with nilotinib due to loss of molecular response quantitation every 4 weeks until a major molecular response is re-established, then every 12 weeks.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions can occur with nilotinib and are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] QT Prolongation [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Sudden Deaths [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Cardiac and Arterial Vascular Occlusive Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Pancreatitis and Elevated Serum Lipase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Electrolyte Abnormalities [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Fluid Retention [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] The most commonly reported non-hematologic adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in adult and pediatric patients were nausea, rash, headache, fatigue, pruritus, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, constipation, arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, and night sweats. Hematologic adverse drug reactions include myelosuppression: thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-667-4708 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1   Clinical  Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP The data below reflect exposure to nilotinib from a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase treated at the recommended dose of 300 mg twice daily (n = 279). The median time on treatment in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily group was 61 months (range, 0.1 to 71 months). The median actual dose intensity was 593 mg/day in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily group. The most common (greater than 10%) non-hematologic adverse drug reactions were rash, pruritus, headache, nausea, fatigue, alopecia, myalgia, and upper abdominal pain. Constipation, diarrhea, dry skin, muscle spasms, arthralgia, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, vomiting, and asthenia were observed less commonly (less than or equal to 10% and greater than 5%) and have been of mild-to-moderate severity, manageable and generally did not require dose reduction. Increase in QTcF greater than 60 msec from baseline was observed in 1 patient (0.4%) in the 300 mg twice daily treatment group. No patient had an absolute QTcF of greater than 500 msec while on study drug. The most common hematologic adverse drug reactions (all Grades) were myelosuppression, including: thrombocytopenia (18%), neutropenia (15%), and anemia (8%). See Table 9 for Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, was observed in 10% of patients. In Adult Patients With Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP In the single-arm, open-label multicenter clinical trial, a total of 458 patients with Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP resistant to or intolerant to at least one prior therapy, including imatinib were treated (CML-CP=321; CML-AP = 137) at the recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily. The median duration of exposure in days for CML-CP and CML-AP patients is 561 (range, 1 to 1096) and 264 (range, 2 to 1160), respectively. The median dose intensity for patients with CML-CP and CML-AP is 789 mg/day (range, 151 to 1110) and 780 mg/day (range, 150 to 1149), respectively, and corresponded to the planned 400 mg twice daily dosing. The median cumulative duration in days of dose interruptions for the CML-CP patients was 20 (range, 1 to 345), and the median duration in days of dose interruptions for the CML-AP patients was 23 (range, 1 to 234). In patients with CML-CP, the most commonly reported non-hematologic adverse drug reactions (greater than or equal to 10%) were rash, pruritus, nausea, fatigue, headache, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and myalgia. The common serious drug-related adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 1% and less than 10%) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. In patients with CML-AP, the most commonly reported non-hematologic adverse drug reactions (greater than or equal to 10%) were rash, pruritus and fatigue. The common serious adverse drug reactions (greater than or equal to 1% and less than 10%) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, leukopenia, intracranial hemorrhage, elevated lipase, and pyrexia. Sudden deaths and QT prolongation were reported. The maximum mean QTcF change from baseline at steady- state was 10 msec. Increase in QTcF greater than 60 msec from baseline was observed in 4.1% of the patients and QTcF of greater than 500 msec was observed in 4 patients (less than 1%) [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Discontinuation due to adverse drug reactions was observed in 16% of CML-CP and 10% of CML-AP patients.

Elevated total cholesterol (all Grades) occurred in 28% (nilotinib 300 mg twice daily) and 4% (imatinib). Elevated triglycerides (all Grades) occurred in 12% and 8% of patients in the nilotinib and imatinib arms, respectively. Hyperglycemia (all Grades) occurred in 50% and 31% of patients in the nilotinib and imatinib arms, respectively. Most common biochemistry laboratory abnormalities (all Grades) were alanine aminotransferase increased (72%), blood bilirubin increased (59%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (47%), lipase increased (28%), blood glucose increased (50%), blood cholesterol increased (28%), and blood triglyceride increased (12%). Treatment Discontinuation in Patients With Ph+ CML-CP patients Who Have Achieved a Sustained Molecular Response (MR4.5) In eligible patients who discontinued nilotinib therapy after attaining a sustained molecular response (MR4.5), musculoskeletal symptoms (e.g., myalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, bone pain, spinal pain, or musculoskeletal pain), were reported more frequently than before treatment discontinuation in the first year, as noted in Table 10. The rate of new musculoskeletal symptoms generally decreased in the second year after treatment discontinuation. In the newly diagnosed population in whom musculoskeletal symptoms occurred at any time during the TFR phase, 23/53 (43%) had not resolved by the TFR end date or data cut-off date. In the population previously treated with imatinib in whom musculoskeletal events occurred at any time during the TFR phase, 32/57 (56%) had not resolved by the data cut-off date. The rate of musculoskeletal symptoms decreased in patients who entered the nilotinib treatment reinitiation (NTRI) phase, at 11/88 (13%) in the newly diagnosed population and 14/56 (25%) in the population previously treated with imatinib. Other adverse reactions observed in the nilotinib re-treatment phase were similar to those observed during nilotinib use in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP and resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP.

In Pediatric Patients With Newly Diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP or Resistant or Intolerant Ph+ CML-CP The data below reflect exposure to nilotinib capsules from two studies in pediatric patients from 2 to less than 18 years of age with either newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP or imatinib/dasatinib resistant or intolerant Ph+ CML-CP treated at the recommended dose of 230 mg/m 2 twice daily (n = 69) [see Clinical Studies ( . The median time on treatment with nilotinib capsules was 39.6 months (range, 0.7 to 63.5 months). The median actual dose intensity was 427.7 mg/m 14.5 )] 2 /day (range 149.1 to 492.8 mg/m 2 /day), and the median relative dose intensity was 93% (range, 32.4 to 107.1%). Thirty-nine patients (57%) had relative dose intensity superior to 90%. In pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP, the most common (greater than 20%) non-hematologic adverse reactions were hyperbilirubinemia, headache, alanine aminotransferase increased, rash, pyrexia, nausea, aspartate aminotransferase increased, pain in extremity, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis. The most common (greater than 5%) Grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse reactions were hyperbilirubinemia, rash, alanine aminotransferase increased, and neutropenia. Laboratory abnormalities of hyperbilirubinemia (Grade 3/4: 16%) and transaminase elevation (AST Grade 3/4: 2.9%, ALT Grade 3/4: 10%), were reported at a higher frequency than in adult patients. The most common hematological laboratory abnormalities (greater than or equal to 30% of patients, of all Grades) were decreases in total white blood cells (54%), platelet count (44%), absolute neutrophils (44%), hemoglobin (38%), and absolute lymphocytes (36%). Discontinuation of study treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15 patients (22%). The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were hyperbilirubinemia (9%) and rash (6%). Increase in QTcF greater than 30 msec from baseline was observed in 19 patients (28%). No patient had an absolute QTcF of greater than 500 msec or QTcF increase of greater than 60 msec from baseline. Growth Retardation in Pediatric Population In a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of 58 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed or resistant Ph+ CML-CP treated with nilotinib, with a median exposure of 56.7 months, adverse reactions associated with growth and deceleration of growth in regard to height were reported in 3 patients (5%). The adverse reactions include growth retardation in 2 adolescent patients and growth hormone deficiency with short stature in the remaining patient (age category: child). Of the 58 pediatric patients, five (9%) crossed two main percentile lines from baseline and three (5%) crossed three main percentile lines from baseline (percentile lines: 5 th , 10 th , 25 th , 50 th , 75 th , 90 th , and 95 th ). Close monitoring of growth in pediatric patients under nilotinib treatment is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.14 )] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of nilotinib. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
