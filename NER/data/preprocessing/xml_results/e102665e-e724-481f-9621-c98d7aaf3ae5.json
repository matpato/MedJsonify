    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with cabotegravir- and rilpivirine-containing regimens. Reactions associated with cabotegravir include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Reactions associated with rilpivirine-containing regimens include cases of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Discontinue CABENUVA immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop. ( 5.1 ) • Serious post-injection reactions with rilpivirine were reported. Monitor and treat as clinically indicated. ( 5.2 ) • Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving cabotegravir or rilpivirine. Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended. Discontinue CABENUVA if hepatotoxicity is suspected. ( 5.3 ) • Depressive disorders have been reported with CABENUVA. Prompt evaluation is recommended for depressive symptoms. ( 5.4 ) • Residual concentrations of cabotegravir and rilpivirine may remain in the systemic circulation of patients up to 12 months or longer. It is essential to initiate an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than 1 month after the final injections of CABENUVA when dosed monthly and no later than 2 months after the final injections when dosed every 2 months. If virologic failure is suspected, prescribe an alternative regimen as soon as possible. ( 5.6 ) 5.1\tHypersensitivity Reactions Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with cabotegravir- and rilpivirine-containing regimens. Reactions associated with cabotegravir include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [see Adverse Reactions ( Reactions associated with rilpivirine-containing regimens include cases of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 6.2 )]. [see Adverse Reactions ( While some skin reactions were accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, other skin reactions were associated with organ dysfunctions, including elevations in hepatic serum biochemistries. Administration of cabotegravir and rilpivirine oral lead-in dosing was used in clinical studies to help identify patients who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction 6.1 , 6.2 )]. [see Dosage and Administration ( Remain vigilant and discontinue CABENUVA if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected 2.3 ), Contraindications ( 4 )]. [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Discontinue CABENUVA immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash, or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, mucosal involvement [oral blisters or lesions], conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing). Clinical status, including liver transaminases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. For information regarding the long-acting properties of CABENUVA, [see Warnings and Precautions ( . Administer oral lead-in dosing prior to administration of CABENUVA to help identify patients who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction 5.6 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 ), Contraindications ( 4 )] 5.2\tPost-Injection Reactions In clinical trials, serious post-injection reactions were reported within minutes after the injection of rilpivirine. These events included symptoms such as dyspnea, bronchospasm, agitation, abdominal cramping, rash/urticaria, dizziness, flushing, sweating, oral numbness, changes in blood pressure, and pain (e.g., back and chest). These events were reported in <1% of participants and began to resolve within minutes after the injection, with some patients receiving supportive care. These events may have been associated with accidental intravenous administration during the intramuscular injection procedure [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Carefully follow the Instructions for Use when preparing and administering CABENUVA. The suspensions should be injected slowly via intramuscular injection, and care should be taken to avoid accidental intravenous administration [see Dosage and Administration ( . Observe patients briefly (approximately 10 minutes) after the injection. If a patient experiences a post-injection reaction, monitor and treat as clinically indicated. 2.9 )] 5.3\tHepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving cabotegravir or rilpivirine with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease or identifiable risk factors [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Patients with underlying liver disease or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations. Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended and treatment with CABENUVA should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity is suspected. For information regarding the long-acting properties of CABENUVA, [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.6 )] 5.4\tDepressive Disorders Depressive disorders (including depressed mood, depression, major depression, mood altered, mood swings, dysphoria, negative thoughts, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt) have been reported with CABENUVA or the individual drug products [see Adverse Reactions ( . Promptly evaluate patients with depressive symptoms to assess whether the symptoms are related to CABENUVA and to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits. 6.1 )] 5.5\tRisk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of CABENUVA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse events, loss of virologic response of CABENUVA, and possible development of viral resistance [see Contraindications ( . 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] Rilpivirine 75-mg and 300-mg once-daily oral doses (3 and 12 times, respectively, the recommended oral dosage) in healthy adults prolonged the QTc interval with mean steady-state C max values 4.4- and 11.6-fold, respectively, higher than C max values associated with the recommended 600-mg monthly dose of rilpivirine extended-release injectable suspension and 4.1- and 10.7-fold, respectively, higher than C max values associated with the recommended 900-mg every-2-month dose of rilpivirine extended‑release injectable suspension [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . CABENUVA should be used with caution in combination with drugs with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes 12.2 )] [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.3 , 7.4 )] See Table 8 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with, and after discontinuation of, CABENUVA; review concomitant medications during therapy with CABENUVA [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.4 )] 5.6\tLong-Acting Properties and Potential Associated Risks with CABENUVA Residual concentrations of both cabotegravir and rilpivirine may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods (up to 12 months or longer). It is important to carefully select patients who agree to the required monthly or every-2-month injection dosing schedule because non-adherence to monthly or every-2-month injections or missed doses could lead to loss of virologic response and development of resistance [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] To minimize the potential risk of developing viral resistance, it is essential to initiate an alternative, fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen no later than 1 month after the final injections of CABENUVA when dosed monthly and no later than 2 months after the final injections of CABENUVA when dosed every 2 months. If virologic failure is suspected, switch the patient to an alternative regimen as soon as possible.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described below and in other sections of the labeling: • Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] • Post-injection reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] • Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] • Depressive disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] The most common adverse reactions (Grades 1 to 4) observed in ≥2% of participants receiving CABENUVA were injection site reactions, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, sleep disorders, dizziness, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact ViiV Healthcare at 1-877-844-8872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials Experience in Adults The safety assessment of CABENUVA is based on the analysis of pooled 48-week data from 1,182 virologically suppressed participants with HIV-1 infection in 2 international, multicenter, open-label pivotal trials, FLAIR and ATLAS, and 1,045 virologically suppressed participants from the ATLAS-2M trial [see Clinical Studies ( . Additional safety information from other ongoing or earlier clinical trials in the cabotegravir and rilpivirine program have been considered in assessing the overall safety profile of CABENUVA. 14.1 )] Adverse reactions were reported following exposure to CABENUVA extended-release injectable suspensions (median time exposure at the time of analysis: 54 weeks in FLAIR and ATLAS, and 64 weeks in ATLAS-2M) and data from VOCABRIA (cabotegravir) tablets and EDURANT (rilpivirine) tablets administered in combination as oral lead-in therapy (median time exposure: 5.3 weeks in FLAIR and ATLAS, and 5.6 weeks in ATLAS-2M). Adverse reactions included those attributable to both the oral and injectable formulations of cabotegravir and rilpivirine administered as a combination regimen. Refer to the prescribing information for EDURANT (rilpivirine) for other adverse reactions associated with oral rilpivirine. The most common adverse reactions regardless of severity reported in ≥2% of adult participants from FLAIR and ATLAS at Week 48 are presented in Table 5 . Selected laboratory abnormalities are included in Table 7 . At Week 96, the overall safety profile for FLAIR was consistent with that observed at Week 48, with no new safety findings identified. In the extension phase of the FLAIR study at Week 124, the overall safety profile was consistent with that observed at Week 48 and when injection therapy with CABENUVA was initiated directly without the oral lead-in phase. Overall, 4% of participants in the group receiving CABENUVA and 2% of participants in the control group in FLAIR and ATLAS discontinued due to adverse events. Non-injection-site-related adverse events leading to discontinuation and occurring in more than 1 participant were headache, diarrhea, hepatitis A, and acute hepatitis B (all with an incidence <1%). In ATLAS-2M, 2% of participants in both treatment groups discontinued due to adverse events. Non-injection-site–related adverse events leading to discontinuation and occurring in more than 1 participant in ATLAS-2M were fatigue, pyrexia, headache, presyncope, acute hepatitis B, hyperhidrosis, and abnormal dreams that occurred with an incidence of ≤1% in either treatment group.

Differences between treatment arms were reported for the types of injection-associated adverse reactions (see Injection-Associated Adverse Reactions for additional information). Injection-Associated Adverse Reactions: Local Injection Site Reactions (ISRs): In the 3 Phase 3 studies, FLAIR, ATLAS, and ATLAS‑2M, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with the intramuscular administration of CABENUVA were ISRs. In the pooled analysis of FLAIR and ATLAS, 83% of participants reported any injection site reaction with the monthly dosing regimen, with 1% of participants who discontinued treatment with CABENUVA because of ISRs. After 14,682 injections, 3,663 ISRs were reported. The severity of ISRs was generally mild (Grade 1: 75% of participants) or moderate (Grade 2: 36% of participants). Four percent (4%) of participants experienced severe (Grade 3) ISRs, and no participant experienced Grade 4 ISRs. The median duration of overall ISR events was 3 days. The most commonly reported ISR in FLAIR and ATLAS was pain/discomfort, with 79% reported in the group receiving CABENUVA. In ATLAS-2M, 75% of participants reported any injection site reaction in both the monthly and every‑2‑month dosing regimens, with <1% of participants who discontinued treatment with CABENUVA because of ISRs. When dosing monthly, after 15,711 injections, 3,152 ISRs were reported. When dosing every 2 months, after 8,470 injections, 2,507 ISRs were reported. The severity of ISRs was generally mild (Grade 1: 70% and 71% of participants) or moderate (Grade 2: 28% and 27% of participants) in monthly and every‑2‑month dosing regimens, respectively. Four percent (4%) of participants in the monthly group and 3% of participants in the every‑2‑month group experienced severe (Grade 3) ISRs, and no participant experienced Grade 4 ISRs. The median duration of overall ISR events was 3 days for both dosing regimens. The most commonly reported ISR in ATLAS‑2M was pain/discomfort, with 71% and 73% reported in the monthly and every‑2‑month dosing regimens, respectively. The severity and duration of ISRs, including pain/discomfort, were similar for both dosing regimens and in participants without prior exposure to CABENUVA. The most commonly reported ISR (Grades 1 to 3) in at least 1% of adult participants in the pooled analyses from FLAIR and ATLAS, and from ATLAS‑2M, are presented in Table 6 . The side‑by‑side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trials. Table 6. Injection Site Reactions (Grades 1 to 3) Reported in at Least 1% of Participants in FLAIR and ATLAS (Pooled Analysis) and ATLAS-2M Trials (Week 48 Analysis) Anesthesia, abscess, cellulitis, and hemorrhage at the injection site were each reported in <1% of participants.

In ATLAS and FLAIR, no cases were serious or led to withdrawal and the occurrences of pyrexia may represent a response to administration of CABENUVA via intramuscular injection. In ATLAS-2M, 1 participant in each arm reported pyrexia that led to withdrawal. In ATLAS and FLAIR, reports of musculoskeletal pain (3%) and less frequently, sciatica, were also more common in participants receiving cabotegravir plus rilpivirine compared with the current antiretroviral regimen and some events had a temporal association with injection. Vasovagal or pre-syncopal reactions were reported in <1% of participants after injection with rilpivirine or cabotegravir. Less Common Adverse Reactions: The following select adverse reactions (regardless of severity) occurred in <2% of participants receiving cabotegravir plus rilpivirine. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain (including upper abdominal pain), gastritis, dyspepsia, vomiting, diarrhea, and flatulence. Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatotoxicity. Investigations: Weight increase (see below) . Psychiatric Disorders: Anxiety (including anxiety and irritability), depression, abnormal dreams, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt (these events were observed primarily in participants with a pre-existing history of depression or other psychiatric illness). Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions. Weight Increase: At Week 48, participants in FLAIR and ATLAS who received cabotegravir plus rilpivirine had a median weight gain of 1.5 kg; those in the current antiretroviral regimen group had a median weight gain of 1.0 kg (pooled analysis). In the FLAIR trial, the median weight gain in participants receiving cabotegravir plus rilpivirine or a dolutegravir-containing regimen was 1.3 kg and 1.5 kg, respectively, compared with 1.8 kg and 0.3 kg, respectively, in the ATLAS trial in participants receiving either cabotegravir plus rilpivirine or a protease inhibitor-, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-, or integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-containing regimen, respectively. At Week 48, participants in ATLAS-2M who received cabotegravir plus rilpivirine in both the monthly and every-2-month treatment arms had a median weight gain of 1.0 kg. Laboratory Abnormalities: Selected laboratory abnormalities with a worsening grade from baseline and representing the worst-grade toxicity are presented in Table 7 . The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trials. Table 7. Selected Laboratory Abnormalities (Grades 3 to 4, Week 48) in FLAIR and ATLAS (Pooled Analyses) and ATLAS-2M Trials ALT = Alanine Aminotransferase, ULN = Upper limit of normal, AST = Aspartate Transaminase. Laboratory Parameter FLAIR and ATLAS ATLAS-2M Cabotegravir plus Rilpivirine Once Monthly (n = 591) Current Antiretroviral Regimen (n = 591) Cabotegravir plus Rilpivirine Once Every 2 Months (n = 522) Cabotegravir plus Rilpivirine Once Monthly (n = 523) ALT (≥5.0 x ULN) 2% <1% <1% <1% AST (≥5.0 x ULN) 2% <1% <1% 1% Total bilirubin (≥2.6 x ULN) <1% <1% <1% <1% Creatine phosphokinase (≥10.0 x ULN) 8% 4% 3% 4% Lipase (≥3.0 x ULN) 5% 3% 3% 2% Changes in Total Bilirubin: Small, non-progressive increases in total bilirubin (without clinical jaundice) were observed with cabotegravir plus rilpivirine. These changes are not considered clinically relevant as they likely reflect competition between cabotegravir and unconjugated bilirubin for a common clearance pathway (UGT1A1) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Serum Cortisol: In pooled Phase 3 trials of EDURANT (rilpivirine), the overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol was -0.69 (-1.12, 0.27) mcg/dL in the group receiving EDURANT compared with -0.02 (-0.48, 0.44) mcg/dL in the control group. Abnormal responses to ACTH stimulation tests were also higher in the group receiving EDURANT. The clinical significance of the higher abnormal rate of ACTH stimulation tests in the group receiving EDURANT is not known. Refer to the prescribing information for EDURANT for additional information. Clinical Trial Experience in Adolescents Based on data from the Week 16 (cohort 1) and Week 24 (cohort 2) analyses of the MOCHA study, the safety profile in adolescents (aged 12 to younger than 18 years and weighing ≥35 kg) was consistent with the safety profile established with cabotegravir plus rilpivirine in adults [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.2 )] In cohort 1, 55 virologically suppressed adolescents with HIV-1 received background antiretroviral therapy in addition to either oral cabotegravir (n = 30) followed by injectable cabotegravir (n = 29), or oral rilpivirine (n = 25) followed by injectable rilpivirine (n = 23). Adverse reactions were reported in 38% of adolescents receiving either cabotegravir or rilpivirine. Thirty-three percent of participants reported at least 1 ISR. All ISRs were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Two participants had Grade 3 adverse reactions of hypersensitivity (n = 1, oral rilpivirine) and insomnia (n = 1, injectable cabotegravir). The Grade 3 adverse reaction of drug hypersensitivity led to discontinuation of rilpivirine during oral lead-in. The adverse reactions reported by more than one participant (regardless of severity) were injection site pain (n = 18), headache (n = 2), hypersensitivity (n = 2), insomnia (n = 2), and nausea (n = 2). In cohort 2, 144 virologically suppressed adolescents with HIV-1 received oral cabotegravir plus oral rilpivirine followed by injectable cabotegravir plus injectable rilpivirine. Adverse reactions were reported in 35% of adolescents receiving cabotegravir plus rilpivirine. Thirty-four percent of participants reported at least 1 ISR. The majority of these participants experienced Grade 1 or Grade 2 ISRs. Two participants had Grade 3 ISRs consisting of injection site abscess (n = 2) and injection site pain in one of these two participants (symptoms resolved in both participants). All non-ISR adverse reactions were ≤ Grade 2. Non-injection-site associated adverse reactions reported by more than one participant (regardless of severity) were headache (n = 3), nausea (n = 2), rash (n = 2) and rash pruritic (n = 2). 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing experience in patients receiving cabotegravir- or oral-rilpivirine-containing regimens. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema and urticaria) [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )] Renal and Genitourinary Disorders Nephrotic syndrome. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including DRESS, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )]"
