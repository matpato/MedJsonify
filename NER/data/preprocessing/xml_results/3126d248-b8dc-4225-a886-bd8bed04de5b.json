  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diarrhea: VERZENIO can cause severe cases of diarrhea, associated with dehydration and infection. Instruct patients at the first sign of loose stools to initiate antidiarrheal therapy, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) Interstitial Lung Disease ( ILD ) /Pneumonitis: Severe and fatal cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been reported. Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue VERZENIO in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Hepatotoxicity: Increases in serum transaminase levels have been observed. Perform liver function tests ( LFTs ) before initiating treatment with VERZENIO. Monitor LFTs every two weeks for the first two months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) Venous Thromboembolism: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Diarrhea Severe diarrhea associated with dehydration and infection occurred in patients treated with VERZENIO. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, diarrhea occurred in 81% to 90% of patients who received VERZENIO. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 8% to 20% of patients receiving VERZENIO [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Most patients experienced diarrhea during the first month of VERZENIO treatment. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event ranged from 6 to 8 days; and the median duration of Grade 2 and Grade 3 diarrhea ranged from 6 to 11 days and 5 to 8 days, respectively. Across trials, 19% to 26% of patients with diarrhea required a VERZENIO dose interruption and 13% to 23% required a dose reduction. Instruct patients to start antidiarrheal therapy such as loperamide at the first sign of loose stools, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow up [see Patient Counseling Information ( For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue VERZENIO until toxicity resolves to ≤Grade 1, and then resume VERZENIO at the next lower dose 17 ) ] . [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ) ] 5.2 Neutropenia Neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis, occurred in patients treated with VERZENIO. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, neutropenia occurred in a 37% to 46% of patients receiving VERZENIO. A Grade ≥3 decrease in neutrophil count ( based on laboratory findings ) occurred in 19% to 32% of patients receiving VERZENIO. Across trials, the median time to the first episode of Grade ≥3 neutropenia ranged from 29 days to 33 days, and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia ranged from 11 days to 16 days [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 ) ] Febrile neutropenia has been reported in <1% of patients exposed to VERZENIO across trials. Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider [see Patient Counseling Information ( . 17 ) ] Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ) ] 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease ( ILD ) or Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with VERZENIO and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. In VERZENIO-treated patients in early breast cancer ( monarchE, N=2791 ) , 3% of patients experienced ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.4% were Grade 3 or 4 and there was one fatality ( 0.1% ) . In VERZENIO-treated patients in advanced or metastatic breast cancer ( N=900 ) ( MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3 ) , 3.3% of VERZENIO-treated patients had ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.6% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.4% had fatal outcomes. Additional cases of ILD or pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 ) ] Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis. Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Dose interruption or dose reduction is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 ILD or pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue VERZENIO in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ) ] 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Grade ≥3 ALT ( 2% to 6% ) and AST ( 2% to 3% ) were reported in patients receiving VERZENIO. Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients ( monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3 ) , the median time to onset of Grade ≥3 ALT increases ranged from 57 to 87 days and the median time to resolution to Grade <3 was 13 to 14 days. The median time to onset of Grade ≥3 AST increases ranged from 71 to 185 days and the median time to resolution to Grade <3 ranged from 11 to 15 days. Monitor liver function tests ( LFTs ) prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or any Grade 3 or Grade 4 hepatic transaminase elevation [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ) ] 5.5 Venous Thromboembolism Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients ( monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3 ) , venous thromboembolic events were reported in 2% to 5% of patients treated with VERZENIO. Venous thromboembolic events included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. In clinical trials, deaths due to venous thromboembolism have been reported in patients treated with VERZENIO. VERZENIO has not been studied in patients with early breast cancer who had a history of venous thromboembolism. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. Dose interruption is recommended for early breast cancer patients with any grade venous thromboembolic event and for advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients with a Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic event [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ) ] 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, VERZENIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve ( AUC ) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VERZENIO and for 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ]",

Alternative markers such as BUN, cystatin C, or calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , which are not based on creatinine, may be considered to determine whether renal function is impaired. 12.3 ) ] MONARCH 1: VERZENIO Administered as a Monotherapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who received prior endocrine therapy and 1-2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting The safety of VERZENIO was evaluated in MONARCH 1, a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in 132 women with measurable HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer [see Clinical Studies ( . Patients received 200 mg VERZENIO orally twice daily until development of progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity. Median duration of treatment was 4.5 months. 14.2 ) ] The most frequently reported ( ≥5% ) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, and leukopenia. Deaths due to adverse reactions during treatment or during the 30-day follow up were reported in 2% of patients. Cause of death in these patients was due to infection ( 2 patients ) or pneumonitis ( 1 patient ) . Ten patients ( 8% ) discontinued study treatment from adverse reactions due to ( 1 patient each ) , abdominal pain, arterial thrombosis, aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) increased, blood creatinine increased, chronic kidney disease, diarrhea, ECG QT prolonged, fatigue, hip fracture, and lymphopenia. Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 58% of patients. The most frequent ( ≥5% ) adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions were diarrhea ( 24% ) , neutropenia ( 16% ) , fatigue ( 10% ) , vomiting ( 6% ) , and nausea ( 5% ) . Forty-nine percent of patients had dose reductions due to an adverse reaction. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were diarrhea ( 20% ) , neutropenia ( 11% ) , and fatigue ( 9% ) . The most common reported adverse reactions ( ≥20% ) were: diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, neutropenia, vomiting, infections, anemia, headache, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions are shown in Table 14 and laboratory abnormalities in Table 15 . Table 14: Adverse Reactions ( ≥10% ) of Patients in MONARCH 1 a Includes asthenia, fatigue.
