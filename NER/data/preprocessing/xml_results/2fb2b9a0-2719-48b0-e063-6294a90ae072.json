    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE OPSUMIT is an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) in adults to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for PAH ( 1.1 ). 1.1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension OPSUMIT is an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) in adults to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for PAH. Effectiveness was established in a long-term study in PAH patients with predominantly WHO Functional Class II–III symptoms treated for an average of 2 years. Patients had idiopathic and heritable PAH (57%), PAH caused by connective tissue disorders (31%), and PAH caused by congenital heart disease with repaired shunts (8%) [see . Clinical Studies (14.1) ]",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy ( 4.1 ) Hypersensitivity ( 4.2 ) 4.1 Pregnancy OPSUMIT may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. OPSUMIT is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. OPSUMIT was consistently shown to have teratogenic effects when administered to animals. If OPSUMIT is used during pregnancy, advise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 4.2 Hypersensitivity OPSUMIT is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to macitentan or any component of the product [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ERAs cause hepatotoxicity and liver failure. Obtain baseline liver enzymes and monitor as clinically indicated ( 5.3 ). Fluid retention may require intervention ( 5.4 ) Decreases in hemoglobin ( 5.5 ). Pulmonary edema in patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. If confirmed, discontinue treatment ( 5.6 ). Decreases in sperm count have been observed in patients taking ERAs ( 5.7 ). 5.1 Embryo-fetal Toxicity OPSUMIT may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and is contraindicated for use in females who are pregnant. In females of reproductive potential, exclude pregnancy prior to initiation of therapy, ensure use of acceptable contraceptive methods and obtain monthly pregnancy tests [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] OPSUMIT is available for females through the Macitentan-Containing Products REMS, a restricted distribution program [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] 5.2 Macitentan-Containing Products REMS For all females, OPSUMIT is available only through a restricted program called the Macitentan-Containing Products REMS, because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity [see . Contraindications (4.1) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] Notable requirements of the Macitentan-Containing Products REMS include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the Macitentan-Containing Products REMS by enrolling and completing training. All females, regardless of reproductive potential, must enroll in the Macitentan-Containing Products REMS prior to initiating OPSUMIT. Male patients are not enrolled in the REMS. Females of reproductive potential must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Pharmacies must be certified with the Macitentan-Containing Products REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive OPSUMIT. Further information is available at www.MacitentanREMS.com or 1-888-572-2934. Information on Macitentan-Containing Products REMS certified pharmacies or wholesale distributors is available at 1-888-572-2934. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity ERAs have caused elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure. The incidence of elevated aminotransferases in the study of OPSUMIT in PAH is shown in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Elevated Aminotransferases in the SERAPHIN Study OPSUMIT 10 mg (N=242) Placebo (N=249) >3 × ULN 3.4% 4.5% >8 × ULN 2.1% 0.4% In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT, discontinuations for hepatic adverse events were 3.3% in the OPSUMIT 10 mg group vs. 1.6% for placebo. Obtain liver enzyme tests prior to initiation of OPSUMIT and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Advise patients to report symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, fever, or itching). If clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur, or if elevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin >2 × ULN, or by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity, discontinue OPSUMIT. Consider re-initiation of OPSUMIT when hepatic enzyme levels normalize in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity. 5.4 Fluid Retention Peripheral edema and fluid retention are known clinical consequences of PAH and known effects of ERAs. In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, the incidence of edema was 21.9% in the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and 20.5% in the placebo group. Patients with underlying left ventricular dysfunction may be at particular risk for developing significant fluid retention after initiation of ERA treatment. In a small study of OPSUMIT in patients with pulmonary hypertension because of left ventricular dysfunction, more patients in the OPSUMIT group developed significant fluid retention and had more hospitalizations because of worsening heart failure compared to those randomized to placebo. Postmarketing cases of edema and fluid retention occurring within weeks of starting OPSUMIT, some requiring intervention with a diuretic or hospitalization for decompensated heart failure, have been reported [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Monitor for signs of fluid retention after OPSUMIT initiation. If clinically significant fluid retention develops, evaluate the patient to determine the cause, such as OPSUMIT or underlying heart failure, and the possible need to discontinue OPSUMIT. 5.5 Hemoglobin Decrease Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have occurred following administration of other ERAs and were observed in clinical studies with OPSUMIT. These decreases occurred early and stabilized thereafter. In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, OPSUMIT 10 mg caused a mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to up to 18 months of about 1.0 g/dL compared to no change in the placebo group. A decrease in hemoglobin to below 10.0 g/dL was reported in 8.7% of the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and in 3.4% of the placebo group. Decreases in hemoglobin seldom require transfusion. Initiation of OPSUMIT is not recommended in patients with severe anemia. Measure hemoglobin prior to initiation of treatment and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.6 Pulmonary Edema with Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease (PVOD) Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue OPSUMIT. 5.7 Decreased Sperm Counts OPSUMIT, like other ERAs, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis. Counsel men about potential effects on fertility [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include: Embryo-fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Fluid Retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Decrease in Hemoglobin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most common adverse reactions (more frequent than placebo by ≥3%) are anemia, nasopharyngitis/pharyngitis, bronchitis, headache, influenza, and urinary tract infection ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actelion at 1-800-526-7736 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Safety data for OPSUMIT were obtained primarily from one placebo-controlled clinical study in 742 patients with PAH (SERAPHIN study) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The exposure to OPSUMIT in this trial was up to 3.6 years with a median exposure of about 2 years (N=542 for 1 year; N=429 for 2 years; and N=98 for more than 3 years). The overall incidence of treatment discontinuations because of adverse events was similar across OPSUMIT 10 mg and placebo treatment groups (approximately 11%). Table 2 presents adverse reactions more frequent on OPSUMIT than on placebo by ≥3%. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction OPSUMIT 10 mg (N=242) (%) Placebo (N=249) (%) Anemia 13 3 Nasopharyngitis/pharyngitis 20 13 Bronchitis 12 6 Headache 14 9 Influenza 6 2 Urinary tract infection 9 6 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of OPSUMIT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, pruritus and rash) Vascular disorders : flushing Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: nasal congestion Gastrointestinal disorders: Elevations of liver aminotransferases (ALT, AST) and liver injury have been reported with OPSUMIT use; in most cases alternative causes could be identified (heart failure, hepatic congestion, autoimmune hepatitis). Endothelin receptor antagonists have been associated with elevations of aminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and cases of liver failure [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] General disorders and administration site conditions: edema/fluid retention. Cases of edema and fluid retention occurred within weeks of starting OPSUMIT, some requiring intervention with a diuretic, fluid management or hospitalization for decompensated heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Cardiac disorders: symptomatic hypotension"
