Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, urticaria The most common adverse reactions reported are anaphylaxis and urticaria.
