    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Sulfonamides are known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome in hypersensitive individuals. Stevens-Johnson syndrome also has been reported following the use of sodium sulfacetamide topically. Cases of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus from topical sulfacetamide also have been reported. In one of these cases, there was a fatal outcome. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN.PRECAUTIONS FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE. Avoid contact with eyes, lips and mucous membranes. General Nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi, may proliferate with the use of this preparation. Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. If the use of this product produces signs of hypersensitivity or other untoward reactions, discontinued use of the preparation. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. Systemic toxic reactions such as granulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice, and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved. Systemic absorption of topical sulfonamides is greater following application to large, infected, abraded, denuded or severely burned areas.  Under these circumstances, any of the adverse effects produced by the systemic administration of these agents could potentially occur, and appropriate observations and laboratory determinations should be performed. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility. Information for Patients Patients should discontinue the use of this product if the condition becomes worse or if a rash develops in the area being treated or elsewhere. The use of this product also should be discontinued promptly and the physician notiﬁed if any arthritis, fever or sores in the mouth develop. Avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, lips and mucous membranes. Drug Interactions This product is incompatible with silver preparations. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies for carcinogenic potential have not been performed on this product to date. Studies on reproduction and fertility also have not been performed. Chromosomal nondisjunction has been reported in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, following application of sodium sulfacetamide. The signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding to the topical use of sodium sulfacetamide in the human is unknown. Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can affect reproduction capacity or cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. This product should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed or when potential beneﬁts outweigh potential hazards to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in the human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this product is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children under the age of 12 have not been established."
