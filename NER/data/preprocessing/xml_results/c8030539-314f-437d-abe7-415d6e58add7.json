    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of infections in adults and pediatric patients, due to susceptible isolates of the designated bacteria in the conditions listed below: • Lower Respiratory Tract Infections - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis . • Acute Bacterial Otitis Media - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis . • Sinusitis - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis . • Skin and Skin Structure Infections - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species . • Urinary Tract Infections - caused by beta‑lactamase‑producing isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella species , and Enterobacter species. Limitations of Use When susceptibility test results show susceptibility to amoxicillin, indicating no beta-lactamase production, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should not be used. Usage To reduce the development of drug‑resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets are a combination of amoxicillin, a penicillin-class antibacterial and clavulanate potassium, a beta-lactamase inhibitor indicated for treatment of the following infections in adults and pediatric patients: ( 1 ) • Lower respiratory tract infections • Acute bacterial otitis media • Sinusitis • Skin and skin structure infections • Urinary tract infections Limitations of Use When susceptibility test results show susceptibility to amoxicillin, indicating no beta-lactamase production, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should not be used. ( 1 ) Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious (including fatal) hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium if a reaction occurs. ( 5.1 ) • Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCAR): Monitor closely. Discontinue if rash progresses. ( 5.2 ) • Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) has been reported with use of amoxicillin, a component of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets. If this occurs, discontinue amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium and institute appropriate therapy. (5.3) • Hepatic dysfunction and cholestatic jaundice: Discontinue if signs/symptoms of hepatitis occur. Monitor liver function tests in patients with hepatic impairment. (5.4) • Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD): Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) • Patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium develop skin rash. Avoid amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium use in these patients. ( 5.6 ) • Overgrowth: The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterials, including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash, they should be monitored closely, and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium discontinued if lesions progress. 5.3 Drug-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (DIES) Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) has been reported with use of amoxicillin, a component of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablets [see with most cases occurring in pediatric patients ≤ 18 years of age. DIES is a non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction characterized by protracted vomiting occurring 1 Adverse Reactions (6.2) ], to 4 hours after drug ingestion in the absence of skin or respiratory symptoms. DIES may be associated with pallor, lethargy, hypotension, shock, diarrhea within 24 hours of ingesting amoxicillin, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. If DIES occurs, discontinue amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium and institute appropriate therapy. 5.4 Hepatic Dysfunction Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. 5.5 Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.6 Skin Rash in Patients with Mononucleosis A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. 5.7 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfection occurs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: • Anaphylactic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Drug-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (DIES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] • Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] • Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%). Less than 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse reactions. The overall incidence of adverse reactions, and in particular diarrhea, increased with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported adverse reactions (less than 1%) include: Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache. In pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years), 1 U.S./Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared 45/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided every 12 hours) of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for 10 days versus 40/10 mg/kg/day (divided every 8 hours) of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. A total of 575 patients were enrolled, and only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. Overall, the adverse reactions seen were comparable to that noted above; however, there were differences in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes [see . Clinical Studies (14.2) ] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during postmarketing use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. Gastrointestinal: Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES), indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black “hairy” tongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock), angioedema, serum sickness-like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), hypersensitivity vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Skin and Appendages: Rashes, pruritus, urticaria, erythema multiforme, SJS, TEN, DRESS, AGEP, exfoliative dermatitis, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis. Liver: Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT), serum bilirubin, and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been reported with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly, in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed cholestatic hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued. The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. Deaths have been reported [see Contraindications (4.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Renal: Interstitial nephritis, hematuria, and crystalluria have been reported [see . Overdosage (10) ] Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Thrombocytosis was noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients receiving amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium and anticoagulant therapy concomitantly [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, behavioral changes, aseptic meningitis, confusion, convulsions, dizziness, insomnia, and reversible hyperactivity have been reported. Miscellaneous: Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases."
