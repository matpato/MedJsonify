    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS EXCESSIVE DOSAGE, OR SHORT INTERVALS BETWEEN DOSES, CAN RESULT IN HIGH PLASMA LEVELS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INSTRUCTED TO STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES AS SET FORTH IN THIS PACKAGE INSERT. THE MANAGEMENT OF SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF RESUSCITATIVE EQUIPMENT, OXYGEN AND OTHER RESUSCITATIVE DRUGS. Lidocaine HCl 2% Jelly should be used with extreme caution in the presence of sepsis or severely traumatized mucosa in the area of application, since under such conditions there is the potential for rapid systemic absorption. When used for endotracheal tube lubrication care should be taken to avoid introducing the product into the lumen of the tube. Do not use the jelly to lubricate the endotracheal stylettes. If allowed into the inner lumen, the jelly may dry on the inner surface leaving a residue which tends to clump with flexion, narrowing the lumen. There have been rare reports in which this residue has caused the lumen to occlude (see and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue Lidocaine HCl 2% Jelly and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen.PRECAUTIONS The safety and effectiveness of lidocaine depend on proper dosage, correct technique, adequate precautions, and readiness for emergencies (see General: and WARNINGS ). The lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia should be used to avoid high plasma levels and serious adverse effects. Repeated doses of lidocaine may cause significant increases in blood levels with each repeated dose because of slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites. Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient. Debilitated, elderly patients, acutely ill patients, and children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status. Lidocaine should also be used with caution in patients with severe shock or heart block. ADVERSE REACTIONS Lidocaine HCl 2% Jelly should be used with caution in patients with known drug sensitivities. Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. Many drugs used during the conduct of anesthesia are considered potential triggering agents for familial malignant hyperthermia. Since it is not known whether amide-type local anesthetics may trigger this reaction and since the need for supplemental general anesthesia cannot be predicted in advance, it is suggested that a standard protocol for management should be available. Early unexplained signs of tachycardia, tachypnea, labile blood pressure, and metabolic acidosis may precede temperature elevation. Successful outcome is dependent on early diagnosis, prompt discontinuance of the suspect triggering agent(s) and institution of treatment, including oxygen therapy, indicated supportive measures and dantrolene (consult dantrolene sodium intravenous package insert before using). Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue. Information for Patients: When topical anesthetics are used in the mouth, the patient should be aware that the production of topical anesthesia may impair swallowing and thus enhance the danger of aspiration. For this reason, food should not be ingested for 60 minutes following use of local anesthetic preparations in the mouth or throat area. This is particularly important in children because of their frequency of eating. Numbness of the tongue or buccal mucosa may enhance the danger of unintentional biting trauma. Food or chewing gum should not be taken while the mouth or throat area is anesthetized. Drug Interactions Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics: Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitric oxide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, tetracaine Antineoplastics Agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid, sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants Phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, quinine, sulfasalazine - Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of lidocaine. Carcinogenesis - The mutagenic potential of lidocaine has been tested in the Ames Salmonella reverse mutation assay, and an Mutagenesis in vitro chromosome aberrations assay in human lymphocytes and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. There was no indication of any mutagenic effect in these studies. - The effect of lidocaine on fertility was examined in the rat model. Administration of 30 mg/kg, s.c. (180 mg/m Impairment of Fertility 2 ) to the mating pair did not produce alterations in fertility or general reproductive performance of rats. There are no studies that examine the effect of lidocaine on sperm parameters. There was no evidence of altered fertility. Use in Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Reproduction studies for lidocaine have been performed in both rats and rabbits. There was no evidence of harm to the fetus at subcutaneous doses of up to 50 mg/kg lidocaine (300 mg/m 2 on a body surface area basis) in the rat model. In the rabbit model, there was no evidence of harm to the fetus at a dose of 5 mg/kg, s.c. (60 mg/m 2 on a body surface area basis). Treatment of rabbits with 25 mg/kg (300 mg/m 2 ) produced evidence of maternal toxicity and evidence of delayed fetal development, including a non-significant decrease in fetal weight (7%) and an increase in minor skeletal anomalies (skull and sternebral defect, reduced ossification of the phalanges). The effect of lidocaine on post-natal development was examined in rats by treating pregnant female rats daily subcutaneously at doses of 2, 10, and 50 mg/kg (12, 60, and 300 mg/m 2 ) from day 15 of pregnancy and up to 20 days post partum. No signs of adverse effects were seen either in dams or in the pups up to and including the dose of 10 mg/kg (60 mg/m 2 ); however, the number of surviving pups was reduced at 50 mg/kg (300 mg/m 2 ), both at birth and the duration of lactation period, the effect most likely being secondary to maternal toxicity. No other effects on litter size, litter weight, abnormalities in the pups and physical developments of the pups were seen in this study. A second study examined the effects of lidocaine on post-natal development in the rat that included assessment of the pups from weaning to sexual maturity. Rats were treated for 8 months with 10 or 30 mg/kg, s.c. lidocaine (60 mg/m 2 and 180 mg/m 2 on a body surface area basis, respectively). This time period encompassed 3 mating periods. There was no evidence of altered post-natal development in any offspring; however, both doses of lidocaine significantly reduced the average number of pups per litter surviving until weaning of offspring from the first 2 mating period. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should Lidocaine HCl 2% Jelly be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, the total dose contributed by all formulations must be kept in mind. Labor and Delivery: Lidocaine is secreted in human milk. The clinical significance of this observation is unknown. Caution should be exercised when lidocaine is administered to a nursing woman. Nursing Mothers: Although the safety and effectiveness of Lidocaine 2% Jelly in pediatric patients have not been established, a study of 19 premature neonates (gestational age <33 weeks) found no correlation between the plasma concentration of lidocaine or monoethylglycinexylidide and infant body weight when moderate amounts of lidocaine (i.e. 0.3 mL/kg of lidocaine gel 20 mg/mL) were used for lubricating both intranasal and endotracheal tubes. No neonate had plasma levels of lidocaine above 750 mcg/L. Dosages in children should be reduced, commensurate with age, body weight, and physical condition (see Pediatric Use: ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse experiences following the administration of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed in other amide local anesthetic agents. These adverse experiences are, in general, dose-related and may result from high plasma levels caused by excessive dosage or rapid absorption, or may result from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy, or diminished tolerance on the part of the patient. Serious adverse experiences are generally systemic in nature. The following types are those most commonly reported: There have been rare reports of endotracheal tube occlusion associated with the presence of dried jelly residue in the inner lumen of the tube (see and WARNINGS ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION CNS manifestations are excitatory and/or depressant and may be characterized by light headedness: nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and arrest. The excitatory manifestations may be very brief or may not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation of toxicity may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness and respiratory arrest. Central Nervous System: Drowsiness following the administration of lidocaine is usually an early sign of a high blood level of the drug and may occur as a consequence of rapid absorption. Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse which may lead to cardiac arrest. Cardiovascular System: Allergic reactions are characterized by cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema, or anaphylactoid reactions. Allergic reactions may occur as a result of sensitivity either to the local anesthetic agent or other components in the formulation. Allergic reactions as a result of sensitivity to lidocaine are extremely rare and, if they occur, should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Allergic: To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sentiss at 1-855-473-6847 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."
