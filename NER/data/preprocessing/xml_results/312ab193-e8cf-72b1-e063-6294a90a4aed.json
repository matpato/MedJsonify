  "indications": "INDICATIONS & USAGE Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules ( loperamide hydrochloride ) is indicated for the control and symptomatic relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea in patients 2 years of age and older and of chronic diarrhea in adults associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules is also indicated for reducing the volume of discharge from ileostomies.",
  "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in: pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions ( see WARNINGS ) . patients with a known hypersensitivity to loperamide hydrochloride or to any of the excipients. patients with abdominal pain in the absence of diarrhea. patients with acute dysentery, which is characterized by blood in stools and high fever. patients with acute ulcerative colitis. patients with bacterial enterocolitis caused by invasive organisms including Salmonella , Shigella , and Campylobacter . patients with pseudomembranous colitis ( e.g. , Clostridium difficle ) associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Cardiac Adverse Reactions, Including Torsades de Pointes and Sudden Death Cases of prolongation of the QT/QTc interval, Torsades de Pointes, other ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, some resulting in death, have been reported in adults with use of higher than recommended doses per day of Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules Cases include patients who were abusing or misusing loperamide hydrochloride ( see OVERDOSAGE and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Cases of syncope and ventricular tachycardia have been reported in adult patients receiving the recommended dosage of Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules. Some of these patients were taking other drugs or had other risk factors that may have increased their risk of cardiac adverse reactions. Additionally, postmarketing cases of cardiac arrest, syncope, and respiratory depression have been reported in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions. Avoid Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules dosages higher than recommended in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older due to the risk of serious cardiac adverse reactions ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, OVERDOSAGE ) Avoid Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules in: combination with others drugs or herbal products that are known to prolong the QT interval, including Class 1 A ( e.g. , quinidine, procainamide ) or Class III ( e.g. , amiodarone, sotalol ) antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics ( e.g. , chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone ) , antibiotics ( e.g. , moxifloxacin ) , or any other drug known to prolong the QT interval ( e.g. , pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone ) patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, including patients with congenital long QT syndrome, with a history of cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions, elderly patients and those with electrolyte abnormalities. Dehydration Fluid and electrolyte depletion often occur in patients who have diarrhea. In such cases, administration of appropriate fluid and electrolytes is very important. The use of Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules does not preclude the need for appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy. Gastrointestinal Disorders In general, Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules should not be used when inhibition of peristalsis is to be avoided due to the possible risk of significant sequelae including ileus, megacolon and toxic megacolon. Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules must be discontinued promptly when constipation, abdominal distention or ileus develop. Treatment of diarrhea with Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules is only symptomatic. Whenever an underlying etiology can be determined, specific treatment should be given when appropriate ( or when indicated ) . Patients with AIDS treated with Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules, 2 mg for diarrhea should have therapy stopped at the earliest signs of abdominal distention. There have been isolated reports of toxic megacolon in AIDS patients with infectious colitis from both viral and bacterial pathogens treated with loperamide hydrochloride. Variability in Pediatric Response Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules should be used with special caution in pediatric patients because of the greater variability of response in this age group. Dehydration, particularly in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age, may further influence the variability of response to Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules. Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions.PRECAUTIONS GENERAL PRECAUTIONS Allergic Reactions Extremely rare allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported. Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of loperamide have not been studied. Use Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules with caution in such patients because the systemic exposure to loperamide may be increased due to reduced metabolism. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment closely for signs of central nervous system ( CNS ) toxicity. Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since it has been reported that the majority of the drug is metabolized and metabolites or the unchanged drug are excreted mainly in the feces, dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment are not required. Geriatric Use No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of loperamide in elderly subjects. However, in two studies that enrolled elderly patients, there were no major differences in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Avoid Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules in elderly patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval ( for example, Class IA or III antiarrhythmics ) or in patients with risk factors for Torsades de Pointes ( see WARNINGS ) . INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Advise patients: to take Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage is not recommended ( see WARNINGS ) . Report to a healthcare facility if you or someone you are caring for taking Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules experiences fainting episode, a rapid or irregular heartbeat or become unresponsive. with acute diarrhea, that if clinical improvement is not observed in 48 hours, discontinue Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules and contact their healthcare provider. to contact their healthcare provider if they see blood in their stools, or if they develop a fever or abdominal distention. to use caution when driving a car or operating machinery, as tiredness, dizziness, or drowsiness may occur in the setting of diarrheal syndromes treated with Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules. ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) to tell their healthcare provider about all the medications they are taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, vitamins and herbal supplements, especially if they take Class 1 A ( e.g. , quinidine, procainamide ) or Class III ( e.g. , amiodarone, sotalol ) antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics ( e.g. , chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone ) , antibiotics ( e.g. , moxifloxacin ) , or any other drug known to prolong the QT interval ( e.g. , pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone ) . Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 ( 724 ) 465-8762 DRUG INTERACTIONS Effects of Other Drugs on Loperamide Concomitant use of Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules with inhibitors of CYP3 A4 ( e.g. , itraconazole ) or CYP2 C8 ( e.g. , gemfibrozil ) or inhibitors of P-glycoprotein ( e.g. , quinidine, ritonavir ) can increase exposure to loperamide. The increased systemic exposure to loperamide may increase a risk for cardiac adverse reactions especially in patients who are taking multiple CYP enzyme inhibitors, or in patients with underlying cardiac conditions ( see WARNINGS ) . Monitor patients for cardiac adverse reactions. CYP3 A4 Inhibitors Itraconazole Concomitant administration of multiple doses of 100 mg itraconazole twice daily, an inhibitor of both CYP3 A4 and P-glycoprotein, with a single 4-mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride increased the peak plasma concentration and the systemic exposure to loperamide by 2.9-fold and 3.8-fold, respectively. CYP2 C8 Inhibitors Gemfibrozil When a single 4-mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride was co-administered with 600 mg gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2 C8, on day 3 of a 5-day treatment with gemfibrozil twice daily, the mean peak plasma concentration and the systemic exposure to loperamide was increased by 1.6-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively. CYP3 A4 and CYP2 C8 Inhibitors When multiple doses of both 100 mg itraconazole and 600 mg gemfibrozil twice daily were administered with a single 4-mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride, the mean peak plasma concentration and the systemic exposure to loperamide was increased by 4.2-fold and 12.6-fold, respectively. P-glycoprotein Inhibitors Concomitant administration of a 16 mg single dose of loperamide hydrochloride with a 600 mg single dose of quinidine or ritonavir, both of which are P-glycoprotein inhibitors, resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in loperamide plasma concentrations. Due to the potential for enhanced CNS adverse reactions when loperamide is co-administered with quinidine and with ritonavir, caution should be exercised when Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules USP, 2 mg is administered at the recommended dosages ( 2 mg, up to 16 mg maximum daily dose ) with P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Effects of Loperamide on Other Drugs Saquinavir When a single 16-mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride is coadministered with a 600 mg single dose of saquinavir, loperamide decreased saquinavir exposure by 54% , which may be of clinical relevance due to reduction of therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir. The effect of saquinavir on loperamide is of less clinical significance. Therefore, when Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules is given with saquinavir, the therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir should be closely monitored. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY In an 18-month rat study with oral loperamide hydrochloride doses up to 40 mg/kg/day ( 21 times the maximum human dose of 16 mg/day, based on a body surface area comparison ) , there was no evidence of carcinogenesis. Loperamide was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the SOS chromotest in E. coli, the dominant lethal test in female mice, or the mouse embryo cell transformation assay. Fertility and reproductive performance was evaluated in rats using oral doses of 2.5, 10, and 40 mg/kg/day ( females only ) in a second study. Oral administration of 20 mg/kg/day ( approximately 11 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison ) and higher, produced a strong impairment of female fertility. Treatment of female rats with up to 10 mg/kg/day ( approximately 5 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison ) had no effect on fertility. Treatment of male rats with oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day ( approximately 21 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison ) produced impairment of male fertility, whereas administration of up to 10 mg/kg/day ( approximately 5 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison ) had no effect. PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects Teratology studies have been performed in rats using oral loperamide hydrochloride doses of 2.5, 10, and 40 mg/kg/day, and in rabbits using oral doses of 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day. These studies have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day in rats ( 5 times the human dose based on body surface area comparison ) and 40 mg/kg/day in rabbits ( 43 times the human dose based on body surface area comparison ) . Treatment of rats with oral doses of 40 mg/kg/day ( 21 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison ) produced marked impairment of fertility. The studies produced no evidence of teratogenic activity. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects In a peri- and post-natal development study in rats, oral administration of 40 mg/kg/day produced impairment of growth and survival of offspring. NURSING MOTHERS Small amounts of loperamide may appear in human breast milk. Therefore, Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules is not recommended during breast-feeding. PEDIATRIC USE Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules, 2 mg is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) . Postmarketing cases of cardiac arrest, syncope, and respiratory depression have been reported in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age ( see WARNINGS ) . Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to CNS effects, such as altered mental status, somnolence, and respiratory depression, than adults. There have been rare reports of paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with pediatric patients less than two years of age. Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules should be used with special caution in pediatric patients because of their greater variability of response ( see WARNINGS ) . Dehydration, particularly in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age, may further influence the variability of response to Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules The safety and effectiveness of Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules in pediatric patients with chronic diarrhea have not been established. Although Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules has been studied in a limited number of pediatric patients with chronic diarrhea; the therapeutic dose for the treatment of chronic diarrhea in a pediatric population has not been established. In case of accidental overdosage of Loperamide Hydrochloride Capsules by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE for suggested treatment.",
