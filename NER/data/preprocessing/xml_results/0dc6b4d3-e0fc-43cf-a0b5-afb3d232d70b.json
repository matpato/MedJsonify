    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ZEVTERA is a cephalosporin antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia) (SAB), including those with right-sided infective endocarditis ( 1.1 ), Adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) ( 1.2 ), and Adult and pediatric patients (3 months to less than 18 years old) with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) ( 1.3 ). To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZEVTERA and other antibacterial drugs, ZEVTERA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria ( 1.4 ). 1.1 Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infection (Bacteremia) ZEVTERA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (bacteremia) (SAB), including those with right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates . 1.2  Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections ZEVTERA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of the following gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 1.3  Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia ZEVTERA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (3 months to less than 18 years old) with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) caused by susceptible isolates of the following gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus parainfluenzae , Escherichia coli , and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 1.4  Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZEVTERA and other antibacterial drugs, ZEVTERA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven, or strongly suspected, to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ZEVTERA is contraindicated in patients with a known history of severe hypersensitivity to ZEVTERA, or to other members of the cephalosporin class [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. ZEVTERA is contraindicated in patients with a known history of severe hypersensitivity to ZEVTERA, or to other members of the cephalosporin class ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Mortality with Unapproved use in Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia (VABP) Patients: The safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of VABP has not been established and the use of ZEVTERA for VABP is not approved ( 5.1 ). Hypersensitivity Reactions: Discontinue ZEVTERA if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, and institute appropriate treatment ( 5.2 ). Seizures and other adverse central nervous system (CNS) reactions have been associated with the use of ZEVTERA. If seizures or other CNS adverse reactions occur, evaluate patients to determine whether ZEVTERA should be discontinued ( 5.3 ). Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZEVTERA. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs ( 5.4 ). 5.1 Increased Mortality with Unapproved Use in Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia Patients In Trial 4, an increase in mortality was seen in the subgroup of patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) who were treated with ZEVTERA (35/103 [34%] versus 24/102 [24%] in comparator-treated patients) [see . The cause of this increased mortality has not been established. Generally, deaths were associated with complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. The safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of VABP has not been established and the use of ZEVTERA for VABP is not approved. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.2  Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, were observed in ZEVTERA-treated patients in clinical trials [see . Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Before therapy with ZEVTERA is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs should be made. Maintain clinical supervision if this product is to be given to a penicillin- or other beta-lactam-allergic patient, because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial agents has been established. Discontinue ZEVTERA if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, and institute appropriate treatment. 5.3  Seizures and Other Central Nervous System Reactions Seizures and other adverse central nervous system (CNS) reactions have been reported during treatment with ZEVTERA and other cephalosporins [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported with cephalopsorins particularly in patients with a history of epilepsy or when recommended dosages of cephalosporins were exceeded due to renal impairment. Adjust ZEVTERA dosing based on creatinine clearance [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) ] Anticonvulsant therapy should be continued in patients with known seizure disorders. If CNS adverse reactions, including seizures, occur, patients should undergo a neurological evaluation to determine whether ZEVTERA should be discontinued. 5.4 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including ZEVTERA, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued, if possible. Manage fluid and electrolyte levels as appropriate, supplement protein intake, monitor antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. 5.5  Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing ZEVTERA in the absence of a proven or strongly-suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",

Overview of the Safety Evaluation of ZEVTERA ZEVTERA was evaluated in four controlled comparative phase 3 clinical trials (TRIALS 1 through 4) which included 1221 adult patients treated with ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) administered by IV infusion over 2 hours every 6 to 8 hours and 1248 patients treated with comparator for a treatment period up to 42 days. The median age of patients treated with ZEVTERA was 56 years, ranging between 18 and 95 years old. Patients treated with ZEVTERA were predominantly male (64%) and White (82%). ZEVTERA was also evaluated in a controlled phase 3 clinical trial (TRIAL 5) which included 138 pediatric patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with CABP and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) requiring hospitalization. Although HABP was included in the safety data, the safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of HABP has not been established and ZEVTERA is not approved for the treatment of HABP. Adult Patients Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients with Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infection (Bacteremia) ZEVTERA was evaluated in an active-controlled randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 trial (TRIAL 1) in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (bacteremia) (SAB) including right-sided infective endocarditis. In TRIAL 1, 191 patients received ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) administered as a 2-hour IV infusion every 6 hours from Day 1 to Day 8, and ZEVTERA 667 mg every 8 hours from Day 9 onwards, and 198 patients were treated with a comparator (daptomycin administered as an IV 0.5 hour infusion, 6 mg/kg up to 10 mg/kg every 24 hours, with optional aztreonam). The dose of study drugs were adjusted based on renal function. The median age of patients treated with ZEVTERA was 57 years, ranging between 20-89 years old with approximately 30% aged greater than or equal to 65 years. Patients treated with ZEVTERA were predominantly male (68%), White (95%), and from Europe (93%).  The median duration of treatment was 21 days in both treatment arms. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In TRIAL 1, a total of 36/191 (18.8%) patients with SAB treated with ZEVTERA and 45/198 (22.7%) of patients with SAB treated with daptomycin ± aztreonam experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reaction occurred in 18/191 (9.4%) of patients treated with ZEVTERA, and 18/198 (9.1%) of patients treated with daptomycin ± aztreonam. In patients treated with ZEVTERA, the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea, vomiting, rash, and urticaria, each occurring in 2/191 (1%). Deaths occurred in 17/191 (8.9%) patients treated with ZEVTERA and 18/198 (9.1%) patients treated with daptomycin ± aztreonam.

Although HABP/VABP are included in the safety data, the safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of HABP/VABP have not been established and ZEVTERA is not approved for HABP or VABP. In TRIAL 4, 386 patients received ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) every 8 hours as a 2-hour IV infusion, and 386 patients were treated with ceftazidime 2 grams every 8 hours as a 2-hour IV infusion with or without linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours as a 1-hr infusion. The dose of ZEVTERA and ceftazidime were adjusted based on renal function. The median age of patients treated with ZEVTERA was 62.5 years (range 18 - 95) with approximately 47% aged 65 years or older. Approximately 81% of the patients were White, most were outside of the United States  (88%) and 72% were male. Patients across treatment arms received treatment for a median duration of 8 days. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Adult Patients In TRIAL 4, a total of 140/386 (36.3%) HABP/VABP patients treated with ZEVTERA and 123/386 (31.9%) HABP/VABP patients treated with ceftazidime ± linezolid experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reaction occurred in 54/386 (14%) of patients treated with ZEVTERA, and 40/386 (10.4%) of patients treated with ceftazidime ± linezolid. Deaths occurred in 88/386 patients (22.8%) treated with ZEVTERA and 84/386 patients (21.8%) treated with ceftazidime ± linezolid. In the subgroup of patients with VABP, 35/103 patients treated with ZEVTERA died (34.0%) versus 24/102 (23.5%) of the patients treated with ceftazidime ± linezolid. In the subgroup of patients with HABP, 53/283 patients treated with ZEVTERA died (18.7%) versus 60/284 patients treated with ceftazidime ± linezolid (21.1%). Common Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients Common adverse reactions occurring in >2% of HABP/VABP patients who received ceftobiprole in TRIAL 4 include diarrhea, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hepatic enzyme increased, vomiting, anemia, rash, phlebitis, nausea, abdominal pain, and seizures. Selected Adverse Reactions of ZEVTERA in Adult Patients The following selected adverse reactions were reported in ZEVTERA-treated adult patients at a rate of less than 2% in Trials 1, 2, 3 and 4. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombocytosis, Thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal disorders: Dyspepsia, Dysphagia General disorders and administration site conditions: Fatigue, Chills, Facial swelling, Infusion site pain Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity, Angioedema, Anaphylactic shock Infections and infestations: Mucocutaneous fungal infections Investigations: Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, Blood triglycerides increased, Prothrombin time prolonged Psychiatric disorders: Anxiety, Irritability, Renal and urinary disorders: Pollakiuria Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Bronchospasm, Wheezing Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Pruritus Vascular disorders: Thrombosis Pediatric Patients Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia ZEVTERA was evaluated in an active-controlled, randomized, investigator-blind, multicenter phase 3 study in pediatric patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with HABP or CABP requiring hospitalization. Although patients with HABP are included in the safety data, the safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of HABP has not been established and ZEVTERA is not approved for HABP. In TRIAL 5, 94 patients received ZEVTERA 13.3 mg/kg (equivalent to 10 mg/kg of ceftobiprole) to 26.7 mg/kg (equivalent to 20 mg/kg of ceftobiprole – higher than the recommended approved dose) [see ZEVTERA was administered by intravenous infusion every 8 hours, age-adjusted for dose and infusion duration (2-hour or 4-hour infusion). In the comparator arm, 44 patients received either ceftriaxone 50-80 mg/kg IV as a single daily dose (maximum 2 grams/day) for CABP or ceftazidime 50 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (maximum 6 grams/day) for HABP, with or without vancomycin 10-15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours (maximum 2 grams/day). The median age of study patients was 5 years, ranging from 0.6 to 17 years. All patients were from Europe, 100% were classified as White and 56% of patients were male. Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.4) ]. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Pediatric Patients In TRIAL 5, a total of 7/94 (7.4%) pediatric patients treated with ZEVTERA and 2/44 (4.5%) patients in the comparator group experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reaction occurred in 4/94 (4.3%) of patients treated with ZEVTERA and 0/44 patients treated in the comparator group. Specific adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in patients who received ZEVTERA included aggravated pneumonia, pleuritis, urticaria, and hypersensitivity, each occurring in 1/94 (1.1%). There were no deaths in either arm of the pediatric study. The most common selected adverse reactions, occurring in ≥ 2% of pediatric patients treated with ceftobiprole, were vomiting (7.4%) headache (3.2%), hepatic enzyme increased (including alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased) (3.2%), diarrhea, infusion site reaction, phlebitis, and pyrexia (all 2.1%). 6.2  Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been identified during post-approval use of ZEVTERA and ceftobiprole outside of the United States, or other cephalosporin-class antibacterial drugs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Altered Laboratory Tests : Positive direct Coombs' test, false-positive test for urinary glucose. Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia. Hepatobiliary disorders : Hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis Immune system disorders : Drug fever, serum sickness-like reaction Nervous system disorders : Myoclonus Renal and urinary disorders : Renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy Vascular disorders : Hemorrhage, hypertension"
