    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Schedule-Dependent Toxicity: Increased toxicity with infusion time greater than 60 minutes or dosing more frequently than once weekly. ( 5.1 ) Myelosuppression: Monitor for myelosuppression prior to each cycle and reduce or withhold dose for severe myelosuppression. ( 5.2 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) Permanently discontinue gemcitabine injection if SCARs occur. ( 5.3 ) Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure: Discontinue gemcitabine injection for unexplained dyspnea or other evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. ( 5.4 ) Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Monitor renal function prior to initiation and during treatment. Discontinue gemcitabine for HUS or severe renal impairment. ( 5.5 ) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function prior to initiation and during treatment. Discontinue gemcitabine for severe hepatic toxicity. ( 5.6 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 , 8.1 ) Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity: May cause severe and life-threatening toxicity when administered during or within 7 days of radiation therapy. ( 5.8 ) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Discontinue gemcitabine. ( 5.9 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): Discontinue gemcitabine. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Schedule-Dependent Toxicity In clinical trials evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine, prolongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes or more frequent than weekly dosing resulted in an increased incidence of clinically significant hypotension, severe flu-like symptoms, myelosuppression, and asthenia. The half-life of gemcitabine is influenced by the length of the infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Refer to the recommended gemcitabine dosage 12.3 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 )] 5.2 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, occurs with gemcitabine as a single agent and the risks are increased when gemcitabine is combined with other cytotoxic drugs. In clinical trials, Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 25%, 8%, and 5%, respectively of the 979 patients who received single agent gemcitabine. The frequencies of Grade 3-4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia varied from 48% to 71%, 8% to 28%, and 5% to 55%, respectively, in patients receiving gemcitabine in combination with another drug [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Prior to each dose of gemcitabine, obtain a complete blood count (CBC) with a differential and a platelet count. Modify the dosage as recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 )] 5.3 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) SCARs, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported in association with gemcitabine treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( . Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Permanently discontinue gemcitabine in patients who develop SCARs. 6.2 )] 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity and Respiratory Failure Pulmonary toxicity, including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has been reported. In some cases, these pulmonary events can lead to fatal respiratory failure despite the discontinuation of therapy. The onset of pulmonary symptoms may occur up to 2 weeks after the last dose of gemcitabine [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 , 6.2 )] Permanently discontinue gemcitabine in patients who develop unexplained dyspnea, with or without bronchospasm, or evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity. 5.5 Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), including fatalities from renal failure or the requirement for dialysis, can occur with gemcitabine. In clinical trials, HUS occurred in 0.25%  of 2,429 patients. Most fatal cases of renal failure were due to HUS [see Adverse Reactions ( Serious cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) other than HUS have been reported with gemcitabine 6.1 )]. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Assess renal function prior to initiation of gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Consider the diagnosis of HUS in patients who develop anemia with evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis; increased bilirubin or LDH; reticulocytosis; severe thrombocytopenia; or evidence of renal failure (increased serum creatinine or BUN). Permanently discontinue gemcitabine in patients with HUS or severe renal impairment. Renal failure may not be reversible even with the discontinuation of therapy. 5.6 Hepatic Toxicity Drug-induced liver injury, including liver failure and death, has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine alone or with other potentially hepatotoxic drugs [see Adverse Reactions ( Administration of gemcitabine in patients with concurrent liver metastases or a pre-existing medical history of hepatitis, alcoholism, or liver cirrhosis can lead to exacerbation of the underlying hepatic insufficiency. 6.1 , 6.2 )]. Assess hepatic function prior to initiation of gemcitabine and periodically during treatment. Permanently discontinue gemcitabine in patients who develop severe hepatic toxicity. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Gemcitabine was teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with gemcitabine and for 6 months after the final dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with gemcitabine and for 3 months following the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]. 5.8 Exacerbation of Radiation Therapy Toxicity Gemcitabine is not recommended for use in combination with radiation therapy. Concurrent (given together or ≤7 days apart) Life-threatening mucositis, especially esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in a trial in which gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg/m 2 to patients with non-small cell lung cancer for up to 6 consecutive weeks concurrently with thoracic radiation. Non-Concurrent (given >7 days apart) Excessive toxicity has not been observed when gemcitabine is administered more than 7 days before or after radiation. Radiation recall has been reported in patients who received gemcitabine after prior radiation. 5.9 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) with severe consequences has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents [see Adverse Reactions ( . Permanently discontinue gemcitabine if CLS develops during therapy. 6.2 )] 5.10 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in patients receiving gemcitabine as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents [see Adverse Reactions ( . PRES can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, hypertension, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Permanently discontinue gemcitabine if PRES develops during therapy. 6.2 )]",

Single Agent The data described below reflect exposure to gemcitabine as a single agent administered at doses between 800 mg/m 2 to 1,250 mg/m 2 intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly, in 979 patients with various malignancies. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions of single agent gemcitabine are nausea/vomiting, anemia, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), neutropenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, proteinuria, fever, hematuria, rash, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, and edema. The most common (≥5%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting, increased ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, anemia, increased AST, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of the 979 patients discontinued gemcitabine due to adverse reactions. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in 2% of 979 patients were cardiovascular adverse reactions (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, arrhythmia, and hypertension) and adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of gemcitabine in <1% of 979 patients were anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infection, stomatitis, somnolence, flu-like syndrome, and edema.

The following clinically relevant, Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred more frequently in the gemcitabine with carboplatin arm: dyspnea (3.4% versus 2.9%), febrile neutropenia (1.1% versus 0), hemorrhagic event (2.3% versus 1.1%), motor neuropathy (1.1% versus 0.6%), and rash/desquamation (0.6% versus 0). Breast Cancer Tables 9 and 10 present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, occurring in ≥10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine/paclitaxel arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 2) of gemcitabine with paclitaxel (n=262) compared to paclitaxel alone (n=259) for the first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in women who received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy in the adjuvant/neo-adjuvant setting or for whom anthracyclines were contraindicated [see Clinical Studies ( . Additional clinically significant adverse reactions, occurring in <10% of patients, are provided following 14.2 )] Table 10 . The requirement for dose reduction of paclitaxel were higher for patients in the gemcitabine/paclitaxel arm (5% versus 2%). The number of paclitaxel doses omitted (<1%), the proportion of patients discontinuing treatment for adverse reactions (7% versus 5%) and the number of treatment-related deaths (1 patient in each arm) were similar between the two arms.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Tables 11 and 12 present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, occurring in ≥10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 3) of gemcitabine with cisplatin (n=260) administered in 28-day cycles as compared to cisplatin alone (n=262) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.3 )] Patients randomized to gemcitabine with cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment. In this trial, the requirement for dose adjustments (>90% versus 16%), discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions (15% versus 8%), and the proportion of patients hospitalized (36% versus 23%) were all higher for patients receiving gemcitabine with cisplatin compared to those receiving cisplatin alone. The incidence of febrile neutropenia (3% versus <1%), sepsis (4% versus 1%), Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias (3% versus <1%) were all higher in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm. The two-drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 (1.5%) possibly treatment-related deaths, including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection. No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm.
