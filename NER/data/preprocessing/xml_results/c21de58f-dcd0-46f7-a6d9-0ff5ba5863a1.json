    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tigecycline is a tetracycline class antibacterial indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for: Complicated skin and skin structure infections (1.1) Complicated intra-abdominal infections (1.2) Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (1.3) Limitations of Use: Tigecycline for injection is not indicated for treatment of diabetic foot infection or hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia. (1.4) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tigecycline for injection and other antibacterial drugs, tigecycline for injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. (1.5) 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Tigecycline for injection is indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus grp. (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus ), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. 1.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections Tigecycline for injection is indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by susceptible isolates of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates), Streptococcus anginosus grp. (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. constellatus ), Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus micros. 1.3 Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Tigecycline for injection is indicated in patients 18 years of age and older for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates), including cases with concurrent bacteremia, Haemophilus influenzae , and Legionella pneumophila . 1.4 Limitations of Use Tigecycline for injection is not indicated for the treatment of diabetic foot infections. A clinical trial failed to demonstrate non-inferiority of tigecycline for treatment of diabetic foot infections. Tigecycline for injection is not indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia. In a comparative clinical trial, greater mortality and decreased efficacy were reported in tigecycline-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 1.5 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tigecycline for injection and other antibacterial drugs, tigecycline for injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Appropriate specimens for bacteriological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to tigecycline. Tigecycline for injection may be initiated as empiric monotherapy before results of these tests are known.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Tigecycline for injection is contraindicated for use in patients who have known hypersensitivity to tigecycline. Reactions have included anaphylactic reactions [see and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Known hypersensitivity to tigecycline. (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS All-Cause Mortality : A meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials demonstrated an increase in all-cause mortality in tigecycline-treated patients compared to controls with a risk difference of 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2). The cause of this increase has not been established. An increase was also seen in a meta-analysis limited to the approved indications [0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2)]. The greatest difference in mortality was seen in tigecycline-treated patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. (5.1 , 5.2) Anaphylactic Reactions : have been reported with tigecycline, and may be life-threatening. Avoid use in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines. (5.3) Hepatic Adverse Effects : have been reported with tigecycline. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. (5.4) Pancreatitis : including fatalities, has been reported with tigecycline. If pancreatitis is suspected, then consider stopping tigecycline. (5.5) Monitoring of Blood Coagulation Parameters: Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported with tigecycline for injection. Monitor blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, at baseline and regularly during treatment with tigecycline for injection. (5.6) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia : The use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia. (5.7) Inhibition of Bone Growth : The use of tigecycline for injection during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. (5.8) Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea (CDAD) : evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.9) 5.1 All-Cause Mortality An increase in all-cause mortality has been observed in a meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials in tigecycline-treated patients versus comparator-treated patients. In all 13 Phase 3 and 4 trials that included a comparator, death occurred in 4.0% (150/3788) of patients receiving tigecycline and 3.0% (110/3646) of patients receiving comparator drugs. In a pooled analysis of these trials, based on a random effects model by trial weight, the adjusted risk difference of all-cause mortality was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2) between tigecycline and comparator-treated patients. An analysis of mortality in all trials conducted for approved indications (cSSSI, cIAI, and CABP), including post-market trials showed an adjusted mortality rate of 2.5% (66/2640) for tigecycline and 1.8% (48/2628) for comparator, respectively. The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2). The cause of this mortality difference has not been established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. Tigecycline for injection should be reserved for use in situations when alternative treatments are not suitable [see and Boxed Warning , Indications and Usage (1.4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.2 Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia A trial of patients with hospital acquired, including ventilator-associated, pneumonia failed to demonstrate the efficacy of tigecycline. In this trial, patients were randomized to receive tigecycline (100 mg initially, then 50 mg every 12 hours) or a comparator. In addition, patients were allowed to receive specified adjunctive therapies. The sub-group of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who received tigecycline had lower cure rates (47.9% versus 70.1% for the clinically evaluable population). In this trial, greater mortality was seen in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who received tigecycline (25/131 [19.1%] versus 15/122 [12.3%] in comparator-treated patients) [see . Particularly high mortality was seen among tigecycline-treated patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia at baseline (9/18 [50.0%] versus 1/13 [7.7%] in comparator-treated patients). Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline, and may be life-threatening. Tigecycline is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. 5.4 Hepatic Adverse Effects Increases in total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time and transaminases have been seen in patients treated with tigecycline. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been reported in patients being treated with tigecycline. Some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline for injection therapy. Hepatic dysfunction may occur after the drug has been discontinued. 5.5 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal cases, has occurred in association with tigecycline treatment. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be considered in patients taking tigecycline for injection who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Cases have been reported in patients without known risk factors for pancreatitis. Patients usually improve after tigecycline discontinuation. Consideration should be given to the cessation of the treatment with tigecycline for injection in cases suspected of having developed pancreatitis [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.6 Monitoring of Blood Coagulation Parameters Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported in patients treated with tigecycline [see . Obtain baseline blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, and continue to monitor regularly during treatment with tigecycline. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.7 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of tetracyclines, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if tigecycline for injection is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.8 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of tigecycline for injection during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the tetracycline was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if tigecycline for injection is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.4) ]. 5.9 Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.10 Sepsis/Septic Shock in Patients With Intestinal Perforation Monotherapy with tigecycline for injection should be avoided in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) secondary to clinically apparent intestinal perforation. In cIAI studies (n=1642), 6 patients treated with tigecycline and 2 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin presented with intestinal perforations and developed sepsis/septic shock. The 6 patients treated with tigecycline had higher APACHE II scores (median = 13) versus the 2 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin (APACHE II scores = 4 and 6). Due to differences in baseline APACHE II scores between treatment groups and small overall numbers, the relationship of this outcome to treatment cannot be established. 5.11 Tetracycline-Class Adverse Effects Tigecycline for injection is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse effects. Such effects may include: photosensitivity, fixed drug eruption, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action (which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia). Discontinue tigecycline for injection if any of these adverse reactions are suspected. 5.12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing tigecycline for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",

In all 13 Phase 3 and 4 trials that included a comparator, death occurred in 4.0% (150/3788) of patients receiving tigecycline for injection and 3.0% (110/3646) of patients receiving comparator drugs. In a pooled analysis of these trials, based on a random effects model by trial weight, an adjusted risk difference of all-cause mortality was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2) between tigecycline for injection and comparator-treated patients (see Table 2). The cause of the imbalance has not been established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. Table 2.

Note: The studies include 300, 305, 900 (cSSSI), 301, 306, 315, 316, 400 (cIAI), 308 and 313 (CAP), 311 (HAP), 307 [Resistant gram-positive pathogen study in patients with MRSA or Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE)], and 319 (DFI with and without osteomyelitis). An analysis of mortality in all trials conducted for approved indications - cSSSI, cIAI, and CABP, including post-market trials (one in cSSSI and two in cIAI) - showed an adjusted mortality rate of 2.5% (66/2640) for tigecycline and 1.8% (48/2628) for comparator, respectively. The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2). In comparative clinical studies, infection-related serious adverse reactions were more frequently reported for subjects treated with tigecycline for injection (7%) versus comparators (6%). Serious adverse reactions of sepsis/septic shock were more frequently reported for subjects treated with tigecycline for injection (2%) versus comparators (1%). Due to baseline differences between treatment groups in this subset of patients, the relationship of this outcome to treatment cannot be established [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] The most common adverse reactions were nausea and vomiting which generally occurred during the first 1 – 2 days of therapy. The majority of cases of nausea and vomiting associated with tigecycline for injection and comparators were either mild or moderate in severity. In patients treated with tigecycline for injection, nausea incidence was 26% (17% mild, 8% moderate, 1% severe) and vomiting incidence was 18% (11% mild, 6% moderate, 1% severe). In patients treated for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), nausea incidence was 35% for tigecycline for injection and 9% for vancomycin/aztreonam; vomiting incidence was 20% for tigecycline for injection and 4% for vancomycin/aztreonam. In patients treated for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), nausea incidence was 25% for tigecycline for injection and 21% for imipenem/cilastatin; vomiting incidence was 20% for tigecycline for injection and 15% for imipenem/cilastatin. In patients treated for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), nausea incidence was 24% for tigecycline for injection and 8% for levofloxacin; vomiting incidence was 16% for tigecycline and 6% for levofloxacin. Discontinuation from tigecycline for injection was most frequently associated with nausea (1%) and vomiting (1%). For comparators, discontinuation was most frequently associated with nausea (<1%). The following adverse reactions were reported (<2%) in patients receiving tigecycline for injection in clinical studies: Body as a Whole : injection site inflammation, injection site pain, injection site reaction, septic shock, allergic reaction, chills, injection site edema, injection site phlebitis Cardiovascular System : thrombophlebitis Digestive System : anorexia, jaundice, abnormal stools Metabolic/Nutritional System : increased creatinine, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia Special Senses : taste perversion Hemic and Lymphatic System : prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prolonged prothrombin time (PT), eosinophilia, increased international normalized ratio (INR), thrombocytopenia Skin and Appendages : pruritus Urogenital System : vaginal moniliasis, vaginitis, leukorrhea 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tigecycline for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish causal relationship to drug exposure. anaphylactic reactions acute pancreatitis hepatic cholestasis, and jaundice severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome symptomatic hypoglycemia in patients with and without diabetes mellitus hypofibrinogenemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]"
