Limitations of Use Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma. The safety and effectiveness of Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA in asthma have not been established. Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA is a combination of umeclidinium, an anticholinergic, and vilanterol, a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA), indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma. ( 1 , 5.2 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA is contraindicated in: • patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to umeclidinium, vilanterol, or any of the excipients [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.6 ), Description ( 11 )] • use of a long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonist (LABA), including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA, without an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), in patients with asthma [see Warnings and Precautions ( .

( 4 ) • Use of a LABA, including Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA, without an inhaled corticosteroid is contraindicated in patients with asthma. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • LABA monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increases the risk of serious asthma-related events. ( 5.1 ) • Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating COPD. Do not use to treat acute symptoms. ( 5.2 ) • Do not use in combination with additional therapy containing a LABA because of risk of overdose. ( 5.3 ) • If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA and institute alternative therapy. ( 5.5 ) • Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation.

Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if symptoms occur. ( 5.10 ) • Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. ( 5.11 ) 5.1\tSerious Asthma-Related Events – Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death The safety and effectiveness of Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA in patients with asthma have not been established. Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] Use of LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone. Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART) A 28-week, placebo-controlled, U.S. trial that compared the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma‑related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABAs, including vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA. No trial adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in subjects treated with Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA has been conducted. Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD. 5.2\tDeterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD. Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD. The initiation of Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate. If Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient’s inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta 2 ‑agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, re‑evaluate the patient and the COPD treatment regimen at once. The daily dose of Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA should not be increased. Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists is a signal of deteriorating disease. In this situation, the patient requires immediate re-evaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the need for additional therapeutic options. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation of Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA once daily. Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist. When beginning treatment with Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. 5.3\tAvoid Excessive Use of Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA and Avoid Use with Other Long-Acting Beta 2 -Agonists Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other therapies containing LABAs, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. Patients using Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA should not use another therapy containing a LABA (e.g., salmeterol, formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason. 5.4\tDrug Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA with ketoconazole and other known strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (including, but not limited to, ritonavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, voriconazole) because increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.5\tParadoxical Bronchospasm As with other inhaled therapies, Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted. 5.6\tHypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, and urticaria may occur after administration of Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA. Discontinue Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA if such reactions occur. There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of other powder medications containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA [see Contraindications ( . 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] 5.7\tCardiovascular Effects Vilanterol, like other beta 2 -agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and also cardiac arrhythmias, such as supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles. If such effects occur, Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. 12.2 )] Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. In a 52-week trial of subjects with COPD, the exposure-adjusted rates for any on-treatment major adverse cardiac event, including non-fatal central nervous system hemorrhages and cerebrovascular conditions, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, and adjudicated on-treatment death due to cardiovascular events, was 2.2 per 100 patient-years for fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 100/62.5/25 mcg (n = 4,151), 1.9 per 100 patient-years for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg (n = 4,134), and 2.2 per 100 patient-years for umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA (n = 2,070). Adjudicated on‑treatment deaths due to cardiovascular events occurred in 20 of 4,151 patients (0.54 per 100 patient-years) receiving fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol, 27 of 4,134 patients (0.78 per 100 patient-years) receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, and 16 of 2,070 patients (0.94 per 100 patient-years) receiving umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA. 5.8\tCoexisting Conditions Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA, like all therapies containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. 5.9\tWorsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should also be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos, or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a healthcare provider immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.10\tWorsening of Urinary Retention Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA, like all therapies containing an anticholinergic, should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a healthcare provider immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.11\tHypokalemia and Hyperglycemia Beta-adrenergic agonist therapies may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Beta-agonist therapies may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients. In 4 clinical trials of 6-month duration evaluating umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA in subjects with COPD, there was no evidence of a treatment effect on serum glucose or potassium.",

The clinical program for umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA included 8,138 subjects with COPD in four 6‑month lung function trials, one 12-month long-term safety study, and 9 other trials of shorter duration. A total of 1,124 subjects have received at least 1 dose of umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA (umeclidinium/vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg), and 1,330 subjects have received a higher dose of umeclidinium/vilanterol (125/25 mcg). The safety data described below are based on the four 6-month and one 12-month trials. Adverse reactions observed in the other trials were similar to those observed in the confirmatory trials. 6-Month Trials The incidence of adverse reactions associated with umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA in Table 1 is based on four 6-month trials: 2 placebo-controlled trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2); N = 1,532 and N = 1,489, respectively) and 2 active-controlled trials (Trial 3 and Trial 4); N = 843 and N = 869, respectively). Of the 4,733 subjects, 68% were male and 84% were white. They had a mean age of 63 years and an average smoking history of 45 pack-years, with 50% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean postbronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) was 48% (range: 13% to 76%), the mean postbronchodilator FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 0.47 (range: 0.13 to 0.78), and the mean percent reversibility was 14% (range: -45% to 109%). Subjects received 1 dose once daily of the following: umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA, umeclidinium/vilanterol 125/25 mcg, umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, umeclidinium 125 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, active control, or placebo. Table 1. Adverse Reactions with Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA with ≥1% Incidence and More Common than Placebo in Subjects with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Adverse Reaction Umeclidinium and Vilanterol ELLIPTA (n = 842) % Umeclidinium 62.5 mcg (n = 418) % Vilanterol 25 mcg (n = 1,034) % Placebo (n = 555) % Infections and infestations Pharyngitis 2 1 2 <1 Sinusitis 1 <1 1 <1 Lower respiratory tract infection 1 <1 <1 <1 Gastrointestinal disorders Constipation 1 <1 <1 <1 Diarrhea 2 <1 2 1 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Pain in extremity 2 <1 2 1 Muscle spasms 1 <1 <1 <1 Neck pain 1 <1 <1 <1 General disorders and administration site conditions Chest pain 1 <1 <1 <1 Other adverse reactions with umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA observed with an incidence <1% but more common than placebo included the following: productive cough, dry mouth, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, musculoskeletal chest pain, chest discomfort, asthenia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular extrasystoles, supraventricular extrasystoles, myocardial infarction, pruritus, rash, and conjunctivitis. 12-Month Trial In a long-term safety trial (Trial 5), 335 subjects were treated for up to 12 months with umeclidinium/vilanterol 125/25 mcg or placebo. The demographic and baseline characteristics of the long-term safety trial were similar to those of the placebo‑controlled efficacy trials described above. Adverse reactions observed with a frequency of ≥1% in the group receiving umeclidinium/vilanterol 125/25 mcg that exceeded that in placebo in this trial were: headache, back pain, sinusitis, cough, urinary tract infection, arthralgia, nausea, vertigo, abdominal pain, pleuritic pain, viral respiratory tract infection, toothache, and diabetes mellitus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or causal connection to umeclidinium and vilanterol ELLIPTA or a combination of these factors. Cardiac Disorders Palpitations. Eye Disorders Blurred vision, eye pain, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria. Nervous System Disorders Dysgeusia, tremor. Psychiatric Disorders Anxiety. Renal and Urinary Disorders Dysuria, urinary retention. Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Dysphonia, paradoxical bronchospasm."
