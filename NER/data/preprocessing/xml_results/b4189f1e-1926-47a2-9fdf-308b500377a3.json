Monitor for malignancies and perform dermatologic evaluations prior to, while on therapy, and following discontinuation of treatment. ( 5.1 ) • Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors : Increased cell proliferation can occur with BRAF inhibitors. ( 5.2 ) • Cardiomyopathy : Assess left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) before initiating treatment with BRAFTOVI and binimetinib, and after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients with LVEF below 50% . ( 5.3 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment with BRAFTOVI and binimetinib and as clinically indicated. ( 5.4 ) • Hemorrhage : Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving BRAFTOVI and binimetinib. ( 5.5 ) • Uveitis : Perform ophthalmologic evaluation at regular intervals and for any visual disturbances. ( 5.6 ) • QT Prolongation : Monitor electrolytes before and during treatment. Correct electrolyte abnormalities and control for cardiac risk factors for QT prolongation. Withhold BRAFTOVI for QTc of 500 ms or greater. ( 5.7 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females with reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use effective nonhormonal method of contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) • Risks Associated with BRAFTOVI as a Single Agent : If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued, reduce the dose of BRAFTOVI as recommended. ( 5.9 ) • Risks Associated with Combination Treatment : BRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with binimetinib or cetuximab. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 New Primary Malignancies New primary malignancies, cutaneous and noncutaneous, have been observed in patients treated with BRAF inhibitors and can occur with BRAFTOVI. Cutaneous Malignancies In COLUMBUS, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cuSCC ) , including keratoacanthoma ( KA ) , occurred in 2.6% , and basal cell carcinoma occurred in 1.6% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Median time to first occurrence of cuSCC/KA was 5.8 months ( range 1 to 9 months ) [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] For patients who received BRAFTOVI as a single agent, cuSCC/KA was reported in 8% , basal cell carcinoma in 1% , and a new primary melanoma in 5% of patients. In BEACON CRC, cuSCC/KA occurred in 1.4% of patients with CRC, and a new primary melanoma occurred in 1.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab. In PHAROS, cuSCC and skin papilloma, each occurred in 2% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In BREAKWATER, skin papilloma was reported in 2.6% , basal cell carcinoma in 1.3% , squamous cell carcinoma of skin in 0.9% , keratoacanthoma in 0.4% and malignant melanoma in situ in 0.4% of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiating treatment, every 2 months during treatment, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of treatment. Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation. Dose modification is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies. Noncutaneous Malignancies Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI may promote malignancies associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms [see . Monitor patients receiving BRAFTOVI for signs and symptoms of noncutaneous malignancies. Discontinue BRAFTOVI for RAS mutation-positive noncutaneous malignancies Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] 5.2 Tumor Promotion in BRAF Wild-Type Tumors In vitro experiments have demonstrated paradoxical activation of MAP-kinase signaling and increased cell proliferation in BRAF wild-type cells, which are exposed to BRAF inhibitors. Confirm evidence of BRAF V600 E or V600 K mutation prior to initiating BRAFTOVI [see . Indications and Usage ( 1 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) ] 5.3 Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy, manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, evidence of cardiomyopathy ( decreased in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute decreased in LVEF ≥10% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA ) occurred in 7% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.6% of patients. The median time to first occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction ( any grade ) in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 3.6 months ( range 0 to 21 months ) . Cardiomyopathy resolved in 87% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib. In PHAROS, evidence of cardiomyopathy ( decrease in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute decrease in LVEF ≥10% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA ) occurred in 11% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1% of patients. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 82% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI plus binimetinib. Assess ejection fraction by echocardiogram or MUGA scan prior to initiating treatment, one month after initiating treatment, and every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib has not been established in patients with baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal ( LLN ) . Patients with cardiovascular risk factors should be monitored closely when treated with BRAFTOVI. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity can occur when BRAFTOVI is administered in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 6% for alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , 2.6% for aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , and 0.5% for alkaline phosphatase. In PHAROS, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 10% for AST, 9% for ALT, and 3.2% for alkaline phosphatase. In BREAKWATER, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 increases in liver function laboratory tests in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 was 2.2% for alkaline phosphatase, 1.3% for ALT, and 0.9% for AST. Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of BRAFTOVI, monthly during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.5 Hemorrhage In COLUMBUS, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; Grade 3 or greater hemorrhage occurred in 3.2% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were gastrointestinal, including rectal hemorrhage ( 4.2% ) , hematochezia ( 3.1% ) , and hemorrhoidal hemorrhage ( 1% ) . Fatal intracranial hemorrhage in the setting of new or progressive brain metastases occurred in 1.6% of patients. In BEACON CRC, hemorrhage occurred in 19% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab; Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage occurred in 1.9% of patients, including fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 0.5% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were epistaxis ( 6.9% ) , hematochezia ( 2.3% ) , and rectal hemorrhage ( 2.3% ) . In PHAROS, hemorrhage occurred in 12% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib including fatal hemorrhage intracranial ( 1% ) ; Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 4.1% of patients. The most frequent hemorrhagic events were anal hemorrhage and hemothorax ( 2% each ) . In BREAKWATER, hemorrhage occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6; Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.6 Uveitis Uveitis, including iritis and iridocyclitis, has been reported in patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, the incidence of uveitis among patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 4% . In PHAROS, the incidence of uveitis among patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib was 1% . Assess for visual symptoms at each visit. Perform an ophthalmologic evaluation at regular intervals and for new or worsening visual disturbances, and to follow new or persistent ophthalmologic findings. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.7 QT Prolongation BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation in some patients [see . In COLUMBUS, an increase in QTcF to >500 ms was measured in 0.5% ( 1/192 ) of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. In PHAROS, an increase in QTcF to >500 ms was measured in 2.1% ( 2/95 ) of patients who received BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib. Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] In BREAKWATER, an increase of QTcF >500 ms was measured in 3.6% ( 8/222 ) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Monitor patients who already have or who are at significant risk of developing QTc prolongation, including patients with known long QT syndromes, clinically significant bradyarrhythmias, severe or uncontrolled heart failure and those taking other medicinal products associated with QT prolongation. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during BRAFTOVI administration. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue for QTc >500 ms [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, BRAFTOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Encorafenib produced embryo-fetal developmental changes in rats and rabbits and was an abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 26 ( in the rat ) and 178 ( in the rabbit ) times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 450 mg, with no clear findings at lower doses. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective, nonhormonal method of contraception since BRAFTOVI can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective, during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of BRAFTOVI [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ] 5.9 Risks Associated with BRAFTOVI as a Single Agent BRAFTOVI when used as a single agent is associated with an increased risk of certain adverse reactions compared to when BRAFTOVI is used in combination with binimetinib. In COLUMBUS, Grades 3 or 4 dermatologic reactions occurred in 21% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI single agent compared to 2% of patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] If binimetinib is temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued, reduce the dose of BRAFTOVI as recommended [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] 5.10 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment BRAFTOVI is indicated for use as part of a regimen in combination with binimetinib, in combination with cetuximab, or in combination with cetuximab and mFOLFOX6. Refer to the prescribing information for binimetinib, cetuximab and individual product components of mFOLFOX6 for additional risk information.",

BRAF V600 E or V600 K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib is described in 192 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received BRAFTOVI ( 450 mg once daily ) in combination with binimetinib ( 45 mg twice daily ) in a randomized open-label, active-controlled trial ( COLUMBUS ) . The COLUMBUS trial [see excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc ( >480 ms ) , uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 11.8 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib and 6.2 months for patients treated with vemurafenib. Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] The most common ( ≥25% ) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were nausea ( 7% ) , vomiting ( 7% ) , and pyrexia ( 4% ) . Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 14% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were arthralgia ( 2% ) , fatigue ( 2% ) , and nausea ( 2% ) . Five percent ( 5% ) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI; the most common were hemorrhage in 2% and headache in 1% of patients. Table 5 and Table 6 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, as compared to vemurafenib, for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 5.
