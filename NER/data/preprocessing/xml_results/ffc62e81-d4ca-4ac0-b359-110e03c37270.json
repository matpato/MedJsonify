    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of AMELUZ prior to photodynamic therapy (PDT). If allergic reaction occurs, wash off AMELUZ and institute appropriate therapy ( 5.1 ). Transient Amnestic Episodes: Transient amnestic episodes have been reported with use of AMELUZ in combination with PDT. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if amnesia or confusion occurs after treatment ( 5.2 ). Risk of BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL Lamp Induced Eye Injury: Patients and healthcare providers must wear protective eyewear before operating BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL lamp ( 5.3 ). Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: Avoid direct contact of AMELUZ with the eyes ( 5.4 ). Increased Photosensitivity: Protect treated lesions from sunlight exposure for 48 hours post treatment ( 5.5 ). Risk of Bleeding in Patients with Coagulation Disorders: Take special care to avoid bleeding during lesion preparation in patients with inherited or acquired coagulation disorders ( 5.6 ). Mucous Membrane Irritation: Avoid direct contact of AMELUZ with the mucous membranes ( 5.7 ). 5.1 Hypersensitivity Several cases of hypersensitivity were reported during postmarketing use of AMELUZ prior to PDT illumination [ see ]. If allergic reactions occur, clean the area of skin where the product was applied and institute appropriate therapy. Inform patients and their caregivers that AMELUZ may cause hypersensitivity, potentially including severe courses (anaphylaxis). Adverse Reactions (6.2) 5.2 Transient Amnestic Episodes Transient amnestic episodes have been reported during postmarketing use of AMELUZ in combination with photodynamic therapy. Inform patients and their caregivers that AMELUZ in combination with photodynamic therapy may cause transient amnestic episodes. Advise them to contact the healthcare provider if the patient develops amnesia after treatment. 5.3 Risk of BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL Lamp Induced Eye Injury BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL lamp may cause eye irritation, glare, or injury. Before operating the lamp, personnel must refer to the user manual for specific warnings, cautions, and instructions. Eye exposure to the BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL light must be prevented. Protective eye equipment must be used by patient, healthcare providers and any person present during the illumination period. Avoid staring directly into the light source. 5.4 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Eyelid edema and dry eyes have occurred after PDT with AMELUZ. PDT with AMELUZ can cause ophthalmic adverse reactions. Avoid direct contact of AMELUZ with the eyes. Rinse eyes with water in case of accidental contact. 5.5 Increased Photosensitivity AMELUZ increases photosensitivity. Avoid sunlight, prolonged or intense light (e.g., tanning beds, sun lamps) on lesions and surrounding skin treated with AMELUZ for approximately 48 hours following treatment, whether exposed to illumination or not. Concomitant use of AMELUZ with other known photosensitizing agents may increase the risk of phototoxic reaction to PDT [see . Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.6 Risk of Bleeding in Patients with Coagulation Disorders AMELUZ has not been tested on patients with inherited or acquired coagulation disorders. Take special care to avoid bleeding during lesion preparation in such patients [ . Any bleeding must be stopped before application of the gel. see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.7 Risk of Mucous Membrane Irritation AMELUZ can cause mucous membrane irritation. AMELUZ is intended for topical use only. Avoid direct contact of AMELUZ to the mucous membranes. Rinse with water in case of accidental contact.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: ​ Hypersensitivity [ see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) Transient Amnestic Episodes [ see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Risk of BF-RhodoLED or RhodoLED XL Lamp Induced Eye Injury [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Increased Photosensitivity [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were application site erythema, pain/burning, irritation, edema, pruritus, exfoliation, scab, induration, and vesicles ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biofrontera Inc. at 1-844-829-7434 or FDA at 1-800-332-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The clinical program for AMELUZ included three double-blind and placebo-controlled phase 3 trials (Trials 1, 2, and 3), enrolling a total of 299 subjects that were treated with narrow band light. Trial subjects were adults greater than or equal to 49 years of age, and the majority had Fitzpatrick skin type I, II, or III. No subjects had Fitzpatrick skin type V or VI. Approximately 86% of subjects were male, and all subjects were White. For all three phase 3 trials, the enrolled subjects had mild to moderate AKs (Olsen grade 1 and 2) with 4 to 8 lesions on the face and scalp. Overall, 212 AMELUZ-treated subjects (n=32, n=55, and n=125) and 87 subjects receiving placebo (n=16, n=32, n=39) were illuminated with BF-RhodoLED or similar narrow spectrum lamps. For these trials, the maximal dose was one tube of AMELUZ (2 g) and the size of the application area was up to 20 cm 2 . Local skin reactions at the application site were observed in about 99.5% of subjects treated with AMELUZ and narrow spectrum lamps. The most frequent adverse reactions during and after PDT were application site erythema, pain, burning, irritation, edema, pruritus, exfoliation, scab, induration, and vesicles. Most adverse reactions occurred during illumination or shortly afterwards, were generally of mild or moderate intensity, and lasted for 1 to 4 days in most cases; in some cases, however, they persisted for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. Severe pain/burning occurred in up to 30% of subjects. In one case, the adverse reactions required interruption or discontinuation of the illumination. Table 1 presents the incidence of common (≥1%, <10%) and very common (≥10%) adverse reactions at the application site in randomized, multicenter trials which evaluated a maximal dose of one tube of AMELUZ (2 g) and an application area up to 20 cm 2 . Table 1: Incidence of Adverse Reactions Occurring at ≥1% of the AMELUZ Group and More Frequently than the Vehicle Group in Actinic Keratosis Trials 1, 2, and 3 at the Application Site Adverse reaction Vehicle n=87 AMELUZ n=212 Adverse reactions at the application site Erythema Pain/Burning Irritation Edema Pruritus Exfoliation Scab Induration Vesicles Paresthesia Hyperalgesia Reaction Discomfort Erosion Discharge Bleeding Pustules 34 (39%) 26 (30%) 17 (20%) 3 (3%) 14 (16%) 4 (5%) 2 (2%) 0 (0%) 1 (1%) 2 (2%) 0 (0%) 2 (2%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 195 (92%) 195 (92%) 153 (72%) 75 (35%) 72 (34%) 41 (19%) 41 (19%) 26 (12%) 25 (12%) 18 (9%) 13 (6%) 8 (4%) 7 (3%) 6 (3%) 4 (2%) 3 (1%) 3 (1%) Common (≥1%, <10%) adverse reactions not at the application site for AMELUZ maximal dose of one tube (2 g) and application area up to 20 cm 2 were headache, skin exfoliation, chills and eyelid edema. Less common (≥0.1%, <1%) adverse reactions at the application site for AMELUZ maximal dose of one tube (2 g) and application area up to 20 cm 2 were hemorrhage and swelling. The adverse reactions not at the application site were blister, feeling hot, pruritus, pyrexia, scab, nervousness, pain, petechiae, rash pustular, skin erosion and ulcer. In a clinical trial designed to investigate the sensitization potential of aminolevulinic acid with 216 healthy subjects, 13 subjects (6%) developed allergic contact dermatitis after continuous exposure for 21 days with doses of aminolevulinic acid that were higher than doses normally used in the treatment of AK. In two open label clinical trials to evaluate safety and tolerability, 116 subjects with actinic keratosis (AK) on the face and scalp were treated with three tubes (6 g) of AMELUZ applied to a 60 cm² area. Most adverse reactions observed were consistent with those reported in trials using one tube (2 g) of AMELUZ on a 20 cm² area (see Table 1). Additional reactions which occurred in ≥1% of subjects when three tubes (6 g) of AMELUZ were applied to a 60 cm² area included dry eyes, photosensitivity, and application site discoloration, dryness, papules, and fissures. The frequencies of certain adverse reactions at the application site in these trials—exfoliation, itching, scabbing, and erosion—were more than 10% higher with the larger dose (three tubes, 6 g) and treatment area (60 cm²) compared to the frequencies observed in the trials for the smaller dose (one tube, 2 g) and area (20 cm²). Severe application site pain was reported by 41% of the subjects treated with three tubes (6 g) on a 60 cm² area. Most cases were reported during PDT illumination. A total of 15% of subjects discontinued illumination due to adverse reactions. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of AMELUZ. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: allergic dermatitis, application site inflammation, application site discoloration. Eye disorders: eye irritation, diplopia, ocular hyperemia, photophobia, and blurred vision. General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue. Immune System disorders: hypersensitivity. Nervous system disorders: dysaesthesia, transient amnestic episodes."
