Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis. ( 5.7 , 2.4 ) Serious Febrile Reactions : Can occur when MEKINIST is used with dabrafenib. ( 5.8 , 2.4 ) Serious Skin Toxicities : Monitor for skin toxicities and for secondary infections. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for intolerable Grade 2 or for Grade 3 or 4 rash not improving within 3 weeks despite interruption of MEKINIST. Permanently discontinue for severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs). ( 5.9 , 2.4 ) Hyperglycemia : Monitor serum glucose levels in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. ( 5.10 ) Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) : Interrupt treatment for suspected HLH. Discontinue treatment if HLH is confirmed. ( 5.12 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.13 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNew Primary Malignancies Cutaneous Malignancies MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCCs) and keratoacanthomas occurred in 2% of patients. Basal cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma occurred in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, new primary melanoma occurred in < 1% of patients. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of MEKINIST when used with dabrafenib, every 2 months while on therapy, and for up to 6 months following discontinuation of the combination. Non-Cutaneous Malignancies Based on its mechanism of action, dabrafenib may promote growth and development of malignancies with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms; refer to the prescribing information for dabrafenib. In the pooled safety population of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, non-cutaneous malignancies occurred in 1% of patients. Monitor patients receiving MEKINIST and dabrafenib closely for signs or symptoms of non-cutaneous malignancies. No dose modification is required for MEKINIST in patients who develop non-cutaneous malignancies. 5.2\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHemorrhage Hemorrhages, including major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with MEKINIST. Fatal cases have been reported. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , hemorrhagic events occurred in 17% of patients; gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 3% of patients; intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 0.6% of patients; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.5% of patients. The fatal events were cerebral hemorrhage and brainstem hemorrhage. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, hemorrhagic events occurred in 25% of patients; the most common type of bleeding was epistaxis (16%). Serious events of bleeding occurred in 3.6% of patients and included gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1.2%), cerebral hemorrhage (0.6%) uterine hemorrhage (0.6%), post-procedural hemorrhage (0.6%), and epistaxis (0.6%). Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for all Grade 4 hemorrhagic events and for any Grade 3 hemorrhagic events that do not improve. Withhold MEKINIST for Grade 3 hemorrhagic events; if improved, resume MEKINIST at the next lower dose level. 5.3\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tColitis and Gastrointestinal Perforation Colitis and gastrointestinal perforation, including fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients taking: MEKINIST Monotherapy and Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , colitis occurred in < 1% of patients and gastrointestinal perforation occurred in < 1% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, colitis events occurred in <1% of patients. Monitor patients closely for colitis and gastrointestinal perforations. 5.4\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVenous Thromboembolic Events MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in 2% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, embolism events occurred in < 1% of patients. Advise patients to immediately seek medical care if they develop symptoms of DVT or PE, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for life-threatening PE. Withhold MEKINIST for uncomplicated DVT and PE for up to 3 weeks; if improved, MEKINIST may be resumed at a lower dose level [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.5\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy, including cardiac failure, can occur with MEKINIST. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. Development of cardiomyopathy resulted in dose interruption or discontinuation of MEKINIST in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 45 of 50 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, cardiomyopathy,  defined as a decrease in LVEF ≥ 10% from baseline and below the institutional LLN, occurred in 9% of patients. Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of MEKINIST as a single agent or with dabrafenib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. For an asymptomatic absolute decrease in LVEF of 10% or greater from baseline that is below the institutional LLN, withhold MEKINIST for up to 4 weeks. If improved to normal LVEF value, resume MEKINIST at a lower dose. If no improvement to normal LVEF value within 4 weeks, permanently discontinue MEKINIST. For symptomatic cardiomyopathy or an absolute decrease in LVEF of greater than 20% from baseline that is below the institutional LLN, permanently discontinue MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.6\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOcular Toxicities Retinal Vein Occlusion In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST monotherapy, the incidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) was 0.6%. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, there were no cases of RVO. RVO may lead to macular edema, decreased visual function, neovascularization, and glaucoma. Urgently (within 24 hours) perform ophthalmological evaluation for patient-reported loss of vision or other visual disturbances. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST in patients with documented RVO [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment Retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) can occur with MEKINIST. Retinal detachments may be bilateral and multifocal, occurring in the central macular region of the retina or elsewhere in the retina. In melanoma and NSCLC trials, routine monitoring of patients to detect asymptomatic RPED was not conducted; therefore, the true incidence of this finding is unknown. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, RPED events occurred in < 1% of patients. Perform ophthalmological evaluation periodically and at any time a patient reports visual disturbances. Withhold MEKINIST if RPED is diagnosed. If resolution of the RPED is documented on repeat ophthalmological evaluation within 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at same or reduced dose. If no improvement after 3 weeks, resume MEKINIST at reduced dose or permanently discontinue MEKINIST [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.7\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInterstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST monotherapy, interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 2% of patients. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, ILD or pneumonitis occurred in 1% of patients. Withhold MEKINIST in patients presenting with new or progressive pulmonary symptoms and findings, including cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, or infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.8\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSerious Febrile Reactions Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity accompanied by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure, can occur when MEKINIST is administered with dabrafenib. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , fever occurred in 58% of patients. Serious febrile reactions and fever of any severity complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration or renal failure occurred in 5% of patients. Fever was complicated by hypotension in 4%, dehydration in 3%, syncope in 2%, renal failure in 1%, and severe chills/rigors in < 1% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , pyrexia occurred in 66% of patients. Withhold MEKINIST when used as monotherapy, and both MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in combination, if the patient’s temperature is ≥ 100.4°F. In case of recurrence, therapy can also be interrupted at the first symptom of pyrexia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Fever may be complicated by hypotension, rigors or chills, dehydration, or renal failure. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of infection and monitor serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function during and following severe pyrexia. If appropriate, MEKINIST, or both MEKINIST and dabrafenib when used in combination, may be restarted if the patient has recovered from the febrile reaction for at least 24 hours, either at same or lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Administer antipyretics as secondary prophylaxis when resuming MEKINIST if patient had a prior episode of severe febrile reaction or fever associated with complications. Administer corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 10 mg daily) for at least 5 days for second or subsequent pyrexia if temperature does not return to baseline within 3 days of onset of pyrexia, or for pyrexia associated with complications, such as dehydration, hypotension, renal failure, or severe chills/rigors, and there is no evidence of active infection. 5.9\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSerious Skin Toxicities Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , other serious skin toxicity occurred in < 1% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, serious adverse events of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders occurred in 1.8% of patients. Monitor for new or worsening serious skin reactions. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST for SCARs [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . For other skin toxicities, withhold MEKINIST for intolerable or severe skin toxicity. Resume MEKINIST at a lower dose in patients with improvement or recovery from skin toxicity within 3 weeks. Permanently discontinue MEKINIST if skin toxicity has not improved in 3 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.10\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHyperglycemia MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Adult) : In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] , 15% of patients with a history of diabetes who had received MEKINIST with dabrafenib required more intensive hypoglycemic therapy. Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia occurred in 2% of patients. MEKINIST Administered with Dabrafenib (Pediatric) : In the pooled safety population, Grade 3 and Grade 4 hyperglycemia events occurred in < 1% of patients. Monitor serum glucose levels upon initiation and as clinically appropriate when MEKINIST is administered with dabrafenib in patients with preexisting diabetes or hyperglycemia. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic medications as clinically indicated. 5.11\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRisks Associated with Combination Treatment MEKINIST is indicated for use in combination with dabrafenib. Review the prescribing information for dabrafenib for information on the serious risks of dabrafenib prior to initiation of MEKINIST with dabrafenib. 5.12\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been observed in the post-marketing setting when MEKINIST was administered with dabrafenib. If HLH is suspected, interrupt treatment. If HLH is confirmed, discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate management of HLH. 5.13\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0.3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] .",

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST. Table 6 and Table 7 present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, of MEKINIST as a single agent in the METRIC study. Table 6.

In both trials, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Both trials excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO or RPED, QTcB interval ≥ 480 msec, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Among these 559 patients, 197 (35%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 185 (33%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, and 98% were White, 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status of 1, 64% had M1c disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, and 0.5% had a history of brain metastases. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) for MEKINIST in patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies were: pyrexia, nausea, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, and peripheral edema. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-d study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 3 days to 30 months) to MEKINIST. Among the 209 patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib, 26% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 46% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. In the COMBI-d study, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MEKINIST occurred in 11% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (1.4%) and decreased ejection fraction (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKINIST occurred in 18% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.9%), neutropenia (1.9%), decreased ejection fraction (1.9%), and rash (1.9%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of MEKINIST occurred in 46% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (18%), chills (7%), vomiting (6%), and decreased ejection fraction (4.8%).

Patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) who required first systemic therapy were randomized (2:1) to MEKINIST plus dabrafenib (n = 73) or carboplatin plus vincristine (n = 33). Nine patients crossed over from the carboplatin plus vincristine arm to the MEKINIST and dabrafenib arm. Pediatric patients received weight-based MEKINIST orally once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients in the control arm received carboplatin and vincristine at doses of 175 mg/m 2 and 1.5 mg/m 2 , respectively in 10-week induction course followed by eight 6-week cycles of maintenance therapy or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Among patients with low-grade glioma who were randomized to MEKINIST plus dabrafenib (n = 73), 95% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 71% were exposed for greater than one year. The median age of these patients was 10 years (range: 1 to 17); 60% female; 75% White, 7% Asian, 2.7% Black or African American, 4% other race, and 11% where race was unknown or not reported. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of these patients. Serious adverse reactions in > 3% of patients included pyrexia (14%) and vomiting (4%). Permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST included chills, fatigue, pyrexia, weight increased, and headache. Dosage interruptions of MEKINIST due to an adverse reaction occurred in 70% of patients. Adverse reactions which required a dosage interruption in > 5% of patients included pyrexia (52%).
