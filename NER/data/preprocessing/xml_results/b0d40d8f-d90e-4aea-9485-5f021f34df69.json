    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use and estimating their relative rates. Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2%) were headache, and dysmenorrhea, genital burning and itching.
