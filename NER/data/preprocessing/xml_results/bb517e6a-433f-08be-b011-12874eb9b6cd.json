Warnings and Precautions (5.1)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity, and angioedema have been reported.  In the event of a reaction, discontinue TRELSTAR and initiate appropriate medical management.  ( ) 5.1 Tumor Flare: Transient increase in serum testosterone levels can occur within the first few weeks of treatment.  This may worsen prostate cancer and result in spinal cord compression and urinary tract obstruction. Monitor patients at risk and manage as appropriate.  ( ) 5.2 Metabolic Syndrome: The use of GnRH agonists may lead to an increased risk of metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Monitor for signs and symptoms of metabolic syndrome including lipids, blood glucose level and/or HbA1c and manage according to institutional guidelines. ( ) 5.3 Cardiovascular Diseases: Increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in men. Monitor for cardiovascular disease and manage according toto institutional guidelines. ( ) 5.4 Convulsions: Convulsions have occurred in patients treated with GnRH analogs (including TRELSTAR) with or without a history of predisposing factors. Manage patients who experience convulsions according to institutional guidelines. ( ) 5.5 Effect on QT/QTc Interval: Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval. Consider risks and benefits. ( ) 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: TRELSTAR may cause fetal harm. ( , 5.9 ) 8.1 5.1        Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic shock, hypersensitivity, and angioedema related to TRELSTAR administration have been reported. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue TRELSTAR immediately and administer the appropriate supportive and symptomatic care. 5.2        Tumor Flare Initially, triptorelin (TRELSTAR), like other GnRH agonists, causes a transient increase in serum testosterone levels [ see ]. As a result, worsening signs and symptoms of prostate cancer during the first weeks of treatment have been reported with GnRH agonists. Patients may experience worsening of symptoms or onset of new symptoms, including bone pain, neuropathy, hematuria, or urethral or bladder outlet obstruction. Clinical Pharmacology  (12.2) Closely monitor patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction during the first few weeks of therapy. 5.3        Metabolic Syndrome The use of GnRH agonists (including TRELSTAR) may lead to metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including cirrhosis, occurred in the post-marketing setting.  Hyperglycemia may represent new-onset of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with pre-existing diabetes. Monitor for changes in serum lipids, blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) periodically in patients receiving TRELSTAR and manage according to institutional guidelines. 5.4        Cardiovascular Diseases Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with the use of GnRH agonists (including TRELSTAR) in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Monitor patients receiving TRELSTAR for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and manage according to current institutional guidelines. 5.5       Convulsions Convulsions have occurred in patients treated with GnRH analog (including TRELSTAR).  These events included patients with risk factors for seizures such as a history of epilepsy, intracranial tumors or co-medication with other drugs known to present a risk of seizure reactions.  Convulsions have also been reported in patients in the absence of known risk factors. Manage patients receiving TRELSTAR who experience convulsion according to institutional guidelines. 5.6       Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy with TRELSTAR may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. 5.7       Laboratory Tests Monitor serum levels of testosterone following injection of TRELSTAR. In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline, and then declined thereafter to castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) within four weeks [see . Clinical Studies ( 14 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] 5.8       Laboratory Test Interactions Chronic or continuous administration of TRELSTAR in therapeutic doses results in suppression of pituitary-gonadal axis.  Diagnostic tests of the pituitary-gonadal function conducted during treatment and after cessation of therapy may therefore be misleading. 5.9       Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and mechanism of action, TRELSTAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] .  In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, daily administration of triptorelin to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity and embryo-fetal toxicities, including loss of pregnancy, at doses as low as 0.2, 0.8, and 8 times the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .",

The safety of the three TRELSTAR formulations was evaluated in clinical trials involving patients with advanced prostate cancer.  Mean testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week following the initial injection, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment.  The transient increase in testosterone levels may be associated with temporary worsening of disease signs and symptoms, including bone pain, neuropathy, hematuria, and urethral or bladder outlet obstruction. Spinal cord compression with weakness or paralysis of the lower extremities have occurred [ see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.2) Adverse reactions reported for each of the three TRELSTAR formulations in the clinical trials, are presented in Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4.  The majority of adverse reactions related to TRELSTAR are a result of its pharmacological action, i.e., the induced variation in serum testosterone levels, either an increase in testosterone at the initiation of treatment, or a decrease in testosterone once castration is achieved. Local reactions at the injection site or allergic reactions may occur. The following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to therapy as described by the treating physician in at least 1% of patients receiving TRELSTAR 3.75 mg.

TRELSTAR 11.25 mg : Decreased hemoglobin and RBC count and increased glucose, BUN, SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase at the Day 253 visit. TRELSTAR 22.5 mg : Decreased hemoglobin and increased glucose and hepatic transaminases were detected during the study. The majority of the changes were mild to moderate. 6.2       Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Pituitary Apoplexy – During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy (a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.  In majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour.  In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse.  Immediate medical attention has been required.
