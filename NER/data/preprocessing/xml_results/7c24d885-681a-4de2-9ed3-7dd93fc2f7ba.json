    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions : ( 5.1 ) Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, and solid organ transplant rejection. Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA based on the severity of reaction. Infusion-Related Reactions : Slow the rate of infusion, interrupt, or permanently discontinue based on severity of infusion reaction. ( 5.2 ) Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) : Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\tSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions TEVIMBRA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity [see . In general, if TEVIMBRA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroids. Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which can be fatal. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.9% (96/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (1.6%), and Grade 2 (1.9%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA in 38 (1.9%) patients and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 32 (1.6%) patients. Seventy-four (77.1%) of the 96 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Sixty-five (67.7%) of the 96 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Immune-mediated pneumonitis resolved in 50% of the 96 patients. Of the 32 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for pneumonitis, 20 (62.5%) reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, 2 (10%) patients had recurrence of pneumonitis. Immune-Mediated Colitis TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which can be fatal. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 0.8% (16/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 3 (0.3%) and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA in 4 (0.2%) patients and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 5 (0.3%) patients. Twelve (75%) of the 16 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Eight (50%) of the 16 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Two (12.5%) of the 16 patients received immunosuppressive treatment. Immune-mediated colitis resolved in 93.8% of the 16 patients. All 5 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for colitis reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, none of the patients had recurrence of colitis. Immune-Mediated Hepatitis TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, which can be fatal. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 1.2% (24/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.2%), Grade 3 (0.5%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation in 3 (0.2%) patients and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 13 (0.7%) patients. Eighteen (75%) of the 24 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Thirteen (54.2%) of the 24 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Two (8.3%) of the 24 patients received immunosuppressive treatment. Immune-mediated hepatitis resolved in 70.8% of the 24 patients. Of the 13 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for hepatitis, 7 (53.8%) reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, none of the patients had recurrence of hepatitis. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold TEVIMBRA depending on severity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Immune-mediated adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.4% (8/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 4 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Adrenal insufficiency did not lead to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA. TEVIMBRA was withheld in 7 out of 8 patients. All 8 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Three (37.5%) of the 8 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency resolved in 25% of the 8 patients. Of the 7 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for adrenal insufficiency, 5 (71.4%) reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, none of the patients had recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. Hypophysitis TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Hypophysitis/hypopituitarism occurred in 0.2% (4/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Hypophysitis did not lead to permanent discontinuation in any patient, while treatment was withheld in 1 (0.1%) patient. Three (75%) of the 4 patients received systemic corticosteroids. One (25%) of the 4 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis/hypopituitarism did not resolve in the 4 patients. For the 1 patient where TEVIMBRA was withheld for hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, there was no recurrence of hypophysitis/hypopituitarism. Thyroid Disorders TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Thyroiditis: Immune-mediated thyroiditis occurred in 1.2% (24/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 2 (0.5%) adverse reactions. Thyroiditis did not lead to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA. TEVIMBRA was withheld in 3 (0.2%) patients. Two (8.3%) of the 24 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Thyroiditis resolved in 41.7% of the 24 patients. All three patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for thyroiditis reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, none of the patients had recurrence of thyroiditis. Hyperthyroidism: Immune-mediated hyperthyroidism occurred in 4.8% (95/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.9%) adverse reactions. Hyperthyroidism led to the permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA in 1 (0.1%) patient and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 4 (0.2%) patients. One (1.1%) of the 95 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 75.8% of the 95 patients. Of the 4 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for hyperthyroidism, 3 (75%) reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, none of the patients had recurrence of hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism: Immune-mediated hypothyroidism occurred in 12.7% (250/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 4 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.8%) adverse reactions. TEVIMBRA was not permanently discontinued in any patient, while treatment was withheld in 7 (0.4%) patients. Two (0.8%) of the 250 patients received systemic corticosteroids. One hundred fifty-eight patients (63.2%) received hormone replacement therapy. Hypothyroidism resolved in 31.6% of the 250 patients. The majority (54%) of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. Of the 7 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for hypothyroidism, 6 (85.7%) reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, none of the patients had recurrence of hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Which Can Present with Diabetic Ketoacidosis Diabetes mellitus has been reported with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.9% (18/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 4 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. TEVIMBRA was permanently discontinued in 3 (0.2%) patients and TEVIMBRA treatment was withheld in 3 (0.2%) patients. Twelve (66.7%) patients received insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus resolved in 27.8% of the 18 patients. Of the 3 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for diabetes mellitus, none of the patients reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement. Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated nephritis, which can be fatal. Immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction occurred in 0.3% (6/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. TEVIMBRA was permanently discontinued in 1 (0.1%) patient and treatment was withheld in 3 (0.2%) patients. Three (50%) patients received systemic corticosteroids. Three (50%) of the 6 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Nephritis with renal dysfunction resolved in 33.3% of the 6 patients. Of the 3 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for nephritis, 2 (66.7%) reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, one (50%) patient had recurrence of nephritis. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions TEVIMBRA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported, some with fatal outcomes. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA depending on severity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 15.3% (301/1972) of patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 4 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (3.5%) adverse reactions. Dermatologic adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA in 2 (0.1%) patients and withholding of TEVIMBRA in 18 (0.9%) patients, thirty (10%) of the 301 patients received systemic corticosteroids. Thirteen (4.3%) of the 301 patients received high-dose systemic corticosteroids. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions resolved in 63.1% of the 301 patients. Of the 18 patients in whom TEVIMBRA was withheld for dermatologic adverse reactions, 15 (83.3%) reinitiated TEVIMBRA after symptom improvement; of these, 1 (6.7%) patient had recurrence of immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reaction. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of less than 1% each in patients who received TEVIMBRA: myositis, myocarditis, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, encephalitis, myasthenia gravis, Sjogren's syndrome, and pericarditis. The following additional clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions have been reported with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, including severe or fatal cases. Cardiac/Vascular: Vasculitis. Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barre syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy. Ocular: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure. Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism. Other (Hematologic/Immune): Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. 5.2\tInfusion-Related Reactions TEVIMBRA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 5% (99/1972) patients receiving TEVIMBRA, including Grade 3 or higher (0.2%) reactions. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) and interrupt the infusion for moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue TEVIMBRA [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.3\tComplications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, TEVIMBRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-mediated rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TEVIMBRA and for 4 months after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]",

The pooled safety population described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to TEVIMBRA as a single agent in 1972 patients enrolled in two randomized open-label, active-controlled studies (RATIONALE-302, BGB-A317-303) and five open-label, single-arm studies (BGB-A317-208, BGB-A317-204, BGB-A317-203, BGB-A317-102, BGB-A317_Study_001), which enrolled 307 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 1665 patients with advanced or recurrent tumors. TEVIMBRA was administered at a dose of 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks, except in study BGB-A317_Study_001 where patients also received other dosage regimens. Among the 1972 patients, 37.8% were exposed for longer than 6 months, and 21.8% were exposed for longer than 12 months. First-line Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic Esophageal Carcinoma (ESCC) The safety of TEVIMBRA in combination with chemotherapy was evaluated in RATIONALE-306, a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind trial in patients with unresectable, advanced, or metastatic ESCC [see . Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either TEVIMBRA 200 mg by intravenous infusion over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks or placebo plus a chemotherapy doublet regimen. The chemotherapy doublet regimens consisted of: Platinum (cisplatin [60 to 80 mg/m 2 IV, on Day 1] or oxaliplatin [130 mg/m 2 IV, on Day 1]) and a fluoropyrimidine (5-FU [750 to 800 mg/m 2 IV, on Day 1 to 5] or capecitabine [1000 mg/m 2 orally twice daily, on Day 1 to 14]), or Platinum (cisplatin [60 to 80 mg/m 2 IV, on Day 1 or 2] or oxaliplatin [130 mg/m 2 IV, on Day 1 or 2]) and (paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 IV, on Day 1) Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure was 6.4 months (range: 0.1 to 38.3 months) in TEVIMBRA-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 48% of patients receiving TEVIMBRA in combination with chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were pneumonia (5.2%), dysphagia (5.2%), diarrhea (2.2%), fatigue (2.2%), and esophageal stenosis (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients who received TEVIMBRA in combination with chemotherapy. Permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA due to adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients. The adverse reaction which resulted in discontinuation in ≥2% of patients was pneumonitis (2.2%). Dosage interruptions of TEVIMBRA due to adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in ≥2% of patients were neutrophil count decreased (7%), fatigue (6%), pneumonia (6%), anemia (4.3%), neutropenia (4.3%), white blood cell count decreased (4.3%), rash (3.7%), dysphagia (2.8%), platelet count decreased (2.8%), pyrexia (2.8%), and diarrhea (2.2%). The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions including laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count, decreased sodium, increased glucose, anemia, fatigue, decreased appetite, increased AST, decreased potassium, increased serum creatinine, decreased calcium, increased ALT, diarrhea, stomatitis, and vomiting. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities are listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of exposure was 2.8 months (range: 0.2 to 28.3 months) in TEVIMBRA-treated patients and 1.5 months (range: 0.2 to 19.2 months) in paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan-treated patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients; the most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2%) were pneumonia, dysphagia, hemorrhage, pneumonitis (including pneumonitis and immune-mediated pneumonitis), and esophageal obstruction. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 7% of patients who received TEVIMBRA, including the following which occurred in more than one patient: pneumonia/pneumonitis (5 patients), hemorrhage (3 patients), and death due to an unknown cause (3 patients). Permanent discontinuation of TEVIMBRA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation in ≥1% of patients were hemorrhage, pneumonitis (including pneumonitis and immune-mediated pneumonitis), and pneumonia. Dosage interruptions of TEVIMBRA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruptions in ≥2% of patients were pneumonia, pneumonitis, and fatigue.
