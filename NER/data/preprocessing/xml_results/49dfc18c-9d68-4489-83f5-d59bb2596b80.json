    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Because of the risk of serotonin syndrome, do not use MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules or within 5 weeks of stopping treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Do not use olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. In addition, do not start olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. ( Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) : 4.1 ) Do not use. Risk of QT interval prolongation ( Pimozid e: 4.2 , 5.20 , 7.7 , 7.8 ) Do not use. Risk of QT interval prolongation. Do not use thioridazine within 5 weeks of discontinuing olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules ( Thioridazine : 4.2 , 5.20 , 7.7 , 7.8 ) 4.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules or within 5 weeks of stopping treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Starting olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.5 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] 4.2 Other Contraindications Pimozide [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.20 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.7 , 7.8 )] Thioridazine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.20 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.7 , 7.8 )] Pimozide and thioridazine prolong the QT interval. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules can increase the levels of pimozide and thioridazine through inhibition of CYP2D6. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules can also prolong the QT interval.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring ( Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome : 5.3 ) Discontinue if DRESS is suspected ( Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) : 5.4 ) Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain ( Metabolic Changes : 5.5 ) In some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death. Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia. Perform fasting blood glucose testing before beginning, and periodically during treatment. ( Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus : 5.5 ) Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended, including fasting blood lipid testing before beginning, and periodically during, treatment ( Dyslipidemia : 5.5 ) Consider potential consequences of weight gain. Monitor weight regularly ( Weight gain : 5.5 ) Serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs, including olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, both when taken alone, but especially when co-administered with other serotonergic agents. If such symptoms occur, discontinue olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and serotonergic agents and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases ( Serotonin Syndrome : 5.6 ) Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants ( Angle-Closure Glaucoma : 5.7 ) Discontinue upon appearance of rash or allergic phenomena ( Allergic Reactions and Rash : 5.8 ) Screen for Bipolar Disorder and monitor for activation of mania/hypomania ( Activation of Mania/Hypomania : 5.9 ) Discontinue if clinically appropriate ( Tardive Dyskinesia : 5.10 ) Can be associated with bradycardia and syncope. Risk is increased during initial dose titration. Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease, and those conditions that could affect hemodynamic responses ( Orthostatic Hypotension : 5.11 ) Has been reported with antipsychotics, including olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low white blood cell count (WBC) or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy. Consider discontinuing olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors ( Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis : 5.13 ) Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold ( Seizures : 5.15 ) SSRIs increase the risk of bleeding. Use with NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation may potentiate the risk of gastrointestinal or other bleeding ( Increased Risk of Bleeding : 5.16 ) Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Consider discontinuing olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules if symptomatic hyponatremia occurs (SIADH) ( Hyponatremia : 5.17 ) Has potential to impair judgment, thinking, and motor skills. Caution patients about operating machinery ( Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment : 5.18 ) QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including Torsade de Pointes have been reported with fluoxetine. Use with caution in conditions that predispose to arrhythmias or increased fluoxetine exposure. Use cautiously in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation ( QT Prolongation : 4.2 , 5.20 ) : Use with caution with other anticholinergic drugs and in patients with urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, constipation, history of paralytic ileus or related conditions ( Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects 5.21 ) May elevate prolactin levels ( Hyperprolactinemia : 5.22 ) Changes in dose will not be fully reflected in plasma for several weeks ( Long Elimination Half-Life of Fluoxetine : 5.24 ) Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules use may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction ( Sexual Dysfunction: 5.26 ) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug versus placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case â‰¥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patientâ€™s presenting symptoms. If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.25 )] Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for Major Depressive Disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. It should be noted that olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for use in treating any indications in patients less than 10 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] 5.2 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . In olanzapine placebo-controlled clinical trials of elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, the incidence of death in olanzapine-treated patients was significantly greater than placebo-treated patients (3.5% vs 1.5%, respectively). Meta-Analysis of Antipsychotic Use in Dementia-Related Psychosis â€“ Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] . Cerebrovascular Adverse Events (CVAE), Including Stroke â€” Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of olanzapine in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with placebo. Olanzapine and olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see . Boxed Warning ] 5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as NMS has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If after recovering from NMS, a patient requires treatment with an antipsychotic, the patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.5 )] 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with olanzapine exposure. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. DRESS is sometimes fatal. Discontinue olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules if DRESS is suspected. 5.5 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. Metabolic changes may be associated with increased cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. Olanzapineâ€™s specific metabolic profile is presented below. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Adults â€” Healthcare providers should consider the risks and benefits when prescribing olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or having borderline increased blood glucose level (fasting 100 to 126 mg/dL, nonfasting 140 to 200 mg/dL). Patients taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients starting treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine alone, as well as olanzapine taken concomitantly with fluoxetine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose levels appears to fall on a continuum and olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics. Mean increases in blood glucose have been observed in patients treated (median exposure of 9.2 months) with olanzapine in phase 1 of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). The mean increase of serum glucose (fasting and nonfasting samples) from baseline to the average of the 2 highest serum concentrations was 15.0 mg/dL. In a study of healthy volunteers, subjects who received olanzapine (N=22) for 3 weeks had a mean increase compared to baseline in fasting blood glucose of 2.3 mg/dL. Placebo-treated subjects (N=19) had a mean increase in fasting blood glucose compared to baseline of 0.34 mg/dL. In an analysis of 7 controlled clinical studies, 2 of which were placebo-controlled, with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were associated with a greater mean change in random glucose compared to placebo (+8.65 mg/dL vs. -3.86 mg/dL). The difference in mean changes between olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and placebo was greater in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline (including those patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or related adverse reactions, patients treated with anti-diabetic agents, patients with a baseline random glucose level â‰¥200 mg/dL, or a baseline fasting glucose level â‰¥126 mg/dL). Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients had a greater mean HbA 1c increase from baseline of 0.15% (median exposure 63 days), compared to a mean HbA 1c decrease of 0.04% in fluoxetine-treated subjects (median exposure 57 days) and a mean HbA 1c increase of 0.12% in olanzapine-treated patients (median exposure 56 days). In an analysis of 6 controlled clinical studies, a larger proportion of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated subjects had glycosuria (4.4%) compared to placebo-treated subjects (1.4%). The mean change in nonfasting glucose in patients exposed at least 48 weeks was +5.9 mg/dL (N=425). Table 2 shows short-term and long-term changes in random glucose levels from adult olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule studies.

Controlled fasting glucose data is limited for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules; however, in an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (+2.76 mg/dL vs. +0.17 mg/dL). The mean change in fasting glucose for olanzapine-treated patients exposed at least 48 weeks was +4.2 mg/dL (N=487). In analyses of patients who completed 9 to 12 months of olanzapine therapy, mean change in fasting and nonfasting glucose levels continued to increase over time. Children and Adolescents â€” In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, there were no clinically meaningful differences observed between olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and placebo for mean change in fasting glucose levels. Table 4 shows categorical changes in fasting blood glucose from the pediatric olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules study.

Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents â€” In an analysis of 3 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies of adolescent patients, including those with Schizophrenia (6 weeks) or Bipolar I Disorder (manic or mixed episodes) (3 weeks), olanzapine was associated with a greater mean change from baseline in fasting glucose levels compared to placebo (+2.68 mg/dL vs -2.59 mg/dL). The mean change in fasting glucose for adolescents exposed at least 24 weeks was +3.1 mg/dL (N=121). Table 5 shows short-term and long-term changes in fasting blood glucose from adolescent olanzapine monotherapy studies.

Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule use. Clinical monitoring, including baseline and periodic follow-up lipid evaluations in patients using olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, is recommended. Adults â€” Clinically meaningful, and sometimes very high (>500 mg/dL), elevations in triglyceride levels have been observed with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule use. Clinically meaningful increases in total cholesterol have also been seen with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule use. In an analysis of 7 controlled clinical studies, 2 of which were placebo-controlled, with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients had an increase from baseline in mean random total cholesterol of 12.1 mg/dL compared to an increase from baseline in mean random total cholesterol of 4.8 mg/dL for olanzapine-treated patients and a decrease in mean random total cholesterol of 5.5 mg/dL for placebo-treated patients. Table 6 shows categorical changes in nonfasting lipid values. In long-term olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination studies (at least 48 weeks), changes (at least once) in nonfasting total cholesterol from normal at baseline to high occurred in 12% (N=150) and changes from borderline to high occurred in 56.6% (N=143) of patients. The mean change in nonfasting total cholesterol was 11.3 mg/dL (N=426).

Fasting lipid data is limited for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules; however, in an analysis of 5 placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies with treatment duration up to 12 weeks, olanzapine-treated patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.3 mg/dL, 3.0 mg/dL, and 20.8 mg/dL respectively compared to decreases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 6.1 mg/dL, 4.3 mg/dL, and 10.7 mg/dL for placebo-treated patients. For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapine-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline, where lipid dysregulation was defined as patients diagnosed with dyslipidemia or related adverse reactions, patients treated with lipid lowering agents, patients with high baseline lipid levels. In long-term olanzapine studies (at least 48 weeks), patients had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.6 mg/dL, 2.5 mg/dL, and 18.7 mg/dL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 0.16 mg/dL. In an analysis of patients who completed 12 months of therapy, the mean nonfasting total cholesterol did not increase further after approximately 4 to 6 months. The proportion of olanzapine-treated patients who had changes (at least once) in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol or triglycerides from normal or borderline to high, or changes in HDL cholesterol from normal or borderline to low, was greater in long-term studies (at least 48 weeks) as compared with short-term studies.

Children and Adolescents â€” In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, there were clinically meaningful and statistically significant differences observed between olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and placebo for mean change in fasting total cholesterol (+16.3 mg/dL vs. -4.3 mg/dL, respectively), LDL cholesterol (+9.7 mg/dL vs -3.5 mg/dL, respectively), and triglycerides (+35.4 mg/dL vs. -3.5 mg/dL, respectively). The magnitude and frequency of changes in lipids were greater in children and adolescents than previously observed in adults.

For fasting HDL cholesterol, no clinically meaningful differences were observed between olanzapine-treated adolescents and placebo-treated adolescents. In long-term olanzapine studies (at least 24 weeks), adolescents had increases from baseline in mean fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides of 5.5 mg/dL, 5.4 mg/dL, and 20.5 mg/dL, respectively, and a mean decrease in fasting HDL cholesterol of 4.5 mg/dL.

Weight Gain Potential consequences of weight gain should be considered prior to starting olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Patients receiving olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should receive regular monitoring of weight. Adults â€” In an analysis of 7 controlled clinical studies, 2 of which were placebo-controlled, the mean weight increase for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients was greater than placebo-treated patients [4 kg (8.8 lb) vs -0.3 kg (-0.7 lb)]. Twenty-two percent of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients gained at least 7% of their baseline weight, with a median exposure to event of 6 weeks. This was greater than in placebo-treated patients (1.8%). Approximately 3% of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients gained at least 15% of their baseline weight, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks. This was greater than in placebo-treated patients (0%). Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.5% of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. In long-term olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 6.7 kg (14.7 lb) (median exposure of 448 days, N=431). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15% or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 66%, 33%, and 10%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1.2% of patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination following at least 48 weeks of exposure. Table 11 presents the distribution of weight gain in a single long-term relapse prevention study of patients treated for up to 47 weeks with olanzapine and fluoxetine [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.2 )] Table 11: Weight Gain with Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Use in a Single Relapse Prevention Study in Adults Amount Gained kg (lb) Up to 8 Weeks (N=881) (%) Up to 20 Weeks (N=651) (%) Up to 47 Weeks (N=220) (%) â‰¤0 19.8 14.9 19.1 0 to â‰¤5 (0 to 11 lb) 64.1 47.2 37.7 >5 to â‰¤10 (11 to 22 lb) 15.1 30.3 27.7 >10 to â‰¤15 (22 to 33 lb) 0.9 5.8 10.0 >15 to â‰¤20 (33 to 44 lb) 0.1 1.2 3.2 >20 to â‰¤25 (44 to 55 lb) 0.0 0.6 1.4 >25 to â‰¤30 (55 to 66 lb) 0.0 0.0 0.5 >30 (>66 lb) 0.0 0.0 0.5 In long-term olanzapine studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 5.6 kg (12.3 lb) (median exposure of 573 days, N=2021). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 64%, 32%, and 12%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 0.4% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 48 weeks of exposure. Table 12 includes data on adult weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 86 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified.

In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (N=199), 20 (N=200) and 40 (N=200) mg/day of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, mean baseline to endpoint increase in weight (10 mg/day: 1.9 kg; 20 mg/day: 2.3 kg; 40 mg/day: 3 kg) was observed with significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day. Children and Adolescents â€” In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were associated with greater mean change in weight compared to placebo (+4.4 kg vs +0.5 kg, respectively). The percentages of children and adolescents who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with 8-week exposure were 52%, 14%, and 1%, respectively. The proportion of patients who had clinically significant weight gain was greater in children and adolescent patients compared to short-term data in adults. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.9% of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. Table 13 depicts weight gain observed in the pediatric olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule study. Table 13: Weight Gain with Olanzapine and FluoxetineÂ Capsules Use Seen in a Single Pediatric Study in Bipolar Depression Amount Gained kg (lb) Up to 8 Weeks (N=170) (%) â‰¤0 7.1 0 to â‰¤5 (0 to 11 lb) 54.7 >5 to â‰¤10 (11 to 22 lb) 31.2 >10 to â‰¤15 (22 to 33 lb) 7.1 >15 to â‰¤20 (33 to 44 lb) 0 >20 to â‰¤25 (44 to 55 lb) 0 >25 to â‰¤30 (55 to 66 lb) 0 >30 (>66 lb) 0 Olanzapine Monotherapy in Adolescents â€” Mean increase in weight in adolescents was greater than in adults. In 4 placebo-controlled trials, discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1% of olanzapine-treated patients, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Table 14: Weight Gain with Olanzapine Use in Adolescents from 4 Placebo-Controlled Trials Mean change in body weight from baseline (median exposure = 3 weeks) Olanzapine-treated patients Placebo-treated patients 4.6 kg (10.1 lb) 0.3 kg (0.7 lb) Percentage of patients who gained at least 7% of baseline body weight 40.6% (median exposure to 7% = 4 weeks) 9.8% (median exposure to 7% = 8 weeks) Percentage of patients who gained at least 15% of baseline body weight 7.1% (median exposure to 15% = 19 weeks) 2.7% (median exposure to 15% = 8 weeks) In long-term olanzapine studies (at least 24 weeks), the mean weight gain was 11.2 kg (24.6 lb) (median exposure of 201 days, N=179). The percentages of adolescents who gained at least 7%, 15%, or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 89%, 55%, and 29%, respectively. Among adolescent patients, mean weight gain by baseline BMI category was 11.5 kg (25.3 lb), 12.1 kg (26.6 lb), and 12.7 kg (27.9 lb), respectively, for normal (N=106), overweight (N=26) and obese (N=17). Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.2% of olanzapine-treated patients following at least 24 weeks of exposure. Table 15 shows data on adolescent weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 6 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified. Little clinical trial data is available on weight gain in adolescents with olanzapine beyond 6 months of treatment. Table 15: Weight Gain with Olanzapine Use in Adolescents Amount Gained kg (lb) 6 Weeks (N=243) (%) 6 Months (N=191) (%) â‰¤0 2.9 2.1 0 to â‰¤5 (0 to 11 lb) 47.3 24.6 >5 to â‰¤10 (11 to 22 lb) 42.4 26.7 >10 to â‰¤15 (22 to 33 lb) 5.8 22.0 >15 to â‰¤20 (33 to 44 lb) 0.8 12.6 >20 to â‰¤25 (44 to 55 lb) 0.8 9.4 >25 to â‰¤30 (55 to 66 lb) 0 2.1 >30 to â‰¤35 (66 to 77 lb) 0 0 >35 to â‰¤40 (77 to 88 lb) 0 0 >40 (>88 lb) 0 0.5 5.6 Serotonin Syndrome Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications ( . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. 4.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, discontinue olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications ( . 4.1 ) and Drug Interations ( 7.1 )] Monitor all patients taking olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.7 Angle-Closure Glaucoma Angle-Closure Glaucoma â€” The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. 5.8 Allergic Reactions and Rash In olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule premarketing controlled clinical studies, the overall incidence of rash or allergic reactions in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients [4.6% (26/571)] was similar to that of placebo [5.2% (25/477)]. The majority of the cases of rash and/or urticaria were mild; however, 3 patients discontinued (1 due to rash, which was moderate in severity and 2 due to allergic reactions, 1 of which included face edema). In fluoxetine US clinical studies, 7% of 10,782 fluoxetine-treated patients developed various types of rashes and/or urticaria. Among the cases of rash and/or urticaria reported in premarketing clinical studies, almost a third were withdrawn from treatment because of the rash and/or systemic signs or symptoms associated with the rash. Clinical findings reported in association with rash include fever, leukocytosis, arthralgias, edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, respiratory distress, lymphadenopathy, proteinuria, and mild transaminase elevation. Most patients improved promptly with discontinuation of fluoxetine and/or adjunctive treatment with antihistamines or steroids, and all patients experiencing these reactions were reported to recover completely. In fluoxetine premarketing clinical studies, 2 patients are known to have developed a serious cutaneous systemic illness. In neither patient was there an unequivocal diagnosis, but 1 was considered to have a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and the other, a severe desquamating syndrome that was considered variously to be a vasculitis or erythema multiforme. Other patients have had systemic syndromes suggestive of serum sickness. Since the introduction of fluoxetine, systemic reactions, possibly related to vasculitis, have developed in patients with rash. Although these reactions are rare, they may be serious, involving the lung, kidney, or liver. Death has been reported to occur in association with these systemic reactions. Anaphylactoid reactions, including bronchospasm, angioedema, and urticaria alone and in combination, have been reported. Pulmonary reactions, including inflammatory processes of varying histopathology and/or fibrosis, have been reported rarely. These reactions have occurred with dyspnea as the only preceding symptom. Whether these systemic reactions and rash have a common underlying cause or are due to different etiologies or pathogenic processes is not known. Furthermore, a specific underlying immunologic basis for these reactions has not been identified. Upon the appearance of rash or of other possible allergic phenomena for which an alternative etiology cannot be identified, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be discontinued. 5.9 Activation of Mania/Hypomania A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of Bipolar Disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a manic episode in patients at risk for Bipolar Disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described for clinical worsening and suicide risk represent such a conversion is unknown . However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for Bipolar Disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, Bipolar Disorder, and depression. It should be noted that olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are approved for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. In the 3 controlled bipolar depression studies (2 in adults and 1 in children and adolescents [10 to 17 years of age]) there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of manic reactions (manic reaction or manic depressive reaction) between olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule- and placebo-treated patients. In 1 adult study, the incidence of manic reactions was (7% [3/43]) in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared to (3% [5/184]) in placebo-treated patients. In the other adult study, the incidence of manic reactions was (2% [1/43]) in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared to (8% [15/193]) in placebo-treated patients. In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, the incidence of manic reactions was (1% [2/170]) in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared to (0% [0/84]) in placebo-treated patients. Because of the cyclical nature of Bipolar I Disorder, patients should be monitored closely for the development of symptoms of mania/hypomania during treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. 5.10 Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. The incidence of dyskinetic movement in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients was infrequent. The mean score on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-controlled database across clinical studies involving olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients decreased from baseline. Nonetheless, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the risk of tardive dyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules despite the presence of the syndrome. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. 5.11 Orthostatic Hypotension Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, bradycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period. In the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-controlled clinical trials across all indications, there were no significant differences between olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients and olanzapine, fluoxetine- or placebo-treated patients in exposure-adjusted rates of orthostatic systolic blood pressure decreases of at least 30 mm Hg. Orthostatic systolic blood pressure decreases of at least 30 mm Hg occurred in 4.0% (28/705), 2.3% (19/831), 4.5% (18/399), and 1.8% (8/442) of the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, olanzapine, fluoxetine, and placebo groups, respectively. In this group of studies, the incidence of syncope-related adverse reactions (i.e., syncope and/or loss of consciousness) in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients was 0.4% (3/771) compared to placebo 0.2% (1/477). In a clinical pharmacology study of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, 3 healthy subjects were discontinued from the trial after experiencing severe, but self-limited, hypotension and bradycardia that occurred 2 to 9 hours following a single 12 mg/50 mg dose of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Reactions consisting of this combination of hypotension and bradycardia (and also accompanied by sinus pause) have been observed in at least 3 other healthy subjects treated with various formulations of olanzapine (1 oral, 2 intramuscular). In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of patients with a â‰¥20 bpm decrease in orthostatic pulse concomitantly with a â‰¥20 mm Hg decrease in orthostatic systolic blood pressure was 0.3% (2/706) in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group, 0.2% (1/445) in the placebo group, 0.7% (6/837) in the olanzapine group, and 0% (0/404) in the fluoxetine group. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). 5.12 Falls Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.13 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis Class Effect â€” In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Agranulocytosis has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.14 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. 5.15 Seizures Seizures occurred in 0.2% (4/2547) of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients during open-label clinical studies. No seizures occurred in the controlled olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule studies. Seizures have also been reported with both olanzapine and fluoxetine monotherapy. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s dementia. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are not approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of â‰¥65 years of age. 5.16 Increased Risk of Bleeding SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, may increase the risk of bleeding reactions. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Bleeding reactions related to SNRIs and SSRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. 8.1 )] Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )] . 5.17 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia has been reported during treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine and olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported and appeared to be reversible when [see Use in Specific Populations ( Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were discontinued. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk. Discontinuation of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. 8.5 )]. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have been associated with hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. 5.18 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule therapy does not affect them adversely. Adults â€” Sedation-related adverse reactions were commonly reported with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule treatment occurring at an incidence of 26.6% in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared with 10.9% in placebo-treated patients. Sedation-related adverse reactions (sedation, somnolence, hypersomnia, and lethargy) led to discontinuation in 2% (15/771) of patients in the controlled clinical studies. Children and Adolescents â€” In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, somnolence-related adverse events were commonly reported with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule treatment occurring at an incidence of 23.5% in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared with 2.4% in placebo-treated patients. Somnolence-related adverse events led to discontinuation in 1.2% (2/170) of patients. 5.19 Body Temperature Dysregulation Disruption of the bodyâ€™s ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic drugs. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature (e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration). 5.20 QT Prolongation Post-marketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome; a previous history of QT prolongation; a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death; and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias; and conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure (overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs). Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Contraindications ( . 4.2 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.7 , 7.8 ), Overdosage ( 10.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.7 , 7.8 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] Consider ECG assessment and periodic ECG monitoring if initiating treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Consider discontinuing olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and obtaining a cardiac evaluation if patients develop signs or symptoms consistent with ventricular arrhythmia. In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, there was a statistically significant difference in QT c interval for patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules compared with patients on placebo: mean change in QT c F (Fridericia correction factor) from baseline to endpoint in patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules was 8.2 msec (95% CI 6.2, 10.2). No patient developed QT c increases â‰¥60 msec or QT c â‰¥480 msec. Clinicians should use olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules with caution in those children or adolescents who are known to be particularly at risk for QT prolongation [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.21 Anticholinergic\n(antimuscarinic) Effects The following precautions for the individual components may be applicable to olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Olanzapine exhibits in vitro muscarinic receptor affinity. In premarketing clinical studies, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were associated with constipation, dry mouth, and tachycardia, all adverse reactions possibly related to cholinergic antagonism. Such adverse reactions were not often the basis for study discontinuations; olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, constipation, a history of paralytic ileus, or related conditions. 5.22 Hyperprolactinemia As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D 2 receptors, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules elevate prolactin levels, and the elevation persists during administration. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and erectile dysfunction have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds that increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in the olanzapine carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( . 13.1 )] Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer. Adults â€” In controlled clinical studies of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 28% of adults treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules as compared to 5% of placebo-treated patients. The elevations persisted throughout administration of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 2929 adults treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events 1 (1% [20/1946] of females), sexual function-related events 2 (7% [192/2929] of females and males), and breast-related events 3 (0.8% [16/1946] of females, 0.2% [2/983] of males). Children and Adolescents â€” In a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were associated with a statistically significant greater mean change from baseline in prolactin levels compared to placebo (8.7Â mcg/L vs 0.7 mcg/L, respectively). Although prolactin concentrations were very commonly (>10%) elevated above normal in both the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and placebo groups, more than twice as many olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients were seen with these elevations compared to placebo-treated patients. Five patients experienced an adverse event potentially associated with elevated prolactin; these events included dysmenorrhea, galactorrhea, and ovulation disorder. The magnitude and frequency of change in prolactin in children and adolescents was larger than observed in adult patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, but was similar to that observed in adolescents treated with olanzapine monotherapy. Olanzapine Monotherapy In placebo-controlled olanzapine clinical studies (up to 12 weeks), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 30% of adults treated with olanzapine as compared to 10.5% of adults treated with placebo. In a pooled analysis from clinical studies including 8136 adults treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events 1 (2% [49/3240] of females), sexual function-related events 2 (2% [150/8136] of females and males), and breast-related events 3 (0.7% [23/3240] of females, 0.2% [9/4896] of males). In placebo-controlled olanzapine monotherapy studies in adolescent patients (up to 6 weeks) with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), changes from normal to high in prolactin concentrations were observed in 47% of olanzapine-treated patients compared to 7% of placebo-treated patients. In a pooled analysis from clinical trials including 454 adolescents treated with olanzapine, potentially associated clinical manifestations included menstrual-related events 1 (1% [2/168] of females), sexual function-related events 2 (0.7% [3/454] of females and males), and breast-related events 3 (2% [3/168] of females, 2% [7/286] of males), [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] 1 Based on a search of the following terms: amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menstruation delayed, and oligomenorrhea. 2 Based on a search of the following terms: anorgasmia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, loss of libido, abnormal orgasm, and sexual dysfunction. 3 Based on a search of the following terms: breast discharge, enlargement or swelling, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and lactation disorder. Dose group differences with respect to prolactin elevation have been observed. In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (n=199), 20 (n=200) and 40 (n=200) mg/day of oral olanzapine in adult patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, incidence of prolactin elevation >24.2 ng/mL (female) or >18.77 ng/mL (male) at any time during the trial (10 mg/day: 31.2%; 20 mg/day: 42.7%; 40 mg/day: 61.1%) indicated significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day and 20 vs 40 mg/day. 5.23 Concomitant Use of Olanzapine and Fluoxetine Products Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules contain the same active ingredients that are in Zyprexa Â® , Zyprexa Â® Zydis Â® , Zyprexa Â® Relprevv TM (olanzapine), and in Prozac Â® , and Sarafem Â® (fluoxetine HCl). Caution should be exercised when prescribing these medications concomitantly with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules [see Overdosage ( . 10 )] 5.24 Long Elimination Half-Life of Fluoxetine Because of the long elimination half-lives of fluoxetine and its major active metabolite, changes in dose will not be fully reflected in plasma for several weeks, affecting both strategies for titration to final dose and withdrawal from treatment. This is of potential consequence when drug discontinuation is required or when drugs are prescribed that might interact with fluoxetine and norfluoxetine following the discontinuation of fluoxetine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.3 )] 5.25 Discontinuation Adverse Reactions During marketing of fluoxetine, a component of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, SNRIs, and SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these reactions are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluoxetine. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. Plasma fluoxetine and norfluoxetine concentration decrease gradually at the conclusion of therapy, which may minimize the risk of discontinuation symptoms with this drug [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 )] 5.26 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including fluoxetine a component of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions ( . In male patients, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. 6.1) ] It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.",

Children and adolescents: sedation, weight increased, appetite increased, tremor, triglyceride increased, hepatic enzymes increased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva atÂ  1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice. The data in the tables represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adults â€” The information below is derived from a clinical study database for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules consisting of 2547 patients with treatment resistant depression, depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with psychosis, or sexual dysfunction with approximately 1085 patient-years of exposure. The conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term or long-term exposure. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Controlled Studies Including Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder and Treatment Resistant Depression â€” Overall, 11.3% of the 771 patients in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group discontinued due to adverse reactions compared with 4.4% of the 477 patients for placebo. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation associated with the use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules (incidence of at least 1% for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and greater than that for placebo) using MedDRA Dictionary coding were weight increased (2%) and sedation (1%) versus placebo patients which had 0% incidence of weight increased and sedation. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Controlled Studies Including Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder and Treatment Resistant Depression â€” In short-term studies, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules (incidence â‰¥5% and at least twice that for placebo in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-controlled database) using MedDRA Dictionary coding were: disturbance in attention, dry mouth, fatigue, hypersomnia, increased appetite, peripheral edema, sedation, somnolence, tremor, vision blurred, and weight increased. Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials of olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination are generally consistent with treatment-emergent adverse reactions during olanzapine or fluoxetine monotherapy. In a 47-week maintenance study in adults with treatment resistant depression, adverse reactions associated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule use were generally similar to those seen in short-term studies. Weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia were observed in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule -treated patients throughout the study. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in Short-Term Controlled Studies Including Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder and Treatment Resistant Depression â€” Table 16 enumerates the treatment-emergent adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules (incidence of at least 2% for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and twice or more than for placebo). The olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-controlled column includes patients with various diagnoses while the placebo column includes only patients with bipolar depression and major depression with psychotic features.

Extrapyramidal Symptoms Dystonia, Class Effect for Antipsychotics â€” Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, the frequency and severity are greater with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. In general, an elevated risk of acute dystonia may be observed in males and younger age groups receiving antipsychotics; however, events of dystonia have been reported infrequently (<1%) with the olanzapine and fluoxetine combination. Additional Findings Observed in Clinical Studies Sexual Dysfunction â€” In the pool of controlled olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule studies in patients with bipolar depression, there were higher rates of the treatment-emergent adverse reactions decreased libido, anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction and abnormal ejaculation in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group than in the placebo group. One case of decreased libido led to discontinuation in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group. In the controlled studies that contained a fluoxetine arm, the rates of decreased libido and abnormal ejaculation in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group were less than the rates in the fluoxetine group. None of the differences were statistically significant. Sexual dysfunction, including priapism, has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, healthcare providers should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule or fluoxetine treatment. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction occasionally persist after discontinuation of fluoxetine treatment. Difference Among Dose Levels Observed in Other Olanzapine Clinical Trials In a single 8-week randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing 10 (N=199), 20 (N=200), and 40 (N=200) mg/day of olanzapine in patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder, statistically significant differences among 3 dose groups were observed for the following safety outcomes: weight gain, prolactin elevation, fatigue, and dizziness. Mean baseline to endpoint increase in weight (10 mg/day: 1.9 kg; 20 mg/day: 2.3 kg; 40 mg/day: 3 kg) was observed with significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day. Incidence of treatment-emergent prolactin elevation >24.2 ng/mL (female) or >18.77 ng/mL (male) at any time during the trial (10 mg/day: 31.2%; 20 mg/day: 42.7%; 40 mg/day: 61.1%) with significant differences between 10 vs 40 mg/day and 20 vs 40 mg/day; fatigue (10 mg/day: 1.5%; 20 mg/day: 2.1%; 40 mg/day: 6.6%) with significant differences between 10 vs 40 and 20 vs 40 mg/day; and dizziness (10 mg/day: 2.6%; 20 mg/day: 1.6%; 40 mg/day: 6.6%) with significant differences between 20 vs 40 mg, was observed. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules in clinical trials. This listing is not intended to include reactions (1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, (2) for which a drug cause was remote, (3) which were so general as to be uninformative, (4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or (5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Reactions are classified by body system using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; and rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients. Body as a Whole â€” Frequent: chills, neck rigidity, photosensitivity reaction; Rare: death 1 . Cardiovascular System â€” Frequent: vasodilatation. Digestive System â€” Frequent: diarrhea; Infrequent: gastritis, gastroenteritis, nausea and vomiting, peptic ulcer; Rare: gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, liver fatty deposit, pancreatitis. Hemic and Lymphatic System â€” Frequent: ecchymosis; Infrequent: anemia, thrombocytopenia; Rare: leukopenia, purpura. Metabolic and Nutritional â€” Frequent: generalized edema, weight loss; Rare: bilirubinemia, creatinine increased, gout. Musculoskeletal System â€” Rare: osteoporosis. Nervous System â€” Frequent: amnesia; Infrequent: ataxia, buccoglossal syndrome, coma, depersonalization, dysarthria, emotional lability, euphoria, hypokinesia, movement disorder, myoclonus; Rare: hyperkinesia, libido increased, withdrawal syndrome. Respiratory System â€” Infrequent: epistaxis, yawn; Rare: laryngismus. Skin and Appendages â€” Infrequent: alopecia, dry skin, pruritus; Rare: exfoliative dermatitis. Special Senses â€” Frequent: taste perversion; Infrequent: abnormality of accommodation, dry eyes. Urogenital System â€” Frequent: breast pain, menorrhagia 2 , urinary frequency, urinary incontinence; Infrequent: amenorrhea 2 , female lactation 2 , hypomenorrhea 2 , metrorrhagia 2 , urinary retention, urinary urgency, urination impaired; Rare: breast engorgement 2 . 1 This term represents a serious adverse event but does not meet the definition for adverse drug reactions. It is included here because of its seriousness. 2 Adjusted for gender. Other Adverse Reactions Observed with Olanzapine or Fluoxetine Monotherapy The following adverse reactions were not observed in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients during premarketing clinical studies but have been reported with olanzapine or fluoxetine monotherapy: Bruxism, dysuria, esophageal ulcer, gynecological bleeding, headache, hypotension, neutropenia, sudden unexpected death 3 and sweating. 3 These terms represent serious adverse events but do not meet the definition for adverse drug reactions. They are included here because of their seriousness. Children and Adolescent Patients (aged 10 to 17 years) with a Diagnosis of Bipolar Depression The information below is derived from a single, 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for the treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in the single pediatric study â€” Overall, 14.1% of the 170 patients in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group discontinued due to adverse reactions compared with 5.9% of the 85 patients for placebo. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation associated with the use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules (incidence of at least 1% for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and greater than that for placebo) using MedDRA Dictionary coding were weight increased (2.9%), suicidal ideation (1.8%), bipolar disorder (1.2%), and somnolence (1.2%) versus placebo patients which had 0% incidence of weight increased, bipolar disorder, and somnolence, and a 1.2% incidence of suicidal ideation. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or more and greater than placebo â€” Table 17 enumerates the treatment-emergent adverse reactions associated with the use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules (incidence of at least 2% for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and twice or more than for placebo). Table 17: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions: Incidence in a 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in pediatric bipolar I depression.

No lethargy was reported. b Includes alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, hepatic enzyme increased, liver function test abnormal, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, and transaminases increased. Vital Signs and Laboratory Studies Adults: Vital Signs â€” Tachycardia, bradycardia, and orthostatic hypotension have occurred in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( . The mean standing pulse rate of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients was reduced by 0.7 beats/min. 5.11 )] Laboratory Changes â€” In olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule clinical studies (including treatment resistant depression, depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with psychosis, or sexual dysfunction), olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were associated with statistically significantly greater frequencies for the following treatment-emergent findings in laboratory analytes (normal at baseline to abnormal at any time during the trial) compared to placebo: elevated prolactin (28% vs 5%); elevated urea nitrogen (3% vs 0.8%); elevated uric acid (3% vs 0.5%); low albumin (3% vs 0.3%); low bicarbonate (14% vs 9%); low hemoglobin (3% vs 0%); low inorganic phosphorus (2% vs 0.3%); low lymphocytes (2% vs 0%); and low total bilirubin (15% vs 4%). As with olanzapine, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic aminotransferases [ALT, AST, and GGT] and alkaline phosphatase have been observed with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. In the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-controlled database, clinically significant ALT elevations (change from <3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] at baseline to â‰¥3 times ULN) were observed in 5% (38/698) of patients exposed to olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules compared with 0.5% (2/378) of placebo-treated patients and 4% (33/751) of olanzapine-treated patients. ALT elevations â‰¥5 times ULN were observed in 2% (11/701) of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients, compared to 0.3% (1/379) of placebo-treated patients and 1% (11/760) of olanzapine-treated patients. No patient with elevated ALT values experienced jaundice or liver failure, or met the criteria for Hyâ€™s Rule. ALT values returned to normal, or were decreasing, at last follow-up in the majority of patients who either continued treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules or discontinued olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Rare postmarketing reports of hepatitis have been received in patients treated with olanzapine. Very rare cases of cholestatic or mixed liver injury have also been reported in the postmarketing period in patients treated with olanzapine. Caution should be exercised in patients with signs and symptoms of hepatic impairment, in patients with pre-existing conditions associated with limited hepatic functional reserve, and in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic drugs. An increase in creatine phosphokinase has been reported very rarely in olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients and infrequently in clinical trials of olanzapine-treated patients. QT Interval Prolongation â€” In patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules QT c Fâ‰¥450 msec for males and QT c Fâ‰¥470 msec for females has been reported frequently (â‰¥1%). The incidence of QT c F>500 msec associated with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule treatment in clinical trials has been rare and was not significantly different from the incidence associated with placebo. The mean increase in QT c interval for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients (5.17 msec) in the one clinical study directly comparing olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules to placebo in adult patients was significantly greater than that for placebo-treated patients (-1.66 msec). Children and Adolescents (aged 10 to 17 years): In a single 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules for treatment of bipolar I depression in patients 10 to 17 years of age, the following was observed: Vital Signs â€” In the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients, the mean orthostatic blood pressure and standing pulse rate were not significantly different between treatment groups. Body Weight: An increase in weight greater than or equal to 7% occurred in 52.4% of the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group and 3.6% of the placebo group. Weight gain greater than or equal to 15% occurred in 14.1% of the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group and none of the placebo group. Laboratory Changes â€” Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were associated with statistically significantly greater frequencies for the following treatment-emergent findings in laboratory analytes (normal or low at baseline to abnormal at any time during the trial) compared to placebo: elevated ALT (45.9% vs 2.5%); elevated AST (33.7% vs 7.6%); high fasting total cholesterol (28.9% vs 8.2%); high fasting LDL cholesterol (19.7% vs 6.5%); high fasting triglycerides (52.3% vs 27.3%), and elevated prolactin (85% vs 36%). No patient with elevated hepatic enzyme values experienced jaundice or liver failure, or met the criteria for Hyâ€™s Rule. Five patients experienced an adverse event potentially associated with elevated prolactin; these events included dysmenorrhea, galactorrhea, and ovulation disorder. QT Interval Prolongation â€” Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules were associated with a statistically significantly greater mean increase in QT c F interval (8.2 msec [95% CI 6.2, 10.2]) compared with placebo. No patients developed QT c increases â‰¥60 msec or QT c â‰¥480 msec [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.20 )] 6.2 Postmarketing\nExperience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules, Fluoxetine, or Olanzapine monotherapy. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally (but not necessarily causally) related to olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule, fluoxetine, or olanzapine therapy include the following: Olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules : rhabdomyolysis and venous thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis) Fluoxetine : anosmia, aplastic anemia, cholestatic jaundice, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), eosinophilic pneumonia 3 , erythema multiforme, violent behavior 3 , atrial fibrillation 3 , cataract, cerebrovascular accident 3 , epidermal necrolysis, erythema nodosum, heart arrest 3 , hepatic failure/necrosis, hypoglycemia, hyposmia, kidney failure, memory impairment, optic neuritis, pulmonary hypertension, Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Olanzapine : diabetic coma, jaundice, random triglyceride levels of â‰¥1000 mg/dL, restless legs syndrome, stuttering 4 , salivary hypersecretion, allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylactoid reaction, angioedema, pruritus or urticaria), diabetic ketoacidosis, discontinuation reaction (diaphoresis, nausea or vomiting), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), fecal incontinence, and somnambulism . 3 These terms represent serious adverse events but do not meet the definition for adverse drug reactions. They are included here because of their seriousness. 4 Stuttering was only studied in oral and long acting injection (LAI) olanzapine formulations."
