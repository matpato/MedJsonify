    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Postural hypotension/syncope: Care should be taken in patients with symptomatic hypotension or who have had a hypotensive response to other medications or are concomitantly treated with antihypertensive medication or nitrates ( 5.1 ) Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) ( 5.2 , 8.6 , 12.3 ) Use with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( 5.3 , 8.7 , 12.3 ) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic antagonists ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) Prostate carcinoma should be ruled out prior to treatment ( 5.5 ) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) during cataract surgery may require modifications to the surgical technique ( 5.6) Discontinue alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if symptoms of angina pectoris appear or worsen ( 5.8 ) Use with caution in patients with a history of QT prolongation or who are taking medications which prolong the QT interval ( 5.9 , 12.2 ) 5.1 Postural Hypotension Postural hypotension with or without symptoms (e.g., dizziness) may develop within a few hours following administration of alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. As with other alpha-adrenergic antagonists, there is a potential for syncope. Patients should be warned of the possible occurrence of such events and should avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur. There may be an increased risk of hypotension/postural hypotension and syncope when taking alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets concomitantly with anti-hypertensive medication and nitrates. Care should be taken when alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are administered to patients with symptomatic hypotension or patients who have had a hypotensive response to other medications. 5.2 Patients with Renal Impairment Caution should be exercised when alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are administered in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( ]. 8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) 5.3 Patients with Hepatic Impairment Alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated for use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications ( ]. Although the pharmacokinetics of alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have not been studied in patients with mild hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised when alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are administered to such patients [ 4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) see Use in Specific Populations ( ]. 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) 5.4  Drug-Drug Interactions Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors Alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated for use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) since alfuzosin blood levels are increased [ see Contraindications ( ]. 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) Other alpha-adrenergic antagonists Alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are an alpha-adrenergic antagonist and should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic antagonist [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7.2 ) Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) Inhibitors PDE5-inhibitors are also vasodilators. Caution is advised for concomitant use of PDE5-inhibitors and alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, as this combination can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7.4) 5.5 Prostatic Carcinoma Carcinoma of the prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) cause many of the same symptoms. These two diseases frequently coexist. Therefore, patients thought to have BPH should be examined to rule out the presence of carcinoma of the prostate prior to starting treatment with alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.6 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) IFIS has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha adrenergic antagonists. This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient’s ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. There does not appear to be a benefit of stopping alpha adrenergic antagonist therapy prior to cataract surgery. 5.7 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000), alfuzosin, like other alpha-adrenergic antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients should be advised about the seriousness of the condition [ see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17.3)] 5.8 Coronary Insufficiency If symptoms of angina pectoris should appear or worsen, alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued. 5.9 Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation Use with caution in patients with acquired or congenital QT prolongation or who are taking medications that prolong the QT interval [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies (incidence ≥2% and at a higher incidence than placebo): dizziness, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800- 706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The incidence of adverse reactions has been ascertained from 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials involving 1,608 men where daily doses of 10 and 15 mg alfuzosin were evaluated. In these 3 trials, 473 men received alfuzosin hydrochloride 10 mg extended-release tablets. In these trials, 4% of patients taking alfuzosin hydrochloride 10 mg extended-release tablets withdrew from the trial due to adverse reactions, compared with 3% in the placebo group. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of patients receiving alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and at a higher incidence than that of the placebo group. In general, the adverse reactions seen in long-term use were similar in type and frequency to the events described below for the 3-month trials. Table 1 — Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥2% of Alfuzosin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets-Treated Patients and More Frequently than with Placebo in 3-Month Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse Reaction Placebo (n=678) Alfuzosin hydrochloride (n=473) Dizziness 19 (2.8%) 27 (5.7%) Upper respiratory tract infection 4 (0.6%) 14 (3.0%) Headache 12 (1.8%) 14 (3.0%) Fatigue 12 (1.8%) 13 (2.7%) The following adverse reactions, reported by between 1% and 2% of patients receiving alfuzosin hydrochloride and occurring more frequently than with placebo, are listed alphabetically by body system and by decreasing frequency within body system: Body as a whole: pain Gastrointestinal system: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, nausea Reproductive system: impotence Respiratory system: bronchitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis Signs and Symptoms of Orthostasis in Clinical Trials: The adverse reactions related to orthostasis that occurred in the double-blind phase 3 trials with alfuzosin 10 mg are summarized in Table 2. Approximately 20% to 30% of patients in these trials were taking antihypertensive medication. Table 2— Number (%) of Patients with Symptoms Possibly Associated with Orthostasis in 3-Month Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Symptoms Placebo (n=678) Alfuzosin hydrochloride (n=473) Dizziness 19 (2.8%) 27 (5.7%) Hypotension or postural hypotension 0 2 (0.4%) Syncope 0 1 (0.2%) Testing for blood pressure changes or orthostatic hypotension was conducted in three controlled studies. Decreased systolic blood pressure (≤90 mm Hg, with a decrease ≥20 mm Hg from baseline) was observed in none of the 674 placebo patients and 1 (0.2%) of the 469 alfuzosin hydrochloride patients. Decreased diastolic blood pressure (≤50 mm Hg, with a decrease ≥15 mm Hg from baseline) was observed in 3 (0.4%) of the placebo patients and in 4 (0.9%) of the alfuzosin hydrochloride patients. A positive orthostatic test (decrease in systolic blood pressure of ≥20 mm Hg upon standing from the supine position) was seen in 52 (7.7%) of placebo patients and in 31 (6.6%) of the alfuzosin hydrochloride patients. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of alfuzosin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General disorders edema tachycardia, chest pain, angina pectoris in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation Cardiac disorders Gastrointestinal disorders diarrhea, vomiting Hepatobiliary disorders hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury (including cases with jaundice leading to drug discontinuation) Respiratory system disorders rhinitis Reproductive system disorders priapism Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders rash, pruritis, urticaria, angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis flushing Vascular disorders Blood and lymphatic system disorders thrombocytopenia During cataract surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in some patients on or previously treated with alpha adrenergic antagonists [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]."
