    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions: (5.1) • Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis and hepatotoxicity, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, and immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction. • Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. • Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity and type of reaction. (2.3) • Infusion-related reactions: Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue OPDIVO based on severity of reaction. (5.2) • Complications of allogeneic HSCT: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. (5.3) • Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. (5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3) • Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. (5.5) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions OPDIVO is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD‑1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue OPDIVO depending on severity [see . In general, if OPDIVO requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis OPDIVO can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis, which is defined as requiring use of steroids and no clear alternate etiology. In patients treated with other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, the incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. OPDIVO as a Single Agent Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.1% (61/1994) of patients receiving OPDIVO as a single agent, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (2.1%) adverse reactions. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 1.1% and withholding of OPDIVO in 0.8% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% (61/61) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 84% of the 61 patients. Of the 15 patients in whom OPDIVO was withheld for pneumonitis, 14 reinitiated OPDIVO after symptom improvement; of these, 4 (29%) had recurrence of pneumonitis. OPDIVO with Ipilimumab OPDIVO 3 mg/kg with Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg: In NSCLC, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 9% (50/576) of patients receiving OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks, including Grade 4 (0.5%), Grade 3 (3.5%), and Grade 2 (4%) immune-mediated pneumonitis. Four patients (0.7%) died due to pneumonitis. Immune-mediated pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 5% of patients and withholding of OPDIVO with ipilimumab in 3.6% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 100% of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 72% of the patients.

Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause) [see . These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, OPDIVO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of nivolumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased abortion and premature infant death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OPDIVO and for 5 months after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] 5.5 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when OPDIVO Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In randomized clinical trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of a PD-1 blocking antibody, including OPDIVO, to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.",

The data in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to OPDIVO as a single agent in 1994 patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-037, CHECKMATE-017, CHECKMATE-057, CHECKMATE-066, CHECKMATE-025, CHECKMATE-067, CHECKMATE-205, CHECKMATE-039 or a single-arm trial in NSCLC (n=117); OPDIVO 1 mg/kg with ipilimumab 3 mg/kg in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-067 (n=313), CHECKMATE-040 (n=49), or another randomized trial (n=94); OPDIVO 3 mg/kg administered with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n=666) in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-214 or CHECKMATE-142; OPDIVO 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-227 (n=576) or CHECKMATE-743 (n=300); OPDIVO 360 mg with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg and 2 cycles of platinum-doublet chemotherapy in CHECKMATE-9LA (n=361); and OPDIVO 240 mg with cabozantinib 40 mg in patients enrolled in CHECKMATE-9ER (n=320). Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma Previously Treated Metastatic Melanoma The safety of OPDIVO was evaluated in CHECKMATE-037, a randomized, open-label trial in 370 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see . Patients had documented disease progression following treatment with ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, prior ipilimumab-related Grade 4 adverse reactions (except for endocrinopathies) or Grade 3 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not resolved or were inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event, patients with a condition requiring chronic systemic treatment with corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, a positive test for hepatitis B or C, and a history of HIV. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (n=268) or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (n=102): dacarbazine 1000 mg/m Clinical Studies (14.1) ] 2 intravenously every 3 weeks or carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. The median duration of exposure was 5.3 months (range: 1 day to 13.8+ months) in OPDIVO-treated patients and was 2 months (range: 1 day to 9.6+ months) in chemotherapy-treated patients. In this ongoing trial, 24% of patients received OPDIVO for >6 months and 3% of patients received OPDIVO for >1 year. The population characteristics in the OPDIVO group and the chemotherapy group were similar: 66% male, median age 59.5 years, 98% White, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), 74% with M1c stage disease, 73% with cutaneous melanoma, 11% with mucosal melanoma, 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease, and 18% had brain metastasis. There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline (51% vs. 38%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. OPDIVO was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of patients. Twenty-six percent of patients receiving OPDIVO had a dose interruption for an adverse reaction. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in 2% to <5% of patients receiving OPDIVO were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and increased lipase. The most common adverse reaction (reported in ≥20% of patients) was rash. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in CHECKMATE-037. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥10% of OPDIVO-Treated Patients and at a Higher Incidence than in the Chemotherapy Arm (Between Arm Difference of ≥5% All Grades or ≥2% Grades 3-4) - CHECKMATE-037 Toxicity was graded per NCI CTCAE v4. a Includes maculopapular rash, erythematous rash, pruritic rash, follicular rash, macular rash, papular rash, pustular rash, vesicular rash, and acneiform dermatitis. b Includes rhinitis, pharyngitis, and nasopharyngitis.

There were more patients in the OPDIVO group with ECOG performance status 0 (71% vs. 59%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36% of patients receiving OPDIVO. Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of OPDIVO in 7% of patients and dose interruption in 26% of patients; no single type of adverse reaction accounted for the majority of OPDIVO discontinuations. Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving OPDIVO. The most frequent Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients receiving OPDIVO were increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (3.9%) and diarrhea (3.4%). The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients and at a higher incidence than in the dacarbazine arm) were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, and pruritus.

Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to OPDIVO was 10.3 months (range: 1 day to 22.3 months). Clinical Studies (14.4) ] The study population characteristics were: median age 66 years (range: 35 - 86); 71% male; 72% White, 25% Asian, 1.7% Black/African American, and 1.5% other race; and 6% Hispanic or Latino. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with resectable NSCLC receiving OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy, given as neoadjuvant treatment and followed as a single agent adjuvant treatment after surgery, were generally similar to those occurring in patients in other clinical trials across tumor types receiving OPDIVO in combination with chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant Phase of CHECKMATE-77T A total of 228 patients received at least 1 dose of OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and 230 patients received at least 1 dose of placebo in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients who received OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment; the most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions was pneumonia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.2% of patients, due to cerebrovascular accident, COVID-19 infection, hemoptysis, pneumonia, and pneumonitis (0.4% each). Permanent discontinuation of any study drug due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of patients who received OPDIVO in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment; the most frequent (≥1%) adverse reaction that led to permanent discontinuation of any study drug was peripheral sensory neuropathy (2.2%). Of the 228 OPDIVO-treated patients and 230 placebo-treated patients who received neoadjuvant treatment, 5.3% (n=12) and 3.5% (n=8), respectively, did not receive surgery due to adverse reactions. The adverse reactions that led to cancellation of surgery in OPDIVO-treated patients were cerebrovascular accident, pneumonia, and colitis/diarrhea (2 patients each) and acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, hemoptysis, pneumonitis, COVID-19, and myositis (1 patient each). Of the 178 OPDIVO-treated patients who received surgery, 4.5% (n=8) experienced delay of surgery (surgery more than 6 weeks from last neoadjuvant treatment) due to adverse reactions. Of the 178 placebo-treated patients who received surgery, 3.9% (n=7) experienced delay of surgery due to adverse reactions. Of the 178 OPDIVO-treated patients who received surgery, 7% (n=13) did not receive adjuvant treatment due to adverse reactions. Of the 178 placebo-treated patients who received surgery, 2.8% (n=5) did not receive adjuvant treatment due to adverse reactions. Adjuvant Phase of CHECKMATE-77T A total of 142 patients in the OPDIVO arm and 152 patients in the placebo arm received at least 1 dose of adjuvant treatment. Of the patients who received single agent OPDIVO as adjuvant treatment, 22% experienced serious adverse reactions; the most frequent serious adverse reaction was pneumonitis/ILD (2.8%). One fatal adverse reaction due to COVID-19 occurred. Permanent discontinuation of adjuvant OPDIVO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients; the most frequent (≥1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation of adjuvant OPDIVO were pneumonitis (4.2%) and diarrhea (1.4%). Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC: In Combination with Ipilimumab The safety of OPDIVO in combination with ipilimumab was evaluated in CHECKMATE-227, a randomized, multicenter, multi-cohort, open-label trial in patients with previously untreated metastatic or recurrent NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations [see . The trial excluded patients with untreated brain metastases, carcinomatous meningitis, active autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression. Patients received OPDIVO 3 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 6 weeks or platinum-doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. The median duration of therapy in OPDIVO and ipilimumab-treated patients was 4.2 months (range: 1 day to 25.5 months): 39% of patients received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for >6 months and 23% of patients received OPDIVO and ipilimumab for >1 year. The population characteristics were: median age 64 years (range: 26 to 87); 48% were ≥65 years of age, 76% White, and 67% male. Baseline ECOG performance status was 0 (35%) or 1 (65%), 85% were former/current smokers, 11% had brain metastases, 28% had squamous histology and 72% had non-squamous histology. Clinical Studies (14.5) ] Serious adverse reactions occurred in 58% of patients. OPDIVO and ipilimumab were discontinued for adverse reactions in 24% of patients and 53% had at least one dose withheld for an adverse reaction. The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, diarrhea/colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, pulmonary embolism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypophysitis. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.7% of patients; these included events of pneumonitis (4 patients), myocarditis, acute kidney injury, shock, hyperglycemia, multi-system organ failure, and renal failure. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions were fatigue, rash, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea/colitis, dyspnea, cough, hepatitis, nausea, and pruritus.
