    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Moxifloxacin tablets are a fluoroquinolone antibacterial indicated for treating infections in adults 18 years of age and older caused by designated susceptible bacteria, in the conditions listed below: Community Acquired Pneumonia ( 1.1 ) Skin and Skin Structure Infections: Uncomplicated ( 1.2 ) and Complicated ( 1.3 ) Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections ( 1.4 ) Plague ( 1.5 ) Acute Bacterial Sinusitis ( 1.6 ) Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis ( 1.7 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and other antibacterial drugs. Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. ( 1.8 ) 1.1 Community Acquired Pneumonia Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Community Acquired Pneumonia caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae [MDRSP]), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Chlamydophila pneumoniae [see . Clinical Studies (14.3)] MDRSP isolates are isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibacterial drugs: penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC]≥ 2 mcg/mL), 2 nd generation cephalosporins (for example, cefuroxime), macrolides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. 1.2 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by susceptible isolates of methicillin- susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. 1.3 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by susceptible isolates of methicillin- susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Enterobacter cloacae [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. 1.4 Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections (cIAI) including polymicrobial infections such as abscess caused by susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, or Peptostreptococcus species [see Clinical Studies (14.6)] . 1.5 Plague Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to susceptible isolates of Yersinia pestis and prophylaxis of plague in adult patients. Efficacy studies of moxifloxacin could not be conducted in humans with plague for feasibility reasons. Therefore this indication is based on an efficacy study conducted in animals only [see Clinical Studies (14.7)]. 1.6 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients (18 years of age and older) for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Sinusitis (ABS) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see and for some patients ABS is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin tablets for treatment of ABS in patients who have no alternative treatment options. - Warnings and Precautions (5.1 )] 5.13 1.7 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis Moxifloxacin tablets are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB) caused by susceptible isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis [see . Clinical Studies (14.2 )] Because fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see and for some patients ABECB is self-limiting, reserve moxifloxacin tablets for treatment of ABECB in patients who have no alternative treatment options. Warnings and Precautions (5.1 - 5.13 )] 1.8 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and other antibacterial drugs, moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Moxifloxacin hydrochloride is contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or any member of the quinolone class of antibacterials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Known hypersensitivity to Moxifloxacin hydrochloride or other quinolones ( 4 , 5.8 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Prolongation of the QT interval and isolated cases of torsade de pointes has been reported. Avoid use in patients with known prolongation, proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and with drugs that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.6 , 7.5 , 8.5 ) Hypersensitivity and other serious reactions: Serious and sometimes fatal reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, may occur after first or subsequent doses of moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride at first sign of skin rash, jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity. ( 5.7 , 5.8 ) Clostridium difficile -Associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Disabling and Potentially Irreversible Serious Adverse Reactions Including Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture, Peripheral Neuropathy, and Central Nervous System Effects Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with disabling and potentially irreversible serious adverse reactions from different body systems that can occur together in the same patient. Commonly seen adverse reactions include tendinitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects (hallucinations, anxiety, depression, insomnia, severe headaches, and confusion). These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after starting moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Patients of any age or without pre-existing risk factors have experienced these adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 )]. Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately at the first signs or symptoms of any serious adverse reaction. In addition, avoid the use of fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, in patients who have experienced any of these serious adverse reactions associated with fluoroquinolones. 5.2 Tendinitis and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages [see . This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur within hours or days of starting moxifloxacin or as long as several months after completion of therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or who have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and may be irreversible in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2 )]. Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, tingling, numbness, and/or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch, pain, temperature, position sense, and vibratory sensation. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, in patients who have previously experienced peripheral neuropathy. 5.4 Central Nervous System Effects Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with an increased risk of psychiatric adverse reactions, including: toxic psychosis, hallucinations, or paranoia; depression or suicidal thoughts or acts; anxiety, agitation, or nervousness; confusion, delirium, disorientation, or disturbances in attention; insomnia or nightmares; memory impairment. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving moxifloxacin hydrochloride, discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate measures [ . see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2 )] Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been associated with an increased risk of seizures (convulsions), increased intracranial pressure (including pseudotumor cerebri), dizziness, and tremors. As with all fluoroquinolones, use moxifloxacin hydrochloride with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders (for example, severe cerebral arteriosclerosis, epilepsy) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold. These adverse reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving moxifloxacin hydrochloride, discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately and institute appropriate measures [ see Drug Interactions (7.4) Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.5 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. Postmarketing serious adverse reactions, including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support, have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in patients with myasthenia gravis. Avoid moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis. 5.6 QT Prolongation Moxifloxacin hydrochloride has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients. Following oral dosing with 400 mg of moxifloxacin hydrochloride the mean (± SD) change in QTc from the pre-dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec (± 26) (n = 787). Following a course of daily intravenous dosing (400 mg; 1 hour infusion each day) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre-dose value was 10 msec (±22) on Day 1 (n=667) and 7 msec (± 24) on Day 3 (n = 667). Avoid moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients with the following risk factors due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations: • Known prolongation of the QT interval • Ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes because QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for these conditions • Ongoing proarrhythmic conditions, such as clinically significant bradycardia and acute myocardial ischemia, • Uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia • Class IA (for example, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (for example, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents • Other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride, erythromycin, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants Elderly patients using intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride may be more susceptible to drug-associated QT prolongation [see Use In Specific Populations (8.5)] . In patients with mild, moderate, or severe liver cirrhosis, metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency may lead to QT prolongation. Monitor ECG in patients with liver cirrhosis treated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride [see The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation. Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In premarketing clinical trials, the rate of cardiovascular adverse reactions was similar in 798 moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval. No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with moxifloxacin hydrochloride treatment in over 15,500 patients in controlled clinical studies, including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment, and there was no increase in mortality in over 18,000 moxifloxacin tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed. 5.7 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. These reactions may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: • Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) • Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness • Allergic pneumonitis • Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure • Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure • Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and institute supportive measures. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 5.9 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.10 Arthropathic Effects in Animals In immature dogs, oral administration of moxifloxacin hydrochloride caused lameness. Histopathological examination of the weight-bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage. Related quinolone-class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. 5.11 Blood Glucose Disturbances As with all fluoroquinolones, disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported with moxifloxacin hydrochloride. In moxifloxacin hydrochloride-treated patients, dysglycemia occurred predominantly in elderly diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent (for example, sulfonylurea) or with insulin. Severe cases of hypoglycemia resulting in coma or death have been reported. In diabetic patients, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride and  initiate appropriate therapy immediately [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Drug Interactions (7.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 5.12 Photosensitivity/Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions, the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions (for example, burning, erythema, exudation, vesicles, blistering, edema) involving areas exposed to light (typically the face, “V” area of the neck, extensor surfaces of the forearms, dorsa of the hands), can be associated with the use of fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, after sun or UV light exposure. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 )]. 5.13 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing moxifloxacin hydrochloride in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",

The data described below reflect exposure to moxifloxacin hydrochloride in 14981 patients in 71 active controlled Phase II to IV clinical trials in different indications [see . The population studied had a mean age of 50 years (approximately 73% of the population was less than 65 years of age), 50% were male, 63% were Caucasian, 12% were Asian and 9% were Black. Patients received moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily oral, intravenous, or sequentially (intravenous followed by oral). Treatment duration was usually 6 to 10 days, and the mean number of days on therapy was 9 days. Indications and Usage (1) ] Discontinuation of moxifloxacin due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients overall, 4% of patients treated with 400 mg PO 4% with 400 mg intravenous and 8% with sequential therapy 400 mg  oral/intravenous. The most common adverse reactions (>0.3%) leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg oral doses were nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous dose was rash. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation with the 400 mg intravenous/oral sequential dose were diarrhea, pyrexia. Adverse reactions occurring in 1% of moxifloxacin hydrochloride-treated patients and less common adverse reactions, occurring in 0.1 to 1% of moxifloxacin hydrochloride-treated patients, are shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The most common adverse drug reactions (3%) are nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.

It cannot be determined if any of the above laboratory abnormalities were caused by the drug or the underlying condition being treated. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Table 4 below lists adverse reactions that have been identified during post-approval use of moxifloxacin hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
