  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection, in recipients of allogeneic kidney [see heart Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] , [see or liver transplants Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] [see , in combination with other immunosuppressants. Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ] Mycophenolate mofetil is an antimetabolite immunosuppressant indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in recipients of allogeneic kidney, heart or liver transplants, and should be used in combination with other immunosuppressants. ( 1 )",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Allergic reactions to mycophenolate mofetil have been observed; therefore, mycophenolate mofetil is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) or any component of the drug product. Hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any component of the drug product ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Blood Dyscrasias ( Neutropenia, Red Blood Cell Aplasia ) : Monitor with blood tests; consider treatment interruption or dose reduction. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Complications: Monitor for complications such as bleeding, ulceration and perforations, particularly in patients with underlying gastrointestinal disorders. ( 5.5 ) Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyl-Transferase Deficiency: Avoid use of mycophenolate mofetil. ( 5.6 ) Acute Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with Mycophenolate Products: Monitor for this paradoxical inflammatory reaction. ( 5.7 ) Immunizations: Avoid live attenuated vaccines. ( 5.8 ) Blood Donation: Avoid during therapy and for 6 weeks thereafter. ( 5.11 ) Semen Donation: Avoid during therapy and for 90 days thereafter. ( 5.12 ) Potential Impairment on Driving and Use of Machinery: Mycophenolate mofetil may affect ability to drive or operate machinery. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an increased risk of congenital malformations, especially external ear and other facial abnormalities including cleft lip and palate, and anomalies of the distal limbs, heart, esophagus, kidney and nervous system. Females of reproductive potential must be made aware of these risks and must be counseled regarding pregnancy prevention and planning. Avoid use of MMF during pregnancy if safer treatment options are available [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ] 5.2 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin [see . The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. For patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil ( 2 g or 3 g ) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients [see The majority of PTLD cases appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) infection. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative, a population which includes many young children.In pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides PTLD were observed in clinical trials Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.3 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing bacterial, fungal, protozoal and new or reactivated viral infections, including opportunistic infections. The risk increases with the total immunosuppressive load. These infections may lead to serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and death [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 ) ] Serious viral infections reported include: Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy ( PVAN ) , especially due to BK virus infection JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , and Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease. Viral reactivation in patients infected with Hepatitis B and C COVID-19 Consider dose reduction or discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil in patients who develop new infections or reactivate viral infections, weighing the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft. PVAN, especially due to BK virus infection, is associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [see . Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN. Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] PML, which is sometimes fatal, commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies, and ataxia [see . In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms. Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] The risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor. Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease. Viral reactivation has been reported in patients infected with HBV or HCV. Monitoring infected patients for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV or HCV infection is recommended. 5.4 Blood Dyscrasias: Neutropenia and Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Severe neutropenia [absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) < 0.5 x 10 3 /µL] developed in transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily [see . Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil should be monitored for neutropenia Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Neutropenia has been observed most frequently in the period from 31 to 180 days post-transplant in patients treated for prevention of kidney, heart and liver rejection. The development of neutropenia may be related to mycophenolate mofetil itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or a combination of these causes. If neutropenia develops ( ANC < 1.3 x 10 3 /µL ) , dosing with mycophenolate mofetil should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] Patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow depression. Consider monitoring with complete blood counts weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months, and monthly for the remainder of the first year. Cases of pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, PRCA was found to be reversible with dose reduction or cessation of mycophenolate mofetil therapy. In transplant patients, however, reduced immunosuppression may place the graft at risk. 5.5 Gastrointestinal Complications Gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization, ulceration and perforations were observed in clinical trials. Physicians should be aware of these serious adverse effects particularly when administering mycophenolate mofetil to patients with a gastrointestinal disease. 5.6 Patients with Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyl-Transferase Deficiency ( HGPRT ) Mycophenolate mofetil is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) inhibitor; therefore it should be avoided in patients with hereditary deficiencies of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase ( HGPRT ) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndromes because it may cause an exacerbation of disease symptoms characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of uric acid leading to symptoms associated with gout such as acute arthritis, tophi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis and renal disease including renal failure. 5.7 Acute Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with Mycophenolate Products Acute inflammatory syndrome ( AIS ) has been reported with the use of MMF and mycophenolate products, and some cases have resulted in hospitalization. AIS is a paradoxical pro-inflammatory reaction characterized by fever, arthralgias, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated inflammatory markers including, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, without evidence of infection or underlying disease recurrence. Symptoms occur within weeks to months of initiation of treatment or a dose increase. After discontinuation, improvement of symptoms and inflammatory markers are usually observed within 24 to 48 hours. Monitor patients for symptoms and laboratory parameters of AIS when starting treatment with mycophenolate products or when increasing the dosage. Discontinue treatment and consider other treatment alternatives based on the risk and benefit for the patient. 5.8 Immunizations During treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided ( e.g. , intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21 a typhoid vaccines ) and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Advise patients to discuss with the physician before seeking any immunizations. 5.11 Blood Donation Patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil because their blood or blood products might be administered to a female of reproductive potential or a pregnant woman. 5.12 Semen Donation Based on animal data, men should not donate semen during therapy and for 90 days following discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 ) ] 5.13 Effect of Concomitant Medications on Mycophenolic Acid Concentrations A variety of drugs have potential to alter systemic MPA exposure when co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, determination of MPA concentrations in plasma before and after making any changes to immunosuppressive therapy, or when adding or discontinuing concomitant medications, may be appropriate to ensure MPA concentrations remain stable. 5.14 Potential Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery Mycophenolate mofetil may impact the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should avoid driving or using machines if they experience somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor, or hypotension during treatment with mycophenolate mofetil [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Embryofetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Lymphomas and Other Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions 5.2 ) ] Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Blood Dyscrasias: Neutropenia, Pure Red Cell Aplasia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Gastrointestinal Complications [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Acute Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with Mycophenolate Products [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials ( 20% or greater ) include diarrhea, leukopenia, infection, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections e.g. , opportunistic infection. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 ( 1-877-4-INFO-RX ) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. An estimated total of 1557 patients received mycophenolate mofetil during pivotal clinical trials in the prevention of acute organ rejection. Of these, 991 were included in the three renal studies, 277 were included in one hepatic study, and 289 were included in one cardiac study. Patients in all study arms also received cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The data described below primarily derive from five randomized, active-controlled double-blind 12-month trials of mycophenolate mofetil in de novo kidney ( 3 ) heart ( 1 ) and liver ( 1 ) transplant patients [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 , 14.3 ) ] Mycophenolate Mofetil Oral The incidence of adverse reactions for mycophenolate mofetil was determined in five randomized, comparative, double-blind trials in the prevention of rejection in kidney, heart and liver transplant patients ( two active- and one placebo-controlled trials, one active-controlled trial, and one active-controlled trial, respectively ) [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 and 14.3 ) ] The three de novo kidney studies with 12-month duration compared two dose levels of oral mycophenolate mofetil ( 1 g twice daily and 1.5 g twice daily ) with azathioprine ( 2 studies ) or placebo ( 1 study ) when administered in combination with cyclosporine ( Sandimmune ® ) and corticosteroids to prevent acute rejection episodes. One study also included anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATGAM ® ) induction therapy. In the de novo heart transplantation study with 12-month duration, patients received mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g twice daily ( n = 289 ) or azathioprine 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/day ( n = 289 ) , in combination with cyclosporine ( Sandimmune ® or Neoral ® ) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. In the de novo liver transplantation study with 12-month duration, patients received mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily intravenously for up to 14 days followed by mycophenolate mofetil 1.5 g twice daily orally or azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day intravenously followed by azathioprine 1 to 2 mg/kg/day orally, in combination with cyclosporine ( Neoral ® ) and corticosteroids as maintenance immunosuppressive therapy. The total number of patients enrolled was 565. Approximately 53% of the kidney transplant patients, 65% of the heart transplant patients, and 48% of the liver transplant patients were treated for more than 1 year. Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 20% of patients in the mycophenolate mofetil treatment groups are presented below. The safety data of three kidney transplantation studies are pooled together.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD, pseudolymphoma ) developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil ( 2 g or 3 g daily ) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of kidney, heart and liver transplant patients followed for at least 1 year [see . Non-melanoma skin carcinomas occurred in 1.6% to 4.2% of patients, other types of malignancy in 0.7% to 2.1% of patients. Three-year safety data in kidney and heart transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. In pediatric patients, PTLD was observed in 1.35% ( 2/148 ) by 12 months post-transplant. Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Cytopenias, including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia are a known risk associated with mycophenolate and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and hemorrhages [see . Severe neutropenia ( ANC < 0.5 x 10 Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] 3 /μL ) developed in up to 2% of kidney transplant patients, up to 2.8% of heart transplant patients and up to 3.6% of liver transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil 3 g daily [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil with other immunosuppressants were mucocutaneous candida, CMV viremia/syndrome, and herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viremia/syndrome was 13.5% . In patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil ( 2 g or 3 g ) in controlled studies for prevention of kidney, heart or liver rejection, fatal infection/sepsis occurred in approximately 2% of kidney and heart patients and in 5% of liver patients [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] The most serious gastrointestinal disorders reported were ulceration and hemorrhage, which are known risks associated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers often complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis and colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials, while the most common gastrointestinal disorders were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of patients with mycophenolate mofetil-related diarrhea revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] The following adverse reactions were reported with 3% to < 20% incidence in kidney, heart, and liver transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Table 3. Adverse Reactions in Controlled Studies of De Novo Kidney, Heart or Liver Transplantation Reported in 3% to < 20% of Patients Treated with Mycophenolate Mofetil in Combination with Cyclosporine and Corticosteroids System Organ Class Adverse Reactions Body as a Whole cellulitis, chills, hernia, malaise Infections and Infestations fungal infections Hematologic and Lymphatic coagulation disorder, ecchymosis, pancytopenia Urogenital hematuria Cardiovascular hypotension Metabolic and Nutritional acidosis, alkaline phosphatase increased, hyperlipemia, hypophosphatemia, weight loss Digestive esophagitis, flatulence, gastritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis, ileus, nausea and vomiting, stomach ulcer, stomatitis Neoplasm benign, malignant and unspecified neoplasm Skin and Appendages skin benign neoplasm, skin carcinoma Psychiatric confusional state Nervous hypertonia, paresthesia, somnolence Musculoskeletal arthralgia, myasthenia Pediatric Study The type and frequency of adverse events in a clinical study for prevention of kidney allograft rejection in 100 pediatric patients 3 months to 18 years of age dosed with mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension 600 mg/m 2 twice daily ( up to 1 g twice daily ) were generally similar to those observed in adult patients dosed with mycophenolate mofetil capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily with the exception of abdominal pain, fever, infection, pain, sepsis, diarrhea, vomiting, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection, hypertension, leukopenia, and anemia, which were observed in a higher proportion in pediatric patients. Geriatrics Geriatric patients ( ≥ 65 years ) , particularly those who are receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections ( including cytomegalovirus [CMV] tissue invasive disease ) and possibly gastrointestinal hemorrhage and pulmonary edema, compared to younger individuals [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of mycophenolate mofetil. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Congenital malformations and spontaneous abortions, mainly in the first trimester, have been reported following exposure to mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) in combination with other immunosuppressants during pregnancy [see . Congenital malformations include: Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) , ( 8.3 ) ] Facial malformations: cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia, hypertelorism of the orbits Abnormalities of the ear and eye: abnormally formed or absent external/middle ear, coloboma, microphthalmos Malformations of the fingers: polydactyly, syndactyly, brachydactyly Cardiac abnormalities: atrial and ventricular septal defects Esophageal malformations: esophageal atresia Nervous system malformations: such as spina bifida . Cardiovascular : Venous thrombosis has been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil administered intravenously. Digestive : Colitis, pancreatitis. Hematologic and Lymphatic : Bone marrow failure, cases of pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressive agents [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Immune : Hypersensitivity, hypogammaglobinemia. Infections : Meningitis, infectious endocarditis, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, BK virus infection, viral reactivation of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, protozoal infections [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Respiratory : Bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, fatal pulmonary fibrosis, have been reported rarely and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary symptoms ranging from dyspnea to respiratory failure in post-transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil. Vascular : Lymphocele."
