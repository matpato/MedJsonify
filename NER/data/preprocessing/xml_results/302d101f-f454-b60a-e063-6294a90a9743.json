MIFEPREX is a progestin antagonist indicated, in a regimen with misoprostol, for the medical termination of intrauterine pregnancy through 70 days gestation. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Administration of MIFEPREX and misoprostol for the termination of pregnancy (the “treatment procedure”) is contraindicated in patients with any of the following conditions: Confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy or undiagnosed adnexal mass (the treatment procedure will not be effective to terminate an ectopic pregnancy) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Chronic adrenal failure (risk of acute adrenal insufficiency) Concurrent long-term corticosteroid therapy (risk of acute adrenal insufficiency) History of allergy to mifepristone, misoprostol, or other prostaglandins (allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, hives, and itching have been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.2 )] Hemorrhagic disorders or concurrent anticoagulant therapy (risk of heavy bleeding) Inherited porphyrias (risk of worsening or of precipitation of attacks) Use of MIFEPREX and misoprostol for termination of intrauterine pregnancy is contraindicated in patients with an intrauterine device (“IUD”) in place (the IUD might interfere with pregnancy termination).

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ectopic pregnancy: Exclude before treatment. ( 5.4 ) Rhesus immunization: Prevention needed as for surgical abortion. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Infection and Sepsis As with other types of abortion, cases of serious bacterial infection, including very rare cases of fatal septic shock, have been reported following the use of MIFEPREX [see . Healthcare providers evaluating a patient who is undergoing a medical abortion should be alert to the possibility of this rare event. A sustained (> 4 hours) fever of 100.4°F or higher, severe abdominal pain, or pelvic tenderness in the days after a medical abortion may be an indication of infection. Boxed Warning ] A high index of suspicion is needed to rule out sepsis (e.g., from Clostridium sordellii ) if a patient reports abdominal pain or discomfort or general malaise (including weakness, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) more than 24 hours after taking misoprostol. Very rarely, deaths have been reported in patients who presented without fever, with or without abdominal pain, but with leukocytosis with a marked left shift, tachycardia, hemoconcentration, and general malaise. No causal relationship between MIFEPREX and misoprostol use and an increased risk of infection or death has been established. Clostridium sordellii infections have also been reported very rarely following childbirth (vaginal delivery and caesarian section), and in other gynecologic and non-gynecologic conditions. 5.2 Uterine Bleeding Uterine bleeding occurs in almost all patients during a medical abortion. Prolonged heavy bleeding (soaking through two thick full-size sanitary pads per hour for two consecutive hours) may be a sign of incomplete abortion or other complications, and prompt medical or surgical intervention may be needed to prevent the development of hypovolemic shock. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience prolonged heavy vaginal bleeding following a medical abortion [see . Boxed Warning ] Women should expect to experience vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9 to 16 days. Women report experiencing heavy bleeding for a median duration of 2 days. Up to 8% of all subjects may experience some type of bleeding for 30 days or more. In general, the duration of bleeding and spotting increased as the duration of the pregnancy increased. Decreases in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and red blood cell count may occur in patients who bleed heavily. Excessive uterine bleeding usually requires treatment by uterotonics, vasoconstrictor drugs, surgical uterine evacuation, administration of saline infusions, and/or blood transfusions. Based on data from several large clinical trials, vasoconstrictor drugs were used in 4.3% of all subjects, there was a decrease in hemoglobin of more than 2 g/dL in 5.5% of subjects, and blood transfusions were administered to ≤ 0.1% of subjects. Because heavy bleeding requiring surgical uterine evacuation occurs in about 1% of patients, special care should be given to patients with hemostatic disorders, hypocoagulability, or severe anemia. 5.3 Mifepristone REMS Program MIFEPREX is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called the Mifepristone REMS Program, because of the risks of serious complications [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 , 5.2 )] Notable requirements of the Mifepristone REMS Program include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the program by completing the Prescriber Agreement Form. Patients must sign a Patient Agreement Form. MIFEPREX must only be dispensed to patients by or under the supervision of a certified prescriber, or by certified pharmacies on prescriptions issued by certified prescribers. Further information is available at 1-877-4 Early Option (1-877-432-7596). 5.4 Ectopic Pregnancy MIFEPREX is contraindicated in patients with a confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy because MIFEPREX is not effective for terminating ectopic pregnancies [see Contraindications ( Healthcare providers should remain alert to the possibility that a patient who is undergoing a medical abortion could have an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy because some of the expected symptoms experienced with a medical abortion (abdominal pain, uterine bleeding) may be similar to those of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The presence of an ectopic pregnancy may have been missed even if the patient underwent ultrasonography prior to being prescribed MIFEPREX. 4 )]. Patients who became pregnant with an IUD in place should be assessed for ectopic pregnancy. 5.5 Rhesus Immunization The use of MIFEPREX is assumed to require the same preventive measures as those taken prior to and during surgical abortion to prevent rhesus immunization.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections: Infection and sepsis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Uterine bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Most common adverse reactions (>15%) are nausea, weakness, fever/chills, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Danco Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-432-7596 or medicaldirector@earlyoptionpill.com or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Information presented on common adverse reactions relies solely on data from U.S. studies, because rates reported in non-U.S. studies were markedly lower and are not likely generalizable to the U.S. population. In three U.S. clinical studies totaling 1,248 women through 70 days gestation who used mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 24-48 hours later by misoprostol 800 mcg buccally, women reported adverse reactions in diaries and in interviews at the follow-up visit. These studies enrolled generally healthy women of reproductive age without contraindications to mifepristone or misoprostol use according to the MIFEPREX product label. Gestational age was assessed prior to study enrollment using the date of the woman's last menstrual period, clinical evaluation, and/or ultrasound examination. About 85% of patients report at least one adverse reaction following administration of MIFEPREX and misoprostol, and many can be expected to report more than one such reaction. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>15%) were nausea, weakness, fever/chills, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, and dizziness (see Table 1 ). The frequency of adverse reactions varies between studies and may be dependent on many factors, including the patient population and gestational age. Abdominal pain/cramping is expected in all medical abortion patients and its incidence is not reported in clinical studies. Treatment with MIFEPREX and misoprostol is designed to induce uterine bleeding and cramping to cause termination of an intrauterine pregnancy. Uterine bleeding and cramping are expected consequences of the action of MIFEPREX and misoprostol as used in the treatment procedure. Most patients can expect bleeding more heavily than they do during a heavy menstrual period [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in U.S. clinical studies with incidence >15% of women.

Information on serious adverse reactions was reported in six U.S. and four non-U.S. clinical studies, totaling 30,966 women through 70 days gestation who used mifepristone 200 mg orally followed 24-48 hours later by misoprostol 800 mcg buccally. Serious adverse reaction rates were similar between U.S. and non-U.S. studies, so rates from both U.S. and non-U.S. studies are presented. In the U.S. studies, one studied women through 56 days gestation, four through 63 days gestation, and one through 70 days gestation, while in the non-U.S. studies, two studied women through 63 days gestation, and two through 70 days gestation. Serious adverse reactions were reported in <0.5% of women. Information from the U.S. and non-U.S. studies is presented in Table 2 .
