    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Monitoring: Continuously monitor patients while receiving dexmedetomidine injection. ( 5.1 ) • Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest: Have occurred in young healthy volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration, e.g., rapid intravenous or bolus administration. ( 5.2 ) • Hypotension and Bradycardia: May necessitate medical intervention. May be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension, and in the elderly. Use with caution in patients with advanced heart block or severe ventricular dysfunction. ( 5.2 ) • Co-administration with Other Vasodilators or Negative Chronotropic Agents: Use with caution due to additive pharmacodynamic effects. ( 5.2 ) • Transient Hypertension: Observed primarily during the loading dose. Consider reduction in loading infusion rate. ( 5.3 ) • Arousability: Patients can become aroused/alert with stimulation; this alone should not be considered as lack of efficacy. ( 5.4 ) • Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis: Prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse events. ( 5.6 ) 5.1\tDrug Administration Dexmedetomidine injection should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of dexmedetomidine injection, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving dexmedetomidine injection. 5.2\tHypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with dexmedetomidine injection administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration. Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with dexmedetomidine injection infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of dexmedetomidine injection, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because dexmedetomidine injection has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents (e.g., glycopyrrolate, atropine) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of dexmedetomidine injection-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required. Caution should be exercised when administering dexmedetomidine injection to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because dexmedetomidine injection decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients. In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with dexmedetomidine injection an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with dexmedetomidine injection. 5.3\tTransient Hypertension Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of dexmedetomidine injection. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable. 5.4\tArousability Some patients receiving dexmedetomidine injection have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms. 5.5\tWithdrawal Intensive Care Unit Sedation With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 (5%) dexmedetomidine injection adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 (3%) dexmedetomidine injection adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of < 5%. Procedural Sedation In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short-term infusions of dexmedetomidine injection (< 6 hours). In pediatric patients, mild transient withdrawal symptoms of emergence delirium or agitation were seen after discontinuation of short-term infusions of dexmedetomidine injection (< 2 hours). Pediatric use information is approved for Hospira Inc.’s PRECEDEX™ (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) injection and PRECEDEX™ (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) in sodium chloride injection. However, due to Hospira Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 5.6\tTolerance and Tachyphylaxis Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.7 \tHyperthermia or Pyrexia Dexmedetomidine injection may induce hyperthermia or pyrexia, which may be resistant to traditional cooling methods, such as administration of cooled intravenous fluids and antipyretic medications. Discontinue dexmedetomidine injection if drug-related hyperthermia or pyrexia is suspected and monitor patients until body temperature normalizes. 5.8\tHepatic Impairment Since dexmedetomidine clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ]",

Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of adult patients in both Intensive Care Unit and procedural sedation studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth. Intensive Care Unit Sedation Adverse reaction information is derived from the continuous infusion trials of dexmedetomidine injection for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit setting in which 1,007 adult patients received dexmedetomidine injection. The mean total dose was 7.4 mcg/kg (range: 0.8 to 84.1), mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.1 to 6.0) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours (range: 0.2 to 157.2). The population was between 17 to 88 years of age, 43% ≥ 65 years of age, 77% male and 93% Caucasian. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of > 2% are provided in Table 3.

The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 to 6.7), mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.3 to 6.1) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 to 6.2). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I-IV, 30% ≥ 65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian. Clinical Studies (14.2) ] Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring in adults at an incidence of > 2% are provided in Table 7. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth [see . Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table. The decrease in respiratory rate and hypoxia was similar between dexmedetomidine injection and comparator groups in both studies. Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Table 7: Adverse Reactions with an Incidence > 2%–Adult Procedural Sedation Population Adverse Event Dexmedetomidine Injection (N = 318) (%) Placebo (N = 113) (%) Hypotension Hypotension was defined in absolute and relative terms as Systolic blood pressure of < 80 mmHg or ≤ 30% lower than pre-study drug infusion value, or Diastolic blood pressure of < 50 mmHg. 54% 30% Respiratory Depression Respiratory depression was defined in absolute and relative terms as respiratory rate (RR) < 8 beats per minute or > 25% decrease from baseline. 37% 32% Bradycardia Bradycardia was defined in absolute and relative terms as < 40 beats per minute or ≤ 30% lower than pre-study drug infusion value. Subjects in Study 2 were pretreated with glycopyrrolate 0.1 mg intravenously before receiving study drug [see . Clinical Studies (14.2) ] 14% 4% Hypertension Hypertension was defined in absolute and relative terms as Systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or ≥ 30% higher than pre-study drug infusion value or Diastolic blood pressure of > 100 mmHg. 13% 24% Tachycardia Tachycardia was defined in absolute and relative terms as > 120 beats per minute or ≥ 30% greater than pre-study drug infusion value. 5% 17% Nausea 3% 2% Dry Mouth 3% 1% Hypoxia Hypoxia was defined in absolute and relative terms as SpO 2 < 90% or 10% decrease from baseline. 2% 3% Bradypnea 2% 4% Pediatric use information is approved for Hospira Inc.’s PRECEDEX™ (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) injection and PRECEDEX™ (dexmedetomidine hydrochloride) in sodium chloride injection. However, due to Hospira Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of dexmedetomidine injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypotension and bradycardia were the most common adverse reactions associated with the use of dexmedetomidine injection during post-approval use of the drug.
