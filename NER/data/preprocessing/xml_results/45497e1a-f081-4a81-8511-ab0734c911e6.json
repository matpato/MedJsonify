    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-Related Reactions (IRR)/Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic Reactions : Administer BIZENGRI in a setting with emergency resuscitation equipment and staff who are trained to monitor for IRRs and to administer emergency medications. Monitor for signs and symptoms of IRR. Interrupt infusion in patients with ≤ Grade 3 IRRs and administer symptomatic treatment as needed. Resume infusion at a reduced rate after resolution of symptoms. Immediately stop the infusion and permanently discontinue BIZENGRI for Grade 4 or life-threatening IRR or hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis. ( 5.1 ) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis : Monitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue BIZENGRI in patients with ≥ Grade 2 ILD/pneumonitis. ( 5.2 ) Left Ventricular Dysfunction : Assess LVEF before initiating BIZENGRI and at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. Manage through treatment interruption or discontinuation. Permanently discontinue BIZENGRI in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF). ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Infusion-Related Reactions/Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic Reactions BIZENGRI can cause serious and life-threatening infusion-related reactions (IRRs), hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions. Signs and symptoms of IRR may include chills, nausea, fever, and cough. In the eNRGy study, 13% of patients experienced IRRs, all were Grade 1 or 2; 91% occurred during the first infusion.  The median time to onset was 63 minutes (range: 13 minutes to 240 minutes) from the start of infusion. Administer BIZENGRI in a setting with emergency resuscitation equipment and staff who are trained to monitor for IRRs and to administer emergency medications. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions during infusion and for at least 1 hour following completion of first BIZENGRI infusion and as clinically indicated. Prior to the first BIZENGRI infusion, premedicate with a corticosteroid, an H1 antihistamine and acetaminophen to reduce the risk of IRRs [see Dosage and Administration ( Corticosteroid premedication can be used as necessary for subsequent BIZENGRI infusions. 2.4 )]. Interrupt BIZENGRI infusion in patients with ≤ Grade 3 IRRs and administer symptomatic treatment as needed. Resume infusion at a reduced rate after resolution of symptoms [see Dosage and Administration ( Immediately stop the infusion and permanently discontinue BIZENGRI for Grade 4 or life-threatening IRR or hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions. 2.5 )]. 5.2 Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis BIZENGRI can cause serious and life-threatening interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. In the eNRGy study [see Adverse Reactions ( ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 2 (1.1%) patients treated with BIZENGRI. Grade 2 ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 2) resulting in permanent discontinuation of BIZENGRI occurred in 1 (0.6%) patient. 6.1 )], Monitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold BIZENGRI in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and administer corticosteroids as clinically indicated. Permanently discontinue BIZENGRI if ILD/pneumonitis ≥ Grade 2 is confirmed [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 5.3 Left Ventricular Dysfunction BIZENGRI can cause left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decrease occurred with anti-HER2 therapies, including BIZENGRI. Treatment with BIZENGRI has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF less than 50% prior to initiation of treatment. In the eNRGy study [see Adverse Reactions ( Grade 2 LVEF decrease [Grade 2 LVEF decrease (40%-50%; 10 - 19% drop from baseline)] occurred in 2% of evaluable patients. Cardiac failure without LVEF decrease occurred in 1.7% of patients including 1 (0.6%) fatal event. 6.1 )], Before initiating BIZENGRI, evaluate LVEF and monitor at regular intervals during treatment as clinically indicated. For LVEF of less than 45% or less than 50% with absolute decrease from baseline of 10% or greater is confirmed, permanently discontinue BIZENGRI. Permanently discontinue BIZENGRI in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, BIZENGRI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In literature reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios manifesting as fatal pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of HER2 and/or HER3 results in impaired embryo-fetal development, including effects on cardiac, vascular and neuronal development, and embryolethality. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of BIZENGRI. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BIZENGRI and for 2 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.3 )]",

There were 2 fatal adverse reactions, one due to COVID-19 and one due to respiratory failure. Dosage interruptions of BIZENGRI due to an adverse reaction, excluding temporary interruptions of BIZENGRI due to infusion-related reactions, occurred in 33% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to dosage interruptions in ≥2% of patients included COVID-19, pneumonia, increased AST, neutropenia, abdominal pain, agitation, increased blood alkaline phosphatase, increased blood bilirubin, constipation, increased creatinine, hemorrhage, hyperbilirubinemia, cholestatic jaundice, tachycardia, traumatic fracture, and upper respiratory infection. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions in the eNRGy study in patients with NRG1 gene fusion positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Table 5: Adverse Reactions (≥10%) in Patients with NRG1 Gene Fusion Positive Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Who Received BIZENGRI in the eNRGy Study 1 Based on NCI CTCAE v4.03 and MedDRA v26.0 2 Includes back pain, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal chest pain, myalgia, arthralgia, non-cardiac chest pain, bone pain, musculoskeletal stiffness, neck pain, spinal pain 3 Includes asthenia 4 Includes peripheral edema, face edema, localized edema, peripheral swelling 5 Includes chills, IRR, nausea, cough, diarrhea, back pain, body temperature increased, dyspnea, face edema, fatigue, non-cardiac chest pain, oropharyngeal discomfort, paresthesia, pyrexia, and vomiting 6 Includes epistaxis, hematochezia, hematuria, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage Adverse Reaction 1 BIZENGRI (N=39) All Grades (%) Grade 3 or 4 (%) Gastrointestinal disorders Diarrhea 36 5 Nausea 23 5 Vomiting 23 2.6 Abdominal pain 18 5 Constipation 15 0 Abdominal distension 13 0 Stomatitis 10 0 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Musculoskeletal pain 2 28 2.6 General disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue 3 21 5 Edema 4 13 0 Pyrexia 10 0 Infections and infestations COVID-19 18 0 Injury, poisoning and procedural complications Infusion-related reactions 5 15 0 Vascular disorders Hemorrhage 6 13 5 Psychiatric disorders Anxiety 10 0 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Dry skin 10 0 Clinically relevant adverse reactions in <10% of patients receiving BIZENGRI were decreased appetite (5%), and rash (8%) [including dermatitis acneiform, erythema, dermatitis, dermatitis contact, rash maculopapular, rash erythematous]. Table 6 summarizes the laboratory abnormalities in the eNRGy study in patients with NRG1 gene fusion positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Table 6: Select Laboratory Abnormalities ≥ 20% That Worsened from Baseline in Patients with NRG1 Gene Fusion Positive Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Who Received BIZENGRI in the eNRGy Study 1 The denominator used to calculate the rate varied from 35 to 39, based on the number of patients with a baseline value and at least one post-treatment value. Laboratory Abnormality BIZENGRI 1 (N=39) All Grades (%) Grade 3 or 4 (%) Chemistry Increased alanine aminotransferase 51 5 Increased aspartate aminotransferase 31 5 Increased bilirubin 31 5 Decreased phosphate 31 2.9 Increased alkaline phosphatase 28 8 Decreased sodium 28 10 Decreased albumin 26 0 Decreased potassium 26 2.6 Decreased magnesium 24 2.6 Increased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 23 15 Hematology Decreased platelets 26 10 Decreased hemoglobin 23 10 Decreased leukocytes 21 2.6"
