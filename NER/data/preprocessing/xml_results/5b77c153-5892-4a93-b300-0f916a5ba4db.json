    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Voriconazole is an azole antifungal indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients aged 2 years of age and older with: Invasive      aspergillosis ( 1.1 ) Candidemia in non-neutropenics and other deep      tissue Candida infections ( 1.2 ) Esophageal      candidiasis ( 1.3 ) Serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium      apiospermum and Fusarium species including Fusarium solani ,      in patients intolerant of, or refractory to, other therapy ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Invasive Aspergillosis Voriconazole tablets are indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA). In clinical trials, the majority of isolates recovered were Aspergillus fumigatus . There was a small number of cases of culture-proven disease due to species of Aspergillus other than A. fumigatus [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.5 ) and Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 1.2 Candidemia in Non-neutropenic Patients and Other Deep Tissue Candida Infections Voriconazole tablets are indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) for the treatment of candidemia in non-neutropenic patients and the following Candida infections: disseminated infections in skin and infections in abdomen, kidney, bladder wall, and wounds [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 , 14.5 ) and Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 1.3 Esophageal Candidiasis Voriconazole tablets are indicated in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis (EC) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 , 14.5 ) and Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 1.4 Scedosporiosis and Fusariosis Voriconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium apiospermum (asexual form of Pseudallescheria boydii ) and Fusarium spp. including Fusarium solani , in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older intolerant of, or refractory to, other therapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 ) and Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. 1.5 Usage Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (including histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organism(s). Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known. However, once these results become available, antifungal therapy should be adjusted accordingly.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Voriconazole tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients. There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between voriconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing voriconazole to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles. Coadministration of pimozide , quinidine or ivabradine with voriconazole is contraindicated because increased plasma concentrations of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes [ see Drug Interactions( ]. 7 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with sirolimus is contraindicated because voriconazole significantly increases sirolimus concentrations [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with rifampin, carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates, or St John's Wort is contraindicated because these drugs are likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) Coadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg every 24 hours or higher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations. Coadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg every 12 hours) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with rifabutin is contraindicated since voriconazole significantly increases rifabutin plasma concentrations and rifabutin also significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) is contraindicated because voriconazole may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids, which may lead to ergotism [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with naloxegol is contraindicated because voriconazole may increase plasma concentrations of naloxegol which may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] Coadministration of voricoazole with tolvaptan is contraindicated because voriconazole may increase tolvaptan plasma concentrations and increase risk of adverse reactions [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with venetoclax at initiation and during the ramp-up phase is contraindicated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) due to the potential for increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome [ see Drug Interactions( ]. 7 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in significant increases in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions [ see Drug Interactions( ]. 7 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with finerenone is contraindicated since it may result in significant increases in finerenone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients ( 4 ) Coadministration with pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus or ivabradine due to risk of serious adverse reactions ( 4 , 7 ) Coadministration with rifampin, carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates, efavirenz, ritonavir, rifabutin, ergot alkaloids or St. John's Wort due to risk of loss of efficacy ( 4 , 7 ) Coadministration with naloxegol, tolvaptan, lurasidone or finerenone due to risk of adverse reactions ( 4 , 7 ) Coadministration of voriconazole with venetoclax at initiation and during the ramp-up phase in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) due to increased risk of adverse reactions ( 4 , 7 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatic Toxicity : Serious hepatic reactions reported. Evaluate liver function tests at start of and during voriconazole therapy ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation : Correct potassium, magnesium and calcium prior to use; caution patients with proarrhythmic conditions ( 5.2 ) Visual Disturbances (including optic neuritis and papilledema): Monitor visual function if treatment continues beyond 28 days ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue for exfoliative cutaneous reactions ( 5.5 ) Photosensitivity : Avoid sunlight due to risk of photosensitivity ( 5.6 ) Adrenal Dysfunction: Carefully monitor patients receiving voriconazole and corticosteroids (via all routes of administration) for adrenal dysfunction both during and after voriconazole treatment. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome or adrenal insufficiency ( 5.8 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Inform pregnant patients of the potential hazard to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with voriconazole ( 5.9 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) Skeletal Adverse Reactions : Fluorosis and periostitis with long-term voriconazole therapy. Discontinue if these adverse reactions occur ( 5.12 ) Clinically Significant Drug Interactions : Review patient's concomitant medications ( 5.13 , 7 ) Patients with Hereditary Galactose Intolerance, Lapp Lactase Deficiency or Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption: Voriconazole tablets should not be given to these patients because it contains lactose ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Hepatic Toxicity In clinical trials, there have been uncommon cases of serious hepatic reactions during treatment with voriconazole (including clinical hepatitis, cholestasis and fulminant hepatic failure, including fatalities). Instances of hepatic reactions were noted to occur primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (predominantly hematological malignancy). Hepatic reactions, including hepatitis and jaundice, have occurred among patients with no other identifiable risk factors. Liver dysfunction has usually been reversible on discontinuation of therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] A higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations was observed in the pediatric population [see Adverse Reactions ( Hepatic function should be monitored in both adult and pediatric patients. 6.1 )]. Measure serum transaminase levels and bilirubin at the initiation of voriconazole therapy and monitor at least weekly for the first month of treatment. Monitoring frequency can be reduced to monthly during continued use if no clinically significant changes are noted. If liver function tests become markedly elevated compared to baseline, voriconazole should be discontinued unless the medical judgment of the benefit/risk of the treatment for the patient justifies continued use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.2 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including voriconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. During clinical development and postmarketing surveillance, there have been rare cases of arrhythmias, (including ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes ), cardiac arrests and sudden deaths in patients taking voriconazole. These cases usually involved seriously ill patients with multiple confounding risk factors, such as history of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, cardiomyopathy, hypokalemia and concomitant medications that may have been contributory. Voriconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions, such as: Congenital or      acquired QT prolongation Cardiomyopathy,      in particular when heart failure is present Sinus      bradycardia Existing      symptomatic arrhythmias Concomitant      medicinal product that is known to prolong QT interval [ see      Contraindications ( ] 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ),      and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) Rigorous attempts to correct potassium, magnesium and calcium should be made before starting and during voriconazole therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( ]. 12.3 ) 5.4 Visual Disturbances The effect of voriconazole on visual function is not known if treatment continues beyond 28 days. There have been postmarketing reports of prolonged visual adverse reactions, including optic neuritis and papilledema. If treatment continues beyond 28 days, visual function including visual acuity, visual field, and color perception should be monitored [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6.2 ) 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which can be life-threatening or fatal, have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. If a patient develops a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, voriconazole should be discontinued [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6.1 , 6.2 ) 5.6 Photosensitivity Voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity skin reaction. Patients, including pediatric patients, should avoid exposure to direct sunlight during voriconazole treatment and should use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). If phototoxic reactions occur, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist and voriconazole discontinuation should be considered. If voriconazole is continued despite the occurrence of phototoxicity-related lesions, dermatologic evaluation should be performed on a systematic and regular basis to allow early detection and management of premalignant lesions. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (including cutaneous SCC in situ , or Bowen's disease) and melanoma have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy in patients with photosensitivity skin reactions. If a patient develops a skin lesion consistent with premalignant skin lesions, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma, voriconazole should be discontinued. In addition, voriconazole has been associated with photosensitivity related skin reactions such as pseudoporphyria, cheilitis, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus, as well as increased risk of skin toxicity with concomitant use of methotrexate, a drug associated with ultraviolet (UV) reactivation. There is the potential for this risk to be observed with other drugs associated with UV reactivation. Patients should avoid strong, direct sunlight during voriconazole therapy. The frequency of phototoxicity reactions is higher in the pediatric population. Because squamous cell carcinoma has been reported in patients who experience photosensitivity reactions, stringent measures for photoprotection are warranted in children. In children experiencing photoaging injuries such as lentigines or ephelides, sun avoidance and dermatologic follow-up are recommended even after treatment discontinuation. 5.7 Renal Toxicity Acute renal failure has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and may have concurrent conditions that may result in decreased renal function. Patients should be monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation of serum creatinine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )] 5.8 Adrenal Dysfunction Reversible cases of azole-induced adrenal insufficiency have been reported in patients receiving azoles, including voriconazole. Adrenal insufficiency has been reported in patients receiving azoles with or without concomitant corticosteroids. In patients receiving azoles without corticosteroids adrenal insufficiency is related to direct inhibition of steroidogenesis by azoles. In patients taking corticosteroids, voriconazole associated CYP3A4 inhibition of their metabolism may lead to corticosteroid excess and adrenal suppression [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( ]. Cushing's syndrome with and without subsequent adrenal insufficiency has also been reported in patients receiving voriconazole concomitantly with corticosteroids. 12.3 ) Patients receiving voriconazole and corticosteroids (via all routes of administration) should be carefully monitored for adrenal dysfunction both during and after voriconazole treatment. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical care if they develop signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome or adrenal insufficiency. 5.9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Voriconazole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animals, voriconazole administration was associated with fetal malformations, embryotoxicity, increased gestational length, dystocia and embryomortality [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] If voriconazole is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking voriconazole, inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with voriconazole [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.3 )] 5.10 Laboratory Tests Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia should be corrected prior to initiation of and during voriconazole therapy. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of renal (particularly serum creatinine) and hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). 5.11 Pancreatitis Pancreatitis has been observed in patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole [see Adverse Reactions ( Patients with risk factors for acute pancreatitis (e.g., recent chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) should be monitored for the development of pancreatitis during voriconazole treatment. 6.1 , 6.2 )] 5.12 Skeletal Adverse Reactions Fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy. If a patient develops skeletal pain and radiologic findings compatible with fluorosis or periostitis, voriconazole should be discontinued [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.13 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions See Table 10 for a listing of drugs that may significantly alter voriconazole concentrations. Also, see Table 11 for a listing of drugs that may interact with voriconazole resulting in altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the other drug [see Contraindications ( . 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] 5.14 Galactose Intolerance Voriconazole tablets contain lactose and should not be given to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.",

Clinical Trials Experience in Adults Overview The most frequently reported adverse reactions (see Table 4 ) in the adult therapeutic trials were visual disturbances (18.7%), fever (5.7%), nausea (5.4%), rash (5.3%), vomiting (4.4%), chills (3.7%), headache (3.0%), liver function test increased (2.7%), tachycardia (2.4%), hallucinations (2.4%). The adverse reactions which most often led to discontinuation of voriconazole therapy were elevated liver function tests, rash, and visual disturbances [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. The data described in Table 4 reflect exposure to voriconazole in 1655 patients in nine therapeutic studies. This represents a heterogeneous population, including immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients with hematological malignancy or HIV and non-neutropenic patients. This subgroup does not include healthy subjects and patients treated in the compassionate use and non-therapeutic studies. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 46 years (range 11 to 90, including 51 patients aged 12 to 18 years), and was 78% White and 10% Black. Five hundred sixty one patients had a duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 136 patients receiving voriconazole for over six months. Table 4 includes all adverse reactions which were reported at an incidence of ≥2% during voriconazole therapy in the all therapeutic studies population, studies 307/602 and 608 combined, or study 305, as well as events of concern which occurred at an incidence of <2%. In study 307/602, 381 patients (196 on voriconazole, 185 on amphotericin B) were treated to compare voriconazole to amphotericin B followed by other licensed antifungal therapy (OLAT) in the primary treatment of patients with acute IA. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse reactions was 21.4% (42/196 patients). In study 608, 403 patients with candidemia were treated to compare voriconazole (272 patients) to the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole (131 patients). The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication due to adverse reactions was 19.5% out of 272 patients. Study 305 evaluated the effects of oral voriconazole (200 patients) and oral fluconazole (191 patients) in the treatment of EC. The rate of discontinuation from voriconazole study medication in Study 305 due to adverse reactions was 7% (14/200 patients).

In therapeutic trials, approximately 21% of patients experienced abnormal vision, color vision change and/or photophobia. Visual disturbances may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The mechanism of action of the visual disturbance is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina. In a study in healthy subjects investigating the effect of 28-day treatment with voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude, a decrease in the visual field, and an alteration in color perception. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. These effects were noted early in administration of voriconazole and continued through the course of study drug treatment. Fourteen days after the end of dosing, ERG, visual fields and color perception returned to normal [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.4 ) Dermatological Reactions Dermatological reactions were common in patients treated with voriconazole. The mechanism underlying these dermatologic adverse reactions remains unknown. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported during treatment with voriconazole. Erythema multiforme has also been reported during treatment with voriconazole [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.5 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) Voriconazole has also been associated with additional photosensitivity related skin reactions such as pseudoporphyria, cheilitis, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions occurred in <2% of all voriconazole-treated patients in all therapeutic studies (N=1655).

Clinical Laboratory Values in Adults The overall incidence of transaminase increases >3x upper limit of normal (not necessarily comprising an adverse reaction) was 17.7% (268/1514) in adult subjects treated with voriconazole for therapeutic use in pooled clinical trials. Increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or resolved following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy. Voriconazole has been infrequently associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity including cases of jaundice and rare cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death. Most of these patients had other serious underlying conditions. Liver function tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of voriconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during voriconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver function tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of voriconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to voriconazole [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.1 ) Acute renal failure has been observed in severely ill patients undergoing treatment with voriconazole. Patients being treated with voriconazole are likely to be treated concomitantly with nephrotoxic medications and may have concurrent conditions that can result in decreased renal function. It is recommended that patients are monitored for the development of abnormal renal function. This should include laboratory evaluation of serum creatinine. Tables 5 to 7 show the number of patients with hypokalemia and clinically significant changes in renal and liver function tests in three randomized, comparative multicenter studies. In study 305, patients with EC were randomized to either oral voriconazole or oral fluconazole. In study 307/602, patients with definite or probable IA were randomized to either voriconazole or amphotericin B therapy. In study 608, patients with candidemia were randomized to either voriconazole or the regimen of amphotericin B followed by fluconazole.

Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In clinical studies, serious adverse reactions occurred in 46% (48/105) of voriconazole treated pediatric patients. Treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 12/105 (11%) of all patients. Hepatic adverse reactions (i.e. ALT increased; liver function test abnormal; jaundice) 6% (6/105) accounted for the majority of voriconazole treatment discontinuations. Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥5% of pediatric patients receiving voriconazole in the pooled pediatric clinical trials are displayed by body system, in Table 8.

Abbreviations: ALT = alanine aminotransferase; LFT = liver function test The following adverse reactions with incidence less than 5% were reported in 105 pediatric patients treated with voriconazole: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia Cardiac Disorders: bradycardia, palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia Eye Disorders: dry eye, keratitis Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: tinnitus, vertigo Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal tenderness, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: asthenia, catheter site pain, chills, hypothermia, lethargy Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity, urticaria Infections and Infestations: conjunctivitis Laboratory Investigations: AST increased, blood creatinine increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypoglycemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: arthralgia, myalgia Nervous System Disorders: ataxia , convulsion, dizziness, nystagmus, paresthesia, syncope Psychiatric Disorders: affect lability, agitation, anxiety, depression, insomnia Respiratory Disorders: bronchospasm, nasal congestion, respiratory failure, tachypnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: alopecia, dermatitis (allergic, contact, and exfoliative), pruritus Vascular Disorders: flushing, phlebitis Hepatic-Related Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients The frequency of hepatic-related adverse reactions in pediatric patients exposed to voriconazole in therapeutic studies was numerically higher than that of adults (28.6% compared to 24.1%, respectively). The higher frequency of hepatic adverse reactions in the pediatric population was mainly due to an increased frequency of liver enzyme elevations (21.9% in pediatric patients compared to 16.1% in adults), including transaminase elevations (ALT and AST combined) 7.6% in the pediatric patients compared to 5.1% in adults. Clinical Laboratory Values in Pediatric Patients The overall incidence of transaminase increases >3x upper limit of normal was 27.2% (28/103) in pediatric and 17.7% (268/1514) in adult patients treated with voriconazole in pooled clinical trials. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved on treatment with or without dose adjustment or after voriconazole discontinuation. A higher frequency of clinically significant liver laboratory abnormalities, irrespective of baseline laboratory values (>3x ULN ALT or AST), was consistently observed in the combined therapeutic pediatric population (15.5% AST and 22.5% ALT) when compared to adults (12.9% AST and 11.6% ALT). The incidence of bilirubin elevation was comparable between adult and pediatric patients. The incidence of hepatic abnormalities in pediatric patients is shown in Table 9.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Dermatological Reactions Increased risk of skin toxicity with concomitant use of methotrexate, a drug associated with UV reactivation, was observed in postmarketing reports [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Adults Skeletal : fluorosis and periostitis have been reported during long-term voriconazole therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.12 )] Eye disorders : prolonged visual adverse reactions, including optic neuritis and papilledema [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.4 )] Skin and Appendages: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.5 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) Endocrine disorders: adrenal insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome (when voriconazole has been used concomitantly with corticosteroids) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. Pediatric Patients There have been postmarketing reports of pancreatitis in pediatric patients."
