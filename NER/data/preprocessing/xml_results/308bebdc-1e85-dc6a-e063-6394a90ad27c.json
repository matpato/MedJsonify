    "contraindications_original": "4  CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity Anastrozole is contraindicated in any patient who has shown a hypersensitivity reaction to the drug or to any of the excipients. Observed reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and urticaria [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Patients with demonstrated hypersensitivity to anastrozole or any excipient ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS In women with pre-existing ischemic heart disease, an increased incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events occurred with anastrozole use compared to tamoxifen use. Consider risks and benefits. ( 5.1 , 6.1 ) Decreases in bone mineral density may occur. Consider bone mineral density monitoring. ( 5.2 , 6.1 ) Increases in total cholesterol may occur. Consider cholesterol monitoring. ( 5.3 , 6.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Anastrozole may cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Ischemic Cardiovascular Events In women with pre-existing ischemic heart disease, an increased  incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events was observed with anastrozole in the ATAC trial (17% of patients on anastrozole and 10% of patients on tamoxifen).  Consider risk and benefits of anastrozole therapy in patients with pre-existing ischemic heart disease [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.2  Bone Effects Results from the ATAC trial bone substudy at 12 and 24 months demonstrated that patients receiving anastrozole had a mean decrease in both lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) compared to baseline. Patients receiving tamoxifen had a mean increase in both lumbar spine and total hip BMD compared to baseline. Consider bone mineral density monitoring in patients treated with anastrozole [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.3 Cholesterol During the ATAC trial, more patients receiving anastrozole were reported to have elevated serum cholesterol compared to patients receiving tamoxifen (9% versus 3.5%, respectively) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, anastrozole can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Anastrozole caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats at maternal exposure that were 9 times the human clinical exposure, based on area under the curve (AUC). In rabbits, anastrozole caused pregnancy failure at doses equal to or greater than 16 times the recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus.

    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious adverse reactions with anastrozole occurring in less than 1 in 10,000 patients, are:  1) skin reactions such as lesions, ulcers, or blisters; 2) allergic reactions with swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and/or throat. This may cause difficulty in swallowing and/or breathing; and 3) changes in blood tests of the liver function, including inflammation of the liver with symptoms that may include a general feeling of not being well, with or without jaundice, liver pain or liver swelling [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Common adverse reactions (occurring with an incidence of ≥10%) in women taking anastrozole included: hot flashes, asthenia, arthritis, pain, arthralgia, hypertension, depression, nausea and vomiting, rash, osteoporosis, fractures, back pain, insomnia, headache, bone pain, peripheral edema, increased cough, dyspnea, pharyngitis and lymphedema. In the ATAC trial, the most common reported adverse reaction (>0.1%) leading to discontinuation of therapy for both treatment groups was hot flashes, although there were fewer patients who discontinued therapy as a result of hot flashes in the anastrozole group. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the early breast cancer (ATAC) study, the most common (occurring with an incidence of ≥10%) side effects occurring in women taking anastrozole included: hot flashes, asthenia, arthritis, pain, arthralgia, pharyngitis, hypertension, depression, nausea and vomiting, rash, osteoporosis, fractures, back pain, insomnia, headache, peripheral edema and lymphedema, regardless of causality. ( 6.1 ) In the advanced breast cancer studies, the most common (occurring with an incidence of >10%) side effects occurring in women taking anastrozole included: hot flashes, nausea, asthenia, pain, headache,  back pain, bone pain, increased cough, dyspnea, pharyngitis and peripheral edema.

The median duration of adjuvant treatment for safety evaluation was 59.8 months and 59.6 months for patients receiving anastrozole 1 mg and tamoxifen 20 mg, respectively. Adverse reactions occurring with an incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group during treatment or within 14 days of the end of treatment are presented in Table 1.

In the overall population, angina pectoris was reported in 71/3092 (2.3%) patients in the anastrozole arm and 51/3094 (1.6%) patients in the tamoxifen arm; myocardial infarction was reported in 37/3092 (1.2%) patients in the anastrozole arm and 34/3094 (1.1%) patients in the tamoxifen arm. In women with pre-existing ischemic heart disease 465/6186 (7.5%), the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events was 17% in patients on anastrozole and 10% in patients on tamoxifen.  In this patient population, angina pectoris was reported in 25/216 (11.6%) patients receiving anastrozole and 13/249 (5.2%) patients receiving tamoxifen; myocardial infarction was reported in 2/216 (0.9%) patients receiving anastrozole and 8/249 (3.2%) patients receiving tamoxifen. Bone Mineral Density Findings Results from the ATAC trial bone substudy at 12 and 24 months demonstrated that patients receiving anastrozole had a mean decrease in both lumbar spine and total hip bone mineral density (BMD) compared to baseline. Patients receiving tamoxifen had a mean increase in both lumbar spine and total hip BMD compared to baseline. Because anastrozole lowers circulating estrogen levels it may cause a reduction in bone mineral density. A post-marketing trial assessed the combined effects of anastrozole and the bisphosphonate risedronate on changes from baseline in BMD and markers of bone resorption and formation in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. All patients received calcium and vitamin D supplementation. At 12 months, small reductions in lumbar spine bone mineral density were noted in patients not receiving bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonate treatment preserved bone density in most patients at risk of fracture. Postmenopausal women with early breast cancer scheduled to be treated with anastrozole should have their bone status managed according to treatment guidelines already available for postmenopausal women at similar risk of fragility fracture. Cholesterol During the ATAC trial, more patients receiving anastrozole were reported to have an elevated serum cholesterol compared to patients receiving tamoxifen (9% versus 3.5%, respectively). A post-marketing trial also evaluated any potential effects of anastrozole on lipid profile. In the primary analysis population for lipids (anastrozole alone), there was no clinically significant change in LDL-C from baseline to 12 months and HDL-C from baseline to 12 months. In secondary population for lipids (anastrozole+risedronate), there also was no clinically significant change in LDL-C and HDL-C from baseline to 12 months. In both populations for lipids, there was no clinically significant difference in total cholesterol (TC) or serum triglycerides (TG) at 12 months compared with baseline. In this trial, treatment for 12 months with anastrozole alone had a neutral effect on lipid profile. Combination treatment with anastrozole and risedronate also had a neutral effect on lipid profile. The trial provides evidence that postmenopausal women with early breast cancer scheduled to be treated with anastrozole should be managed using the current National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines for cardiovascular risk-based management of individual patients with LDL elevations. Other Adverse Reactions Patients receiving anastrozole had an increase in joint disorders (including arthritis, arthrosis and arthralgia) compared with patients receiving tamoxifen. Patients receiving anastrozole had an increase in the incidence of all fractures  (specifically  fractures of spine, hip and wrist) [315 (10%)] compared with patients receiving tamoxifen [209 (7%)]. Patients receiving anastrozole had a higher incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome [78 (2.5%)] compared with patients receiving tamoxifen [22 (0.7%)]. Vaginal bleeding occurred more frequently in the tamoxifen-treated patients versus the anastrozole -treated patients 317 (10%) versus 167 (5%), respectively. Patients receiving anastrozole had a lower incidence of hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolic events and ischemic cerebrovascular events compared with patients receiving tamoxifen. 10-year median follow-up Safety Results from the ATAC Trial Results are consistent with the previous analyses. Serious adverse reactions were similar between anastrozole (50%) and tamoxifen (51%). Cardiovascular events were consistent with the known safety profiles of anastrozole and tamoxifen. The cumulative incidences of all first fractures (both serious and non-serious, occurring either during or after treatment) was higher in the anastrozole group (15%) compared to the tamoxifen group (11%). This increased first fracture rate during treatment did not continue in the post-treatment follow-up period. The cumulative incidence of new primary cancers was similar in the anastrozole group (13.7%) compared to the tamoxifen group (13.9%). Consistent with the previous analyses, endometrial cancer was higher in the tamoxifen group (0.8%) compared to the anastrozole group (0.2%). The overall number of deaths (during or off-trial treatment) was similar between the treatment groups. There were more deaths related to breast cancer in the tamoxifen than in the anastrozole treatment group. First-Line Therapy Adverse reactions occurring with an incidence of at least 5% in either treatment group of trials 0030 and 0027 during or within 2 weeks of the end of treatment are shown in Table 3.

Body as a Whole: Flu syndrome; fever; neck pain; malaise; accidental injury; infection Cardiovascular: Hypertension; thrombophlebitis Hepatic: Gamma GT increased; SGOT increased; SGPT increased Hematologic: Anemia; leukopenia Metabolic and Nutritional: Alkaline phosphatase increased; weight loss Mean serum total cholesterol levels increased by 0.5 mmol/L among patients receiving anastrozole.  Increases in LDL cholesterol have been shown to contribute to these changes. Musculoskeletal: Myalgia; arthralgia; pathological fracture Nervous: Somnolence; confusion; insomnia; anxiety; nervousness Respiratory: Sinusitis; bronchitis; rhinitis Skin and Appendages: Hair thinning (alopecia); pruritus Urogenital: Urinary tract infection; breast pain The incidences of the following adverse reaction groups potentially causally related to one or both of the therapies because of their pharmacology, were statistically analyzed:  weight gain, edema, thromboembolic disease, gastrointestinal disturbance, hot flushes, and vaginal dryness.  These six groups, and the adverse reactions captured in the groups, were prospectively defined.  The results are shown in the table below.
