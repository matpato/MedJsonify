Monitor more frequently during the first three months of treatment. Interrupt, reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( Provide nutritional support, fluids, and electrolyte repletion as clinically indicated. 2.5 )]. 5.4 Hyponatremia XPOVIO can cause severe or life-threatening hyponatremia [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] In patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO 100 mg once weekly (BOSTON, n=195), hyponatremia was reported in 58% of patients and Grade 3-4 hyponatremia was reported in 14% of patients. The median time to first onset was 21 days for any grade hyponatremia and the median time to first onset for Grade 3 or 4 hyponatremia was 22 days.

Correct sodium levels for concurrent hyperglycemia (serum glucose >150 mg/dL) and high serum paraprotein levels. Assess hydration status and manage hyponatremia per clinical guidelines, including intravenous saline and/or salt tablets as appropriate and dietary review. Interrupt, reduce dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of the adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. 5.5 Serious Infection XPOVIO can cause serious and fatal infections. Most of these infections were not associated with Grade 3 or higher neutropenia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. In patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO 100 mg once weekly (BOSTON, n=195), 69% of patients experienced any grade of infection. Grade â‰¥3 infections were reported in 32% of patients, and deaths from infections occurred in 3.1% of patients. The most frequently reported Grade â‰¥3 infection was pneumonia in 14% of patients, followed by sepsis in 4.1% and upper respiratory tract infection in 3.6% of patients. In patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO 80 mg twice weekly (STORM, n=202), 52% of patients experienced any grade of infection. Grade â‰¥3 infections were reported in 25% of patients, and deaths from infections occurred in 4% of patients within 30 days of last treatment. Upper respiratory tract infection of any grade occurred in 21%, pneumonia in 13%, and sepsis in 6% of patients. The most frequently reported Grade â‰¥3 infections were pneumonia in 9% of patients, followed by sepsis in 6%. The median time to onset was 54 days for pneumonia and 42 days for sepsis. In patients with DLBCL (SADAL, n=134), 25% of patients experienced Grade 3 or higher infection and 21% had an infection-related serious adverse reaction; 49% developed an infection of any grade, most frequently involving the upper or lower respiratory tract. The most frequently reported Grade â‰¥3 infections were lower respiratory tract infections in 9% of patients (including pneumonia in 6%), followed by sepsis (6%). The median time to onset of Grade â‰¥3 infection was 42 days. Atypical infections reported after XPOVIO include, but are not limited to, fungal pneumonia and herpes virus infection. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, evaluate and treat promptly. 5.6 Neurological Toxicity XPOVIO can cause life-threatening neurological toxicities [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] In patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO 100 mg once weekly (BOSTON, n=195), neurological adverse reactions (excluding peripheral neuropathy) including dizziness, syncope, depressed level of consciousness, vertigo, amnesia, and mental status changes (including delirium and confusional state) occurred in 26% of patients and severe events (Grade 3-4) occurred in 3.6% of patients. The median time to the first event was 29 days. Permanent discontinuation due to neurological adverse reactions occurred in 2.1% of patients. In patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO 80 mg twice weekly (STORM, n=202), neurological adverse reactions, including dizziness, syncope, depressed level of consciousness, and mental status changes (including delirium and confusional state) occurred in 30% of patients and severe events (Grade 3-4) occurred in 9% of patients. The median time to the first event was 15 days. In patients with DLBCL (SADAL, n=134), neurological adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients and severe events (Grade 3-4) occurred in 6% of patients treated with XPOVIO. The most frequent manifestations were dizziness (16%) and mental status changes (11%), including confusion, cognitive disorders, somnolence, hallucination, delirium, and depressed level of consciousness. Syncope occurred in 2.2% of patients. The median time to the first event was 28 days. Among patients with such neurological adverse reactions, 68% recovered with a median time to recovery of 14 days. Coadministration of XPOVIO with other products that cause dizziness or mental status changes may increase the risk of neurological toxicity. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, until the neurological toxicity fully resolves. Optimize hydration status, hemoglobin level, and concomitant medications to avoid exacerbating dizziness or mental status changes. Institute fall precautions as appropriate. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, XPOVIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Selinexor administration to pregnant animals during organogenesis resulted in structural abnormalities and alterations to growth at exposures below those occurring clinically at the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XPOVIO and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.3 )] 5.8 Cataract New onset or exacerbation of cataract has occurred during treatment with XPOVIO [see Adverse Reactions ( In patients with multiple myeloma who received XPOVIO 100 mg once weekly (BOSTON, n=195), the incidence of new onset or worsening cataracts requiring clinical intervention was reported in 22% of patients. The median time to new onset of cataract was 228 days and was 237 days for worsening of cataract in patients presenting with cataract at start of XPOVIO therapy. Treatment of cataracts usually requires surgical removal of the cataract. 6.1 )].",

Multiple Myeloma XPOVIO in Combination with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (XVd) The safety of XPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone was evaluated in BOSTON [see Clinical Studies ( Patients were randomized to receive XPOVIO 100 mg orally once weekly in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (XVd) (n=195) or bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) (n=204). Among patients who received XPOVIO, the median duration of XPOVIO treatment was 29 weeks (range: 1 to 120 weeks) and the median dose was 80 mg (range: 30 to 137 mg) per week. 14.1 )]. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients who received XPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone.

Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients within 30 days of last treatment, including pneumonia (n=3) and sepsis (n=3). Grade â‰¥2 peripheral neuropathy, a pre-specified key secondary endpoint, was lower in the XVd arm (21%) compared to the Vd arm (34%); odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.79]. The median treatment duration was 30 weeks (range: 1-120 weeks) in patients who received once weekly XVd as compared to 32 weeks (range: 1-122 weeks) in patients who received twice weekly Vd. Permanent discontinuation of XPOVIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of XPOVIO in >2% of patients included fatigue (3.6%), nausea (3.1%), thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, peripheral neuropathy, and vomiting (2.1% each).
