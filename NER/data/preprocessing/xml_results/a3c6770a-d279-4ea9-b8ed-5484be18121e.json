  "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is indicated as a source of water and electrolytes or as an alkalinizing agent.",
  "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is contraindicated in: • Newborns ( ≤28 days of age ) receiving concomitant treatment with ceftriaxone, even if separate infusion lines are used due to the risk of fatal ceftriaxone-calcium salt precipitation in the neonate’s bloodstream. • Patients older than 28 days, including adults, administered ceftriaxone simultaneously through the same infusion line ( e.g. , via a Y-connector ) . If the same infusion line is used for sequential administration, the line must be thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. • Patients with known hypersensitivity to sodium lactate ( see WARNINGS ) .",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Potassium Content The potassium concentration in Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is similar to the concentration in plasma; however, it is insufficient to produce a useful effect in case of severe potassium deficiency. Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is not recommended for the treatment of severe hypokalemia. Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP is not for treatment of lactic acidosis or severe metabolic acidosis. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction develop. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated. Electrolyte Imbalances Hyponatremia Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP may cause hyponatremia. Hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. The risk of hospital acquired hyponatremia is increased in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release ( including SIADH ) treated with high volume of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP. The risk for hyponatremia is increased in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia, and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia ( such as diuretics, certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications ) . See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and Pediatric Use . Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia such as hyponatremic encephalopathy, include pediatric patients, women ( in particular, premenopausal women ) , patients with hypoxemia, and patients with underlying central nervous system disease. Avoid Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations. Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications. Brain adaptations reducing risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury when chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected, which is known as osmotic demyelination syndrome ( ODS ) . To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications. Fluid Overload Depending on the volume and the rate of infusion, the intravenous administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP can cause electrolyte disturbances such as overhydration and congested states, including pulmonary congestion and edema. Avoid Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading. If use cannot be avoided, monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid base balance, as needed and especially during prolonged use. Hyperkalemia Potassium-containing solutions, including Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP, may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Patients at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia include those: • With conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia and/or associated with increased sensitivity to potassium, such as patients with severe renal impairment, acute dehydration, extensive tissue injury or burns, certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure. • Treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia ( see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ) . • PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions . Avoid use of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients with, or at risk for, hyperkalemia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium concentrations. Alkalosis Because lactate is metabolized to bicarbonate, administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP may result in, or worsen, metabolic alkalosis. Avoid intravenous administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients with alkalosis or at risk for alkalosis.PRECAUTIONS Patients with Renal Impairment Administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients with or at risk of severe renal impairment, may result in hyperkalemia and/or fluid overload ( see WARNINGS ) . Avoid Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients with severe renal impairment or conditions that may cause sodium and/or potassium retention, fluid overload, or edema. If use cannot be avoided, monitor patients with severe renal impairment for development of these adverse reactions. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with severe hepatic impairment, lactate metabolism may be impaired and Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP may not produce alkalinization. Consider when monitoring serum lactate levels. Hypercalcemia Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP contains calcium salts and may cause hypercalcemia. Avoid administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients with hypercalcemia or conditions predisposing to hypercalcemia; and in patients with calcium renal calculi or history of such calculi. Hyperglycemia Avoid administration of solutions containing lactate in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus, as it may result in hyperglycemia. Monitoring of Serum Lactate Levels Administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP may result in an iatrogenic increase in serum lactate levels and interfere with interpretation of serum lactate levels in patients with severe metabolic acidosis including lactic acidosis. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well controlled trials, however, the use of electrolyte solutions in the pediatric population is referenced in the medical literature. The warnings, precautions and adverse reactions identified in the label copy should be observed in the pediatric population. Administration of a lactate-containing intravenous solution to infants should take into account that the liver and kidneys are still maturing during the first year of life, which also affects the biotransformation and renal excretion of lactate. Pediatric patients are at increased risk of developing hyponatremia as well as for developing encephalopathy as a complication of hyponatremia ( see WARNINGS ) . Geriatric Use Geriatric patients are at increased risk of developing electrolyte imbalances. Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients. Drug Interactions Ceftriaxone For information on interaction with ceftriaxone – see CONTRAINDICATIONS . Other Drugs that Increase the Risk of Hyponatremia Administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to patients treated concomitantly with medications associated with hyponatremia may increase the risk of developing hyponatremia. Avoid use of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients receiving products, such as diuretics, and certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications. Drugs that increase the vasopressin effect reduce renal electrolyte free water excretion and may also increase the risk of hyponatremia following treatment with intravenous fluids. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations. Other Products that Affect Fluid and/or Electrolyte Balance Administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to patients treated concomitantly with drugs associated with sodium and fluid retention may increase the risk of hypernatremia and volume overload. Avoid use of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients receiving such products, such as corticosteroids or corticotropin. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum electrolytes, fluid balance and acid-base balance. Other Products that Cause Hyperkalemia Administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to patients treated concurrently or recently with products that are associated with hyperkalemia increases the risk of severe and potentially fatal hyperkalemia, in particular in the presence of other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Avoid use of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP to patients receiving such products ( e.g. , potassium sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, or the immunosuppressants tacrolimus and cyclosporine ) . If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium concentrations. Lithium Renal sodium and lithium clearance may be increased during administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP and result in decreased lithium concentrations. Avoid use of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients receiving lithium. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum lithium concentrations during concomitant use. Digoxin Administration of calcium may increase the effects of digitalis and lead to serious or fatal cardiac arrhythmia. In patients treated with digoxin, consider reducing the volume, and/or rate of administration of Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP. Other Drugs that Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia Avoid Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP in patients treated with thiazide diuretics or vitamin D, as these can increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Drugs with pH Dependent Renal Elimination Due to the alkalinizing action of lactate ( formation of bicarbonate ) , Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP may interfere with the elimination of drugs with pH dependent renal elimination. Renal clearance of acidic drugs may be increased. Renal clearance of alkaline drugs may be decreased.
