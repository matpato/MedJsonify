    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. Useful in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses, and in histamine-mediated pruritus. As a sedative when used as premedication and following general anesthesia, Hydroxyzine may potentiate meperidine (Demerol®) and barbiturates , so their use in pre-anesthetic adjunctive therapy should be modified on an individual basis. Atropine and other belladonna alkaloids are not affected by the drug. Hydroxyzine is not known to interfere with the action of digitalis in any way and it may be used concurrently with this agent. The effectiveness of hydroxyzine as an antianxiety agent for long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should reassess periodically the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Hydroxyzine, when administered to the pregnant mouse, rat, and rabbit, induced fetal abnormalities in the rat and mouse at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range. Clinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy. Until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QT interval. Hydroxyzine pamoate is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine products, and in patients with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine hydrochloride or levocetirizine hydrochloride.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are so excreted, hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers.PRECAUTIONS THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND BARBITURATES. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with use of the drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydroxyzine pamoate. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs, and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased. QT Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes (TdP) Cases of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported during post-marketing use of hydroxyzine. The majority of reports occurred in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation/TdP (pre-existing heart disease, electrolyte imbalances or concomitant arrhythmogenic drug use). Therefore, hydroxyzine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias. Caution is recommended during the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, certain antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, clozapine, quetiapine, chlorpromazine), certain antidepressants (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine), certain antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin); and others (e.g., pentamidine, methadone, ondansetron, droperidol). Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) Hydroxyzine may rarely cause acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a serious skin reaction characterized by fever and numerous small, superficial, non-follicular, sterile pustules, arising within large areas of edematous erythema. Inform patients about the signs of AGEP, and discontinue hydroxyzine at the first appearance of a skin rash, worsening of pre-existing skin reactions which hydroxyzine may be used to treat, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. If signs or symptoms suggest AGEP, use of hydroxyzine should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. Avoid cetirizine or levocetirizine in patients who have experienced AGEP or other hypersensitivity reactions with hydroxyzine, due to the risk of cross-sensitivity. Geriatric Use A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of hydroxyzine pamoate included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. The extent of renal excretion of hydroxyzine pamoate has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections. Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydroxyzine pamoate and observed closely.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects reported with the administration of hydroxyzine pamoate are usually mild and transitory in nature. Skin and Appendages: Oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride is associated with Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) and fixed drug eruptions in post-marketing reports. Anticholinergic: Dry mouth. Central Nervous System: Drowsiness is usually transitory and may disappear in a few days of continued therapy or upon reduction of the dose. Involuntary motor activity, including rare instances of tremor and convulsions, has been reported, usually with doses considerably higher than those recommended. Clinically significant respiratory depression has not been reported at recommended doses. Cardiac System: QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes. In post-marketing experience, the following additional undesirable effects have been reported: Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, Nervous System: headache, Psychiatric: hallucination, Skin and Appendages: pruritus, rash, urticaria.
