To prevent contaminating the dropper tip and solution, advise patients not to touch the eyelids or surrounding areas with the dropper tip of the bottle or tip of the single-use container. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Contamination of Tip and Solution As with any eye drop, care should be taken not to touch the eyelids or surrounding areas with the dropper tip of the bottle or tip of the single-use container in order to avoid injury to the eye and to prevent contaminating the tip and solution.

The preservative in ZERVIATE ® , benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Lenses may be reinserted 10 minutes following administration of ZERVIATE ® .",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates in practice. In seven clinical trials, patients with allergic conjunctivitis or those at a risk of developing allergic conjunctivitis received one drop of either cetirizine (N=511) or vehicle (N=329) in one or both eyes. The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurred in approximately 1–7% of patients treated with either ZERVIATE ® or vehicle. These reactions were ocular hyperemia, instillation site pain, and visual acuity reduced. The most common adverse reactions (1–7%) were ocular hyperemia, instillation site pain, and visual acuity reduced.
