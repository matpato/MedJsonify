( 4.1 ) 4.1 Hypersensitivity AK-FLUOR ® is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium or any other ingredients in this product.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory reactions ( 5.1 ) Severe local tissue damage ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Respiratory Reactions Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. An emergency tray should always be available. If a potential allergy is suspected, an intradermal skin test may be performed prior to intravenous administration, i.e., 0.05 mL injected intradermally to be evaluated 30 to 60 minutes following injection. Given the sensitivity and specificity of skin testing, a negative skin test is not proof that a patient is not allergic to fluorescein. 5.2 Severe local tissue damage Extravasation during injection can result in severe local tissue damage due to high pH of fluorescein solution. The following complications resulting from extravasation of fluorescein have been noted to occur: Sloughing of the skin, superficial phlebitis, subcutaneous granuloma, and toxic neuritis along the median nerve in the antecubital area. Complications resulting from extravasation can cause severe pain in the arm for up to several hours. When extravasation occurs, the injection should be discontinued and conservative measures to treat damaged tissue and to relieve pain should be implemented.
