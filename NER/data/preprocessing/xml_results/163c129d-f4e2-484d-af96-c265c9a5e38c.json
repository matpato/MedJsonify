  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ENVARSUS XR is a calcineurin-inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated for: The prophylaxis of organ rejection in de novo kidney transplant patients in combination with other immunosuppressants ( 1.1 ) The prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients converted from tacrolimus immediate-release formulations in combination with other immunosuppressants ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection in De Novo Kidney Transplant Patients ENVARSUS XR is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients in combination with other immunosuppressants [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . 1.2 Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection in Stable Kidney Transplant Patients Converting from Immediate-Release Formulations ENVARSUS XR is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients converted from tacrolimus immediate-release formulations, in combination with other immunosuppressants [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] .",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ENVARSUS XR is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or to any of the ingredients in ENVARSUS XR. Known hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or any of the ingredients ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Not Interchangeable with Other Tacrolimus Products: Instruct patients or caregivers to recognize appearance of ENVARSUS XR tablets. ( 5.3 ) New Onset Diabetes after Transplant: Monitor blood glucose. ( 5.4 ) Nephrotoxicity ( acute and/or chronic ) : May occur due to ENVARSUS XR, drug interactions or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Monitor renal function and tacrolimus blood concentrations; consider dosage reduction or temporary interruption of ENVARSUS. ( 5.5 ) Neurotoxicity: Including risk of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) ; monitor for neurologic abnormalities; reduce dosage or discontinue ENVARSUS XR. ( 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Risk may be increased with other agents associated with hyperkalemia; monitor serum potassium levels. ( 5.7 ) Hypertension: May require antihypertensive therapy; monitor relevant drug interactions. ( 5.8 ) QT Prolongation: Consider obtaining electrocardiograms and monitoring electrolytes in patients at high risk. ( 5.10 ) Immunizations: Avoid live vaccines. ( 5.11 ) Pure Red Cell Aplasia: Consider discontinuation. ( 5.12 ) Thrombotic Microangiopathy, Including Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: May occur, especially in patients with infections and certain concomitant medications. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies Immunosuppressants, including ENVARSUS XR, increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin. The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. Examine patients for skin changes and advise to avoid or limit exposure to sunlight and UV light by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) , associated with Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) , has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant patients. The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative. Monitor EBV serology during treatment. 5.2 Serious Infections Immunosuppressants, including ENVARSUS XR, increase the risk of developing bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections, including opportunistic infections. These infections may lead to serious, including fatal, outcomes. Serious viral infections reported include: Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy ( especially due to BK virus infection ) , JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , and Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infections: CMV seronegative transplant patients who receive an organ from a CMV seropositive donor are at highest risk of CMV viremia and CMV disease. Monitor for the development of infection and adjust the immunosuppressive regimen to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of infection [see . ] Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) 5.3 Not Interchangeable with Other Tacrolimus Products-Medication Errors Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between tacrolimus capsules and tacrolimus extended-release capsules were reported outside the U.S. This led to serious adverse reactions, including graft rejection, or other adverse reactions due to under- or over-exposure to tacrolimus. ENVARSUS XR is not interchangeable or substitutable with tacrolimus extended-release capsules, tacrolimus capsules or tacrolimus for oral suspension. Instruct patients and caregivers to recognize the appearance of ENVARSUS XR tablet [see and to confirm with their healthcare provider if a different product is dispensed or if dosing instructions have changed. Dosage Forms and Strengths ( 3 ) ] 5.4 New Onset Diabetes after Transplant ENVARSUS XR caused new onset diabetes after transplant ( NODAT ) in kidney transplant patients, which may be reversible in some patients. African-American and Hispanic kidney transplant patients are at an increased risk. Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat appropriately [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 ) ] 5.5 Nephrotoxicity due to ENVARSUS XR and Drug Interactions ENVARSUS XR, like other calcineurin-inhibitors, can cause acute or chronic nephrotoxicity in transplant patients due to its vasoconstrictive effect on renal vasculature, toxic tubulopathy and tubular-interstitial effects. Acute renal impairment associated with tacrolimus toxicity can result in high serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, decreased secretion of urea and hyperuricemia, and is usually reversible. In patients with elevated serum creatinine and tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations greater than the recommended range, consider dosage reduction or temporary interruption of tacrolimus administration. The risk for nephrotoxicity may increase when ENVARSUS XR is concomitantly administered with CYP3 A inhibitors ( by increasing tacrolimus whole blood concentrations ) or drugs associated with nephrotoxicity ( e.g. , aminoglycosides, ganciclovir, amphotericin B, cisplatin, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors ) . When tacrolimus is used concurrently with CYP3 A inhibitors or other known nephrotoxic drugs, monitor renal function and tacrolimus blood concentrations, and adjust dose of both tacrolimus and/or concomitant medications during concurrent use [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] . 5.6 Neurotoxicity ENVARSUS XR may cause a spectrum of neurotoxicities. The most severe neurotoxicities include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) , delirium, seizure, and coma; others include tremors, paresthesias, headache, mental status changes, and changes in motor and sensory functions [see Adverse Reactions ( As symptoms may be associated with tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations at or above the recommended range, monitor for neurologic symptoms and consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of ENVARSUS XR if neurotoxicity occurs. 6.1 , 6.2 ) ] . 5.7 Hyperkalemia Mild to severe hyperkalemia, which may require treatment, has been reported with tacrolimus including ENVARSUS XR. Concomitant use of agents associated with hyperkalemia ( e.g. , potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers ) may increase the risk for hyperkalemia [see Monitor serum potassium levels periodically during treatment. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . 5.8 Hypertension Hypertension is a common adverse reaction of ENVARSUS XR therapy and may require antihypertensive therapy [see . Some antihypertensive drugs can increase the risk for hyperkalemia Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] [see . Calcium-channel blocking agents may increase tacrolimus blood concentrations and require dosage reduction of ENVARSUS XR Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] 5.9 Risk of Rejection with Strong CYP3 A Inducers and Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions with Strong CYP3 A Inhibitors The concomitant use of strong CYP3 A inducers may increase the metabolism of tacrolimus, leading to lower whole blood trough concentrations and greater risk of rejection. In contrast, the concomitant use of strong CYP3 A inhibitors may decrease the metabolism of tacrolimus, leading to higher whole blood trough concentrations and greater risk of serious adverse reactions ( e.g. , neurotoxicity, QT prolongation ) [see Therefore, adjust ENVARSUS XR dose and monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations when co-administering ENVARSUS XR with strong CYP3 A inhibitors ( e.g. , including but not limited to telaprevir, boceprevir, ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin ) or strong CYP3 A inducers ( e.g. , including but not limited to rifampin, rifabutin ) Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 , 5.10 ) ] . [see . A rapid, sharp rise in tacrolimus levels has been reported after co-administration with strong CYP3 A4 inhibitors despite an initial reduction of tacrolimus dose. Early and frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough levels is recommended Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 , 2.5 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] . 5.10 QT Prolongation ENVARSUS XR may prolong the QT/QTc interval and cause Torsades de pointes . Avoid ENVARSUS XR in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. Consider obtaining electrocardiograms and monitoring electrolytes ( magnesium, potassium, calcium ) periodically during treatment in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, those taking certain antiarrhythmic medications or other products that lead to QT prolongation, and those with electrolyte disturbances ( e.g. , hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hypomagnesemia ) . When co-administering ENVARSUS XR with other substrates and/or inhibitors of CYP3 A, especially those that also have the potential to prolong the QT interval, a reduction in ENVARSUS XR dosage, monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations, and monitoring for QT prolongation is recommended [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] 5.11 Immunizations Whenever possible, administer the complete complement of vaccines before transplantation and treatment with ENVARSUS XR. Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during treatment with ENVARSUS XR ( e.g. , intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21 a typhoid vaccines ) . Inactivated vaccines noted to be safe for administration after transplantation may not be sufficiently immunogenic during treatment with ENVARSUS XR. 5.12 Pure Red Cell Aplasia Cases of pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus. All of these patients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection, underlying disease, or concomitant medications associated with PRCA. A mechanism for tacrolimus-induced PRCA has not been elucidated. If PRCA is diagnosed, consider discontinuation of ENVARSUS XR. 5.13 Cannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and ENVARSUS XR are co-administered, closely monitor for an increase in tacrolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of tacrolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of ENVARSUS XR should be considered as needed when ENVARSUS XR is co-administered with cannabidiol [ see ] . Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 , 2.5 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) 5.14 Thrombotic Microangiopathy ( TMA ) Including Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) , including hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) , have been reported in patients treated with ENVARSUS XR. TMA may have a multifactorial etiology. Risk factors for TMA that can occur in transplant patients include, for example, severe infections, graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) mismatch, the use of calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitors. These risk factors may, either alone or combined, contribute to the risk of TMA. In patients with signs and symptoms of TMA, consider ENVARSUS XR as a risk factor. Concurrent use of ENVARSUS XR and mTOR inhibitors may contribute to the risk of TMA.",

In addition, the clinical studies were not designed to establish comparative differences across study arms with regards to the adverse reactions discussed below. Study 1- Phase 3 Clinical Study in De Novo Kidney Transplant Recipients Study 1 ( NCT 01187953 ) , was a Phase 3 randomized study in de novo kidney transplant patients that were treated with ENVARSUS XR ( N=268 ) or tacrolimus [immediate-release] capsules ( N=275 ) and concomitant immunosuppressants in a double-blind, randomized, multinational study [see The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 8.6% and 9.8% in the ENVARSUS XR and tacrolimus capsules treatment groups, respectively, through 12 months of treatment. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of study drug in the ENVARSUS XR treatment group were esophagitis, polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, graft dysfunction, complications of transplanted kidney, and diabetes mellitus, each resulting in 0.7% discontinuations among ENVARSUS XR treatment patients. In Study 1, de novo kidney transplant patients who received a starting dose of 0.17 mg/kg/day, which is higher than the recommended ENVARSUS XR starting dose of 0.14 mg/kg/day, exceeded the recommended target tacrolimus trough concentrations as high as 57 ng/mL during the first 1 to 2 weeks post-transplant Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . Infections The overall incidence of infections, serious infections, and infections with identified etiology reported in de novo kidney transplant recipients treated with ENVARSUS XR or tacrolimus [immediate-release] capsules in Study 1 are shown in Table 2 .

The study was conducted in the US and patients received an organ from a deceased or living donor. Pharmacokinetics were evaluated during the first 2 weeks with an additional 50-week treatment and follow-up to evaluate safety and efficacy [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . The starting dosage was 0.14 mg/kg/day ( given once daily ) for ENVARSUS XR and 0.2 mg/kg/day ( given twice daily ) for tacrolimus [immediate-release] capsules. On Day 2 predose, the proportion of patients in the ENVARSUS XR group with tacrolimus trough concentration that were within, above, and below 6 to 11 ng/mL was 53% , 11% , and 37% , respectively. The starting dose of 0.14 mg/kg/day in Study 2 formed the basis of dosing recommendations in de novo kidney transplant patients. There were no deaths or graft failures in Study 2. Two patients in each arm discontinued due to adverse events. The most common adverse reactions included infections and cardiovascular events, and were generally similar to those reported in Study 1. Study 3- Phase 3 Clinical Studies in Stable Kidney Transplant Recipients Converted from Tacrolimus Capsules In Study 3 ( NCT00817206 ) stable kidney transplant patients were treated with ENVARSUS XR ( N=162 ) or tacrolimus [immediate-release] capsules ( N=162 ) and concomitant immunosuppressants in an open-label, randomized, multinational study [see The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 7.4% and 1.2% in the ENVARSUS XR and tacrolimus capsules treatment groups, respectively, through 12 months of treatment. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of study drug in the ENVARSUS XR treatment group was cardiac arrest ( 2 events ) . Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] .
