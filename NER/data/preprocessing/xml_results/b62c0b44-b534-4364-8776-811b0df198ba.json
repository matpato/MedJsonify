    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE DAPZURA RT is a lipopeptide antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: • Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in adult and pediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age) ( 1.1 ) and, • Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia), in adult patients including those with right-sided infective endocarditis, ( 1.2 ) • Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia) in pediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age). ( 1.3 ) Limitations of Use: • DAPZURA RT is not indicated for the treatment of pneumonia. ( 1.4 ) • DAPZURA RT is not indicated for the treatment of left-sided infective endocarditis due to S. aureus . ( 1.4 ) • DAPZURA RT is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than one year of age due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs. ( 1.4 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of DAPZURA RT and other antibacterial drugs, DAPZURA RT should be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.5 ) 1.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (cSSSI) DAPZURA RT is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age) with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of the following Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only). 1.2 Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infections (Bacteremia) in Adult Patients, Including Those with Right-Sided Infective Endocarditis, Caused by Methicillin-Susceptible and Methicillin-Resistant Isolates DAPZURA RT is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia), including adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates. 1.3 Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infections (Bacteremia) in Pediatric Patients (1 to 17 Years of Age) DAPZURA RT is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age) with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia). 1.4 Limitations of Use DAPZURA RT is not indicated for the treatment of pneumonia. DAPZURA RT is not indicated for the treatment of left-sided infective endocarditis due to S. aureus . The clinical trial of daptomycin for injection in adult patients with S. aureus bloodstream infections included limited data from patients with left-sided infective endocarditis; outcomes in these patients were poor [see Daptomycin for injection has not been studied in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. DAPZURA RT is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] 1.5 Usage Appropriate specimens for microbiological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative pathogens and to determine their susceptibility to daptomycin. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of DAPZURA RT and other antibacterial drugs, DAPZURA RT should be used only to prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information is available, it should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Empiric therapy may be initiated while awaiting test results.",

( 5.6 ) • Potential nervous system and/or muscular system effects in pediatric patients younger than 12 months: Avoid use of DAPZURA RT in this age group. ( 5.7 ) • Clostridioides difficile– associated diarrhea: Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.8 ) • Persisting or relapsing S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis: Perform susceptibility testing and rule out sequestered foci of infection. ( 5.9 ) • Decreased efficacy was observed in adult patients with moderate baseline renal impairment. ( 5.10 ) • Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI): DAPZURA RT contains sorbitol. Risk of metabolic crisis with life-threatening hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic failure. Obtain history of HFI symptoms in pediatric patients before DAPZURA RT administration ( 5.11 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including daptomycin for injection, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to DAPZURA RT occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.2 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of daptomycin for injection. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Patients receiving DAPZURA RT should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive DAPZURA RT, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with DAPZURA RT. In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when daptomycin for injection was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, DAPZURA RT should not be dosed more frequently than once a day. DAPZURA RT should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels >1,000 U/L (~5× ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels >2,000 U/L (≥10× ULN). In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving DAPZURA RT [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.3 Eosinophilic Pneumonia Eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported in patients receiving daptomycin for injection [see In reported cases associated with daptomycin for injection, patients developed fever, dyspnea with hypoxic respiratory insufficiency, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates or organizing pneumonia. In general, patients developed eosinophilic pneumonia 2 to 4 weeks after starting daptomycin for injection and improved when daptomycin for injection was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Recurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia upon re-exposure has been reported. Patients who develop these signs and symptoms while receiving DAPZURA RT should undergo prompt medical evaluation, and DAPZURA RT should be discontinued immediately. Treatment with systemic steroids is recommended. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) DRESS has been reported in post-marketing experience with daptomycin for injection [see . Patients who develop skin rash, fever, peripheral eosinophilia, and systemic organ (for example, hepatic, renal, pulmonary) impairment while receiving DAPZURA RT should undergo medical evaluation. If DRESS is suspected, discontinue DAPZURA RT promptly and institute appropriate treatment. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.5 Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (TIN) TIN has been reported in post-marketing experience with daptomycin for injection [see . Patients who develop new or worsening renal impairment while receiving DAPZURA RT should undergo medical evaluation. If TIN is suspected, discontinue DAPZURA RT promptly and institute appropriate treatment Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.6 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported during the daptomycin for injection postmarketing experience [see Therefore, physicians should be alert to signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving DAPZURA RT. Monitor for neuropathy and consider discontinuation. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.7 Potential Nervous System and/or Muscular System Effects in Pediatric Patients Younger than 12 Months Avoid use of DAPZURA RT in pediatric patients younger than 12 months due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs with intravenous daptomycin [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. 5.8 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile –associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including daptomycin for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis [see Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, since these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.9 Persisting or Relapsing S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis Patients with persisting or relapsing S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis or poor clinical response should have repeat blood cultures. If a blood culture is positive for S. aureus , minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility testing of the isolate should be performed using a standardized procedure, and diagnostic evaluation of the patient should be performed to rule out sequestered foci of infection. Appropriate surgical intervention (e.g., debridement, removal of prosthetic devices, valve replacement surgery) and/or consideration of a change in antibacterial regimen may be required. Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis may be due to reduced daptomycin susceptibility (as evidenced by increasing MIC of the S. aureus isolate) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 5.10 Decreased Efficacy in Patients with Moderate Baseline Renal Impairment Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding clinical efficacy of daptomycin for injection treatment in adult patients with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) <50 mL/min; only 31/534 (6%) patients treated with daptomycin for injection in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CL CR <50 mL/min. Table 5 shows the number of adult patients by renal function and treatment group who were clinical successes in the Phase 3 cSSSI trials. Table 5. Clinical Success Rates by Renal Function and Treatment Group in Phase 3 cSSSI Trials in Adult Patients (Population: ITT) CL CR Success Rate n/N (%) Daptomycin for Injection 4 mg/kg every 24h Comparator 50- 70 mL/min 25/38 (66%) 30/48 (63%) 30-<50 mL/min 7/15 (47%) 20/35 (57%) In a subgroup analysis of the ITT population in the Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, clinical success rates, as determined by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee [see , in the daptomycin for injection-treated adult patients were lower in patients with baseline CL Clinical Studies (14.2) ] CR <50 mL/min (see Table 6 ). A decrease of the magnitude shown in Table 6 was not observed in comparator-treated patients. Table 6.

The minimum amount of sorbitol at which serious adverse reactions may occur in these patients is not known. Obtain a careful history of HFI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) with sorbitol/fructose/sucrose exposure prior to DAPZURA RT administration because a diagnosis of HFI may not yet be established in pediatric patients [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.12 Increased International Normalized Ratio (INR)/Prolonged Prothrombin Time Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 5.13 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing DAPZURA RT in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",

Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Clinical trials enrolled 1,864 adult patients treated with daptomycin for injection and 1,416 treated with comparator. Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trials in Adults In Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials in adult patients, daptomycin for injection was discontinued in 15/534 (2.8%) patients due to an adverse reaction, while comparator was discontinued in 17/558 (3.0%) patients. The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by body system, observed in adult patients with cSSSI (receiving 4 mg/kg daptomycin for injection) are displayed in Table 7 . Table 7.

Serious Gram-negative infections (including bloodstream infections) were reported in 10/120 (8.3%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients and 0/115 comparator-treated patients. Comparator-treated patients received dual therapy that included initial gentamicin for 4 days. Infections were reported during treatment and during early and late follow-up. Gram-negative infections included cholangitis, alcoholic pancreatitis, sternal osteomyelitis/mediastinitis, bowel infarction, recurrent Crohn’s disease, recurrent line sepsis, and recurrent urosepsis caused by a number of different Gram-negative bacteria. The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by System Organ Class (SOC), observed in adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis (receiving 6 mg/kg daptomycin for injection) are displayed in Table 8 .

These differences were due to lack of therapeutic effectiveness of daptomycin for injection in the treatment of CAP in patients experiencing these adverse events [see Indications and Usage (1.4) ]. Laboratory Changes in Adults Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trials in Adults In Phase 3 cSSSI trials of adult patients receiving daptomycin for injection at a dose of 4 mg/kg, elevations in CPK were reported as clinical adverse events in 15/534 (2.8%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients, compared with 10/558 (1.8%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 534 patients treated with daptomycin for injection, 1 (0.2%) had symptoms of muscle pain or weakness associated with CPK elevations to greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The symptoms resolved within 3 days and CPK returned to normal within 7 to 10 days after treatment was discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Table 9 summarizes the CPK shifts from Baseline through End of Therapy in the cSSSI adult trials. Table 9.

S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis Trial in Adults In the S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial in adult patients, at a dose of 6 mg/kg, 11/120 (9.2%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients, including two patients with baseline CPK levels >500 U/L, had CPK elevations to levels >500 U/L, compared with 1/116 (0.9%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 11 daptomycin for injection-treated patients, 4 had prior or concomitant treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Three of these 11 daptomycin for injection-treated patients discontinued therapy due to CPK elevation, while the one comparator-treated patient did not discontinue therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Patients Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trial in Pediatric Patients The safety of daptomycin for injection was evaluated in one clinical trial (in cSSSI), which included 256 pediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age) treated with intravenous daptomycin for injection and 133 patients treated with comparator agents. Patients were given age-dependent doses once daily for a treatment period of up to 14 days (median treatment period was 3 days). The doses given by age group were as follows: 10mg/kg for 1 to < 2 years, 9 mg/kg for 2 to 6 years, 7mg/kg for 7 to 11 years and 5 mg/kg for 12 to 17 years of age [see . Patients treated with daptomycin for injection were (51%) male, (49%) female and (46%) Caucasian and (32%) Asian. Clinical Studies (14) ] Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the cSSSI study, daptomycin for injection was discontinued in 7/256 (2.7%) patients due to an adverse reaction, while comparator was discontinued in 7/133 (5.3%) patients. Most Common Adverse Reactions The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by body system, observed in these pediatric patients with cSSSI are displayed in Table 10 . Table 10.

S. aureus Bacteremia Trial in Pediatric Patients The safety of daptomycin for injection was evaluated in one clinical trial (in S. aureus bacteremia), which treated 55 pediatric patients with intravenous daptomycin for injection and 26 patients with comparator agents. Patients were given age-dependent doses once daily for a treatment period of up to 42 days (mean duration of IV treatment was 12 days). The doses by age group were as follows: 12 mg/kg for 1 to <6 years, 9 mg/kg for 7 to 11 years and 7 mg/kg for 12 to 17 years of age [see . Patients treated with daptomycin for injection were (69%) male and (31%) female. No patients 1 to <2 years of age were enrolled. Clinical Studies (14) ] Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the bacteremia study, daptomycin for injection was discontinued in 3/55 (5.5%) patients due to an adverse reaction, while comparator was discontinued in 2/26 (7.7%) patients.
