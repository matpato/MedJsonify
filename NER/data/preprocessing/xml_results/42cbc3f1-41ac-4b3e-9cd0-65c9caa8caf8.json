  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are contraindicated in patients with: severe renal impairment ( eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . hypersensitivity to empagliflozin, metformin HCl or any of the excipients in SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, reactions such as angioedema have occurred [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] Severe renal impairment ( eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) ( 4 ) Metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis ( 4 ) Hypersensitivity to empagliflozin, metformin HCl or any of the excipients in SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis: Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk of ketoacidosis, as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels and discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR if ketoacidosis is suspected. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting. ( 5.2 ) Volume Depletion: Before initiating SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, assess volume status and renal function in patients with impaired renal function, elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. ( 5.3 ) Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated. ( 5.4 ) Hypoglycemia: Adult patients taking an insulin secretagogue or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients 10 years of age and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher regardless of insulin use. Consider lowering the dosage of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. ( 5.5 ) Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum ( Fournier's Gangrene ) : Serious, life-threatening cases have occurred in both females and males. Assess patients presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise. If suspected, institute prompt treatment. ( 5.6 ) Genital Mycotic Infections: Monitor and treat as appropriate. ( 5.7 ) Lower Limb Amputation: Monitor patients for infections or ulcers of lower limbs, and institute appropriate treatment. ( 5.8 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions ( e.g. , angioedema ) have occurred with empagliflozin. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.9 ) Vitamin B Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 Deficiency: 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations ( >5 mmol/Liter ) , anion gap acidosis ( without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia ) , and an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. In SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin ( metformin is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions ) . Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery . Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see : Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] Before initiating SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) . SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment ( e.g. , the elderly ) , renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see . Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] Radiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States: Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure ( particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia ) . Cardiovascular collapse ( shock ) , acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. Excessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, empagliflozin, a component of SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose co-transporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo and fatal ketoacidosis has occurred with empagliflozin. SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders ( e.g. , history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery ) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse. Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis ( e.g. , less than 250 mg/dL ) . Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR [see ; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors. Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. Withhold SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur. 5.3 Volume Depletion Empagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see . There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function ( eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 2 ) , elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, and renal function after initiating therapy. 5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving empagliflozin. Treatment with empagliflozin increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] 5.5 Hypoglycemia Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia. In adult patients, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased when SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR is used in combination with insulin secretagogues ( e.g. , sulfonylurea ) or insulin. In pediatric patients aged 10 years and older, the risk of hypoglycemia was higher with empagliflozin regardless of insulin use [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea ( or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues ) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications and pediatric patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum ( Fournier's Gangrene ) Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum ( Fournier's gangrene ) , a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control. 5.7 Genital Mycotic Infections Empagliflozin increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [see . Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat as appropriate. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.8 Lower Limb Amputation In some clinical studies with SGLT2 inhibitors an imbalance in the incidence of lower limb amputation has been observed. Across four empagliflozin outcome trials, lower limb amputation event rates were 4.3 and 5.0 events per 1.000 patient-years in the placebo group and the empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg dose group, respectively, with a HR of 1.05 ( 95% CI ) ( 0.81, 1.36 ) . In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial with empagliflozin, in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1.000 patient-years in the placebo, and empagliflozin 10 mg treatment arms, respectively. Amputation of the toe and mid-foot were most frequent ( 21 out of 28 empagliflozin 10 mg treated patients with lower limb amputations ) , and some involving above and below the knee. Some patients had multiple amputations. Peripheral artery disease, and diabetic foot infection ( including osteomyelitis ) , were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. The risk of amputation was highest in patients with a baseline history of diabetic foot, peripheral artery disease ( including previous amputation ) or diabetes. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR for signs and symptoms of diabetic foot infection ( including osteomyelitis ) , new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and institute appropriate treatment. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions ( e.g. , angioedema ) in patients treated with empagliflozin. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to empagliflozin or any of the excipients in SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) ] 5.10 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In metformin HCl clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of metformin-treated patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals ( those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption ) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on SYNJARDY or SYNJARDY XR and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] .",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Volume Depletion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum ( Fournier's Gangrene ) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Genital Mycotic Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] Lower Limb Amputation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] Vitamin B 12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ] Most common adverse reactions associated with empagliflozin ( 5% or greater incidence ) were urinary tract infections and female genital mycotic infections. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions associated with metformin HCl ( >5% ) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache.

The safety of concomitantly administered empagliflozin ( daily dosage 10 mg or 25 mg ) and metformin HCl ( mean daily dosage of approximately 1.800 mg ) has been evaluated in 3.456 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 16 to 24 weeks, of which 926 patients received placebo, 1.271 patients received a daily dosage of empagliflozin 10 mg, and 1.259 patients received a daily dosage of empagliflozin 25 mg. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events across treatment groups was 3.0% , 2.8% , and 2.9% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Adverse Reactions in a Clinical Trial with Empagliflozin ( Add-On Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl and Sulfonylurea ) for Glycemic Control in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In a 24-week placebo-controlled trial of empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg administered once daily added to metformin HCl and sulfonylurea, adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of empagliflozin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients are presented in Table 1 ( see also Table 4 ) . Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥5% of Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treated with Empagliflozin added on to Metformin HCl plus Sulfonylurea and Greater than with Placebo in a 24-week Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions Placebo ( % ) n=225 Empagliflozin 10 mg ( % ) n=224 Empagliflozin 25 mg ( % ) n=217 Hypoglycemia 9.8 15.6 12.9 Urinary tract infection 6.7 9.4 6.9 Nasopharyngitis 4.9 8.0 6.0 Empagliflozin Clinical Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The data in Table 2 are derived from a pool of four 24-week placebo-controlled trials and 18-week data from a placebo-controlled trial with basal insulin in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Empagliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in four trials [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] These data reflect exposure of 1.976 adult patients to empagliflozin with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks. Patients received placebo ( N=995 ) , empagliflozin 10 mg ( N=999 ) , or empagliflozin 25 mg ( N=977 ) once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 3% were older than 75 years of age. More than half ( 55% ) of the population was male; 46% were White, 50% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, 57% of the population had diabetes mellitus more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1 c ( HbA1 c ) of 8% . Established microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus at baseline included diabetic nephropathy ( 7% ) , retinopathy ( 8% ) , or neuropathy ( 16% ) . Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91% of patients and moderately impaired in 9% of patients ( mean eGFR 86.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) . Table 2 shows adverse reactions ( excluding hypoglycemia ) that were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly in empagliflozin-treated patients than placebo-treated patients, and occurred in greater than or equal to 2% of empagliflozin-treated patients.

Volume Depletion Empagliflozin causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion. In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, adverse reactions related to volume depletion ( e.g. , blood pressure ( ambulatory ) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope ) were reported by 0.3% , 0.5% , and 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Empagliflozin may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 ) ] . Increased Urination In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials in adults, adverse reactions of increased urination ( e.g. , polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia ) occurred more frequently on empagliflozin than on placebo ( see Table 2 ) . Specifically, nocturia was reported by 0.4% , 0.3% , and 0.8% of patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Hypoglycemia in Clinical Trials with Empagliflozin for Glycemic Control in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The incidence of hypoglycemia in adults by trial is shown in Table 3. The incidence of hypoglycemia increased when empagliflozin was administered with insulin or sulfonylurea.

Discontinuation from trial due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with either empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg. Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients ( see Table 2 ) . Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg ( less than 0.1% ) and empagliflozin 25 mg ( 0.1% ) than placebo ( 0% ) . Urinary Tract Infections : In the pool of five placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of urinary tract infections ( e.g. , urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis ) was increased in patients treated with empagliflozin compared to placebo ( see Table 2 ) . Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0.1% , 0.2% , and 0.1% for placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients. The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 16.6% , 18.4% , and 17.0% , respectively. The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg was 3.2% , 3.6% , and 4.1% , respectively [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] Lower Limb Amputations : Across four empagliflozin outcome trials, lower limb amputation event rates were 4.3 and 5.0 events per 1.000 patient-years in the placebo group and the empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg dose group, respectively, with a HR of 1.05 ( 95% CI ) ( 0.81, 1.36 ) . In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial with empagliflozin, in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1.000 patient-years in the placebo, and empagliflozin 10 mg treatment arms, respectively. Clinical Trial of Empagliflozin in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 to 17 Years with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Empagliflozin was administered to 52 patients in a trial of 157 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a mean exposure to empagliflozin of 23.8 weeks [see . Background therapies as adjunct to diet and exercise included metformin HCl ( 51% ) , a combination of metformin HCl and insulin ( 40.1% ) , insulin ( 3.2% ) , or none ( 5.7% ) . The mean HbA1 c at baseline was 8.0% and the mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 2.1 years. The mean age was 14.5 years ( range: 10-17 years ) and 51.6% were aged 15 years and older. Approximately, 50% were White, 6% were Asian, 31% were Black or African American, and 38% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 36.0 kg/m Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] 2 and mean BMI Z-score was 3.0. Approximately 25% of the trial population had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria. The risk of hypoglycemia was higher in pediatric patients treated with empagliflozin regardless of concomitant insulin use. Hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose <54 mg/dL, occurred in 10 ( 19.2% ) patients and in 4 ( 7.5% ) patients treated with empagliflozin and placebo, respectively. No severe hypoglycemic events occurred ( severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon or take other corrective actions ) . Adverse Reactions with Clinical Trials of Metformin HCl The most common ( >5% ) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin HCl therapy are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. In a 24-week clinical trial in which extended-release metformin HCl or placebo was added to glyburide therapy, the most common ( >5% and greater than placebo ) adverse reactions in the combined treatment group were hypoglycemia ( 13.7% vs 4.9% ) , diarrhea ( 12.5% vs 5.6% ) , and nausea ( 6.7% vs 4.2% ) . Pediatric Patients In clinical trials with metformin HCl immediate-release tablets in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the profile of adverse reactions was similar to that observed in adults. Laboratory Test Abnormalities in Clinical Trials of Empagliflozin or Metformin HCl Empagliflozin Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in eGFR: Initiation of empagliflozin causes an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy and then these changes stabilize. In a trial of adults with moderate renal impairment, larger mean changes were observed. In a long-term CV outcomes trial, the increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR generally did not exceed 0.1 mg/dL and -9.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , respectively, at Week 4, and reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with empagliflozin. Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ( LDL-C ) : Dose-related increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) were observed in adults treated with empagliflozin. LDL-C increased by 2.3% , 4.6% , and 6.5% in patients treated with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. The range of mean baseline LDL-C levels was 90.3 to 90.6 mg/dL across treatment groups. Increase in Hematocrit: In a pool of four placebo-controlled trials in adults, median hematocrit decreased by 1.3% in placebo and increased by 2.8% in empagliflozin 10 mg and 2.8% in empagliflozin 25 mg treated patients. At the end of treatment, 0.6% , 2.7% , and 3.5% of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 25 mg, respectively. Metformin HCl Decrease in Vitamin B In metformin HCl clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 : 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
