  "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sucralfate Oral Suspension is indicated in the short-term ( up to 8 weeks ) treatment of active duodenal ulcer.",
  "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Sucralfate Oral Suspension is contraindicated for patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to the active substance or to any of the excipients.",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Fatal complications, including pulmonary and cerebral emboli have occurred with inappropriate intravenous administration of Sucralfate Oral Suspension. Administer Sucralfate Oral Suspension only by the oral route. Do not administer intravenously.PRECAUTIONS The physician should read the “ PRECAUTIONS ” section when considering the use of Sucralfate Oral Suspension in pregnant or pediatric patients, or patients of childbearing potential. Duodenal ulcer is a chronic, recurrent disease. While short-term treatment with sucralfate can result in complete healing of the ulcer, a successful course of treatment with sucralfate should not be expected to alter the post healing frequency or severity of duodenal ulceration. Episodes of hyperglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients. Close monitoring of glycemia in diabetic patients treated with Sucralfate Oral Suspension is recommended. Adjustment of the anti-diabetic treatment dose during the use of Sucralfate Oral Suspension might be necessary. Special Populations: Chronic Renal Failure and Dialysis Patients When sucralfate is administered orally, small amounts of aluminum are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Concomitant use of sucralfate with other products that contain aluminum, such as aluminum-containing antacids, may increase the total body burden of aluminum. Patients with normal renal function receiving the recommended doses of sucralfate and aluminum-containing products adequately excrete aluminum in the urine. Patients with chronic renal failure or those receiving dialysis have impaired excretion of absorbed aluminum. In addition, aluminum does not cross dialysis membranes because it is bound to albumin and transferrin plasma proteins. Aluminum accumulation and toxicity ( aluminum osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, encephalopathy ) have been described in patients with renal impairment. Sucralfate should be used with caution in patients with chronic renal failure. Drug Interactions Some studies have shown that simultaneous sucralfate administration in healthy volunteers reduced the extent of absorption ( bioavailability ) of single doses of the following: cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ketoconazole, l-thyroxine, phenytoin, quinidine, ranitidine, tetracycline, and theophylline. Subtherapeutic prothrombin times with concomitant warfarin and sucralfate therapy have been reported in spontaneous and published case reports. However, two clinical studies have demonstrated no change in either serum warfarin concentration or prothrombin time with the addition of sucralfate to chronic warfarin therapy. The mechanism of these interactions appears to be nonsystemic in nature, presumably resulting from sucralfate binding to the concomitant agent in the gastrointestinal tract. In all cases studied to date ( cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine ) , dosing the concomitant medication 2 hours before sucralfate eliminated the interaction. Due to Sucralfate Oral Suspension's potential to alter the absorption of some drugs, Sucralfate Oral Suspension should be administered separately from other drugs when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical. In these cases, patients should be monitored appropriately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Chronic oral toxicity studies of 24 months' duration were conducted in mice and rats at doses up to 1 g/kg ( 12 times the human dose ) . There was no evidence of drug-related tumorigenicity. A reproduction study in rats at doses up to 38 times the human dose did not reveal any indication of fertility impairment. Mutagenicity studies were not conducted. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Teratogenicity studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to 50 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to sucralfate. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when sucralfate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Sucralfate Oral Suspension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy ( see ) . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function ( see PRECAUTIONS; Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

  "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to sucralfate tablets in clinical trials were minor and only rarely led to discontinuation of the drug. In studies involving over 2700 patients treated with sucralfate, adverse effects were reported in 129 ( 4.7% ) . Constipation was the most frequent complaint ( 2% ) . Other adverse effects reported in less than 0.5% of the patients are listed below by body system: Gastrointestinal : diarrhea, dry mouth, flatulence, gastric discomfort, indigestion, nausea, vomiting Dermatological : pruritus, rash Nervous System : dizziness, insomnia, sleepiness, vertigo Other : back pain, headache Post-marketing cases of hypersensitivity have been reported with the use of sucralfate oral suspension, including anaphylactic reactions, dyspnea, lip swelling, edema of the mouth, pharyngeal edema, pruritus, rash, swelling of the face and urticaria. Cases of bronchospasm, laryngeal edema and respiratory tract edema have been reported with an unknown oral formulation of sucralfate. Cases of hyperglycemia have been reported with sucralfate. Bezoars have been reported in patients treated with sucralfate. The majority of patients had underlying medical conditions that may predispose to bezoar formation ( such as delayed gastric emptying ) or were receiving concomitant enteral tube feedings."
