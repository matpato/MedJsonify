    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Hydroquinone is a skin-bleaching agent, which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this product. Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin and check within 24 hours. Some users of this product may experience a mild skin irritation. If skin irritation becomes severe, stop use and consult a doctor. Close patient supervision is recommended. WARNINGS: Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth and lips. In case of accidental contact, patient should rinse thoroughly with water and contact a physician. Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of hydroquinone therapy because even minimal sunlight exposure sustains melanocytic activity. Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.PRECAUTIONS (also see WARNINGS ): Treatment should be limited to relatively small areas of the body at one time since some patients experience a transient skin reddening and a mild burning sensation, which does not preclude treatment. PREGNANCY CATEGORY C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with topical hydroquinone. It is also not known whether hydroquinone can cause fetal harm when used topically on a pregnant woman or affect reproductive capacity. It is not known to what degree, if any, topical hydroquinone is absorbed systemically. Topical hydroquinone should be used on pregnant women only when clearly indicated. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether topical hydroquinone is absorbed or excreted in human milk. Caution is advised when topical hydroquinone is used by a nursing mother. PEDIATRIC USAGE Safety and effectiveness in children below the age of 12 years have not been established.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS No systemic adverse reactions have been reported. Occasional hypersensitivity (localized contact dermatitis) may occur, in which case the product should be discontinued and the physician notified immediately.
