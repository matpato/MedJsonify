When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to vancomycin. Hypersensitivity to vancomycin ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion Reactions : Hypotension, including shock and cardiac arrest, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, muscular, chest pain and “vancomycin infusion reaction” which manifests as pruritus and erythema that involves the face, neck and upper torso may occur with rapid intravenous administration. To reduce the risk of infusion reactions, administer vancomycin hydrochloride for injection in a diluted solution over a period of 60 minutes or greater and also prior to intravenous anesthetic agents. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Nephrotoxicity : Systemic vancomycin exposure may result in acute kidney injury ( AKI ) including acute renal failure, mainly due to interstitial nephritis or less commonly acute tubular necrosis. Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function. ( 5.2 ) Ototoxicity : Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ototoxicity during therapy. Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function. Assessment of auditory function may be appropriate in some instances. ( 5.3 ) Severe Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue vancomycin hydrochloride for injection at the first appearance of skin rashes, mucosal lesions, or blisters ( 5.4 ) . Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea : Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.5 ) Neutropenia : Periodically monitor leukocyte count. ( 5.7 ) Phlebitis: To reduce the risk of local irritation and phlebitis administer vancomycin hydrochloride for injection by a secure intravenous route of administration. ( 5.8 ) Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria: Prescribing vancomycin hydrochloride for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Infusion Reactions Hypotension, including shock and cardiac arrest, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, muscular and chest pain may occur with rapid vancomycin hydrochloride for injection administration. The reactions may be more severe in younger patients, particularly children, and in patients receiving concomitant muscle relaxant anesthetics. Rapid intravenous administration of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection may also be associated with “vancomycin infusion reaction” , which manifests as pruritus and erythema that involves the face, neck and upper torso. Infusion-related adverse reactions are related to both the concentration and the rate of administration of vancomycin. Infusion-related adverse reactions may occur, however, at any rate or concentration. Administer vancomycin hydrochloride for injection in a diluted solution over a period of 60 minutes or greater to reduce the risk of infusion-related adverse reactions. In selected patients in need of fluid restriction, a concentration up to 10 mg/mL may be used; use of such higher concentrations may increase the risk of infusion-related adverse reactions. Administer prior to intravenous anesthetic agents when feasible. Stop the infusion if a reaction occurs. 5.2 Nephrotoxicity Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection can result in acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , including acute renal failure, mainly due to interstitial nephritis or less commonly acute tubular necrosis. AKI is manifested by increasing blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and serum creatinine ( Cr ) . The risk of AKI increases with higher vancomycin serum levels, prolonged exposure, concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs, concomitant administration of piperacillin-tazobactam [see , volume depletion, pre-existing renal impairment and in critically ill patients and patients with co-morbid conditions that predispose to renal impairment. Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function in all patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride for injection. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with comorbidities that predispose to impairment in renal function or are concomitantly receiving other nephrotoxic drugs, in critically ill patients, in patients with changing renal function, and in patients requiring higher therapeutic vancomycin levels. If acute kidney injury occurs, discontinue vancomycin hydrochloride for injection or reduce the dose. 5.3 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride for injection. It may be transient or permanent. Ototoxicity manifests as tinnitus, hearing loss, dizziness or vertigo. The risk is higher in older patients, patients who are receiving higher doses, who have an underlying hearing loss, who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent, such as an aminoglycoside or who have underlying renal impairment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ototoxicity during therapy. Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function in all patients receiving parenteral vancomycin. Discontinue vancomycin hydrochloride for injection if ototoxicity occurs. Dosage of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection must be adjusted for patients with renal impairment [see . Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity. Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] 5.4 Severe Dermatologic Reactions Severe dermatologic reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) , and linear IgA bullous dermatosis ( LABD ) have been reported in association with the use of vancomycin. Cutaneous signs or symptoms reported include skin rashes, mucosal lesions, and blisters. Discontinue vancomycin hydrochloride for injection at the first appearance of signs and symptoms of TEN, SJS, DRESS, AGEP, or LABD. 5.5 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including vancomycin hydrochloride for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients being treated for active C. difficile -induced pseudomembranous colitis after multiple oral doses of vancomycin. Prolonged use of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. In rare instances, there have been reports of pseudomembranous colitis due to C. difficile developing in patients who received intravenous vancomycin hydrochloride for injection. 5.6 Hemorrhagic Occlusive Retinal Vasculitis ( HORV ) Hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis, including permanent loss of vision, occurred in patients receiving intracameral or intravitreal administration of vancomycin during or after cataract surgery. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administered by the intracameral or the intravitreal route have not been established by adequate and well-controlled trials. Vancomycin is not indicated for the prophylaxis of endophthalmitis. 5.7 Neutropenia Reversible neutropenia has been reported in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride for injection [see . Patients who will undergo prolonged therapy with vancomycin hydrochloride for injection or those who are receiving concomitant drugs which may cause neutropenia should have periodic monitoring of the leukocyte count. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.8 Phlebitis and Other Administration Site Reactions Inflammation at the site of injection of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection has been reported. Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is irritating to tissue and must be given by a secure intravenous route of administration to reduce the risk of local irritation and phlebitis. Administration of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection by intramuscular ( IM ) , intraperitoneal, intrathecal ( intralumbar or intraventricular ) , or intravitreal routes has not been approved and is not recommended. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administered by the intrathecal ( intralumbar or intraventricular ) route or by the intraperitoneal route have not been established by adequate and well controlled trials. Pain, tenderness, and necrosis occur with IM injection of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection or with inadvertent extravasation. Thrombophlebitis may occur, the frequency and severity of which can be minimized by administering the drug slowly as a dilute solution ( 2.5 to 5 g/L ) and by rotation of venous access sites. Intraperitoneal administration during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) can result in chemical peritonitis. Manifestations range from cloudy dialysate alone to a cloudy dialysate accompanied by variable degrees of abdominal pain and fever. This syndrome appears to be resolve after discontinuation of intraperitoneal vancomycin. 5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing vancomycin hydrochloride for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",
