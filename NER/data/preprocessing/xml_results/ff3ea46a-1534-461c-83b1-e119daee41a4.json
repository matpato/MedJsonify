    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is indicated as a source of water and electrolytes. 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is also indicated for use as a priming solution in hemodialysis procedures.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS None known.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions, including hypotension, pyrexia, tremor, chills, urticaria, rash, and pruritus have been reported with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and may occur with 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction develop, such as tachycardia, chest pain, dyspnea and flushing. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated. Electrolyte Imbalances Fluid Overload Depending on the volume and rate of infusion, and the patient’s underlying clinical condition, the intravenous administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fluid disturbances such as overhydration/hypervolemia and congested states, including pulmonary congestion and edema. Avoid 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading.  If use cannot be avoided, monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid base balance, as needed and especially during prolonged use. Hyponatremia Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may cause hyponatremia. Hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy, and vomiting. Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. The risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia is increased in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopressin release (including SIADH) treated with high volume of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The risk for hyponatremia is increased in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia, and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as diuretics, certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications).  See DRUG INTERACTIONS . Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia such as hyponatremic encephalopathy, include pediatric patients, women (in particular pre-menopausal women), patients with hypoxemia, and patients with underlying central nervous system disease.  Avoid Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia.  If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations. Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications. Brain adaptations reducing risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury when chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected, which is known as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). To avoid complications, monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations, fluid status, acid-base balance, and signs of neurologic complications. Hypernatremia Hypernatremia may occur with Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  Conditions that may increase the risk of hypernatremia, fluid overload and edema (central and peripheral), include patients with: primary hyperaldosteronism; secondary hyperaldosteronism associated with, for example, hypertension, congestive heart failure, liver disease (including cirrhosis), renal disease (including renal artery stenosis, nephrosclerosis); and pre-eclampsia. Certain medications, such as corticosteroids or corticotropin, may also increase risk of sodium and fluid retention, see . DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with, or at risk for, hypernatremia. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations. Rapid correction of hypernatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications. Excessively rapid correction of hypernatremia is also associated with a risk for serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) with risk of seizures and cerebral edema.PRECAUTIONS Patients with Severe Renal Impairment Administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with or at risk of severe renal impairment, may result in hypernatremia and/or fluid overload (see ). Avoid Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients with severe renal impairment or conditions that may cause sodium and/or potassium retention, fluid overload, or edema. If use cannot be avoided, monitor patients with severe renal impairment for development of these adverse reactions. WARNINGS Drug Interactions Other Products that Affect Fluid and/or Electrolyte Balance Administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to patients treated concomitantly with drugs associated with sodium and fluid retention may increase the risk of hypernatremia and volume overload.  Avoid use of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients receiving such products, such as corticosteroids or corticotropin.  If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum electrolytes, fluid balance and acid-base balance. Lithium Renal sodium and lithium clearance may be decreased during administration of 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  Monitor serum lithium concentrations during concomitant use. Renal sodium and lithium clearance may be increased during administration of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Monitor serum lithium concentrations during concomitant use. Other Drugs that Increase the Risk of Hyponatremia Administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients treated concomitantly with medications associated with hyponatremia may increase the risk of developing hyponatremia. Avoid use of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in patients receiving products, such as diuretics, and certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications. Drugs that increase the vasopressin effect reduce renal electrolyte free water excretion and may also increase the risk of hyponatremia following treatment with intravenous fluids. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations. Pregnancy There are no adequate and well controlled studies with Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in pregnant women and animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this drug.  Therefore, it is not known whether Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is present in human milk.  Because many drugs are present in human milk, caution should be exercised when Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The use of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in pediatric patients is based on clinical practice. (See ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Closely monitor plasma electrolyte concentrations in pediatric patients who may have impaired ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes.  In very low birth weight infants, excessive or rapid administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may result in increased serum osmolality and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Children (including neonates and older children) are at increased risk of developing hyponatremia as well as for developing hyponatremic encephalopathy. Geriatric Use Geriatric patients are at increased risk of developing electrolyte imbalances. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients.",
