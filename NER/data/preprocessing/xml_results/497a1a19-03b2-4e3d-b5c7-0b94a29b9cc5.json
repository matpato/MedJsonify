( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Westminster Pharmaceuticals, LLC. at 1-844-221-7294 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Famotidine was studied in 7 U.S. and international placebo- and active-controlled trials in approximately 2,500 patients [ see ]. A total of 1,442 patients were treated with famotidine, including 302 treated with 40 mg twice daily, 456 treated with 20 mg twice daily, 461 treated with 40 mg once daily, and 396 treated with 20 mg once daily. The population was 17 to 91 years old, fairly well distributed between gender and race; however, the predominant race treated was Caucasian. Clinical Studies (14) The following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of famotidine-treated patients: headache, dizziness and constipation. The following other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials: Body as a Whole: fever, asthenia, fatigue Cardiovascular: palpitations Gastrointestinal: elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth Hematologic: thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: orbital edema, rash, conjunctival injection, bronchospasm Musculoskeletal: musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia Nervous System/Psychiatric: seizure, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, decreased libido, insomnia, somnolence Skin: pruritus, dry skin, flushing Special Senses: tinnitus, taste disorder Other: impotence 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of famotidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, AV block, prolonged QT interval Gastrointestinal: cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis Hematologic: agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, facial edema, urticaria Musculoskeletal: rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramps Nervous System/Psychiatric: confusion, agitation, paresthesia Respiratory: interstitial pneumonia Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome"
