    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Doxil liposomal infusion is an anthracycline topoisomerase inhibitor indicated for: • Ovarian cancer: After failure of platinum-based chemotherapy ( 1.1 ) • AIDS-related Kaposi’s Sarcoma: After failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy ( 1.2 ) • Multiple Myeloma: In combination with bortezomib in patients who have not previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Ovarian Cancer DOXIL liposomal infusion is indicated for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer whose disease has progressed or recurred after platinum-based chemotherapy. 1.2 AIDS-Related Kaposi’s Sarcoma DOXIL liposomal infusion is indicated for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma in patients after failure of prior systemic chemotherapy or intolerance to such therapy. 1.3 Multiple Myeloma DOXIL liposomal infusion, in combination with bortezomib, is indicated for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have not previously received bortezomib and have received at least one prior therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DOXIL liposomal infusion is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, to doxorubicin hydrochloride [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. • Hypersensitivity reactions to doxorubicin hydrochloride or the components of DOXIL liposomal infusion ( 4 , 5.2 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hand-Foot Syndrome may occur. Dose modification or discontinuation may be required ( 5.3 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus. Use effective contraception ( 5.5 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin hydrochloride can cause myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure. The risk of cardiomyopathy with doxorubicin hydrochloride is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure. Include prior use of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of cumulative dose. The risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses in patients with prior mediastinal irradiation. In a clinical study in 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with DOXIL liposomal infusion, the risk of cardiomyopathy was 11% when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450 mg/m 2 to 550 mg/m 2 . Cardiomyopathy was defined as >20% decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline where LVEF remained in the normal range or a >10% decrease in LVEF from baseline where LVEF was less than the institutional lower limit of normal. Two percent of patients developed signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure without documented evidence of cardiomyopathy. Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g. MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of DOXIL liposomal infusion, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiomyopathy. Administer DOXIL liposomal infusion to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Serious, life-threatening, and fatal infusion-related reactions characterized by one or more of the following symptoms can occur with DOXIL liposomal infusion: flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, chest pain, back pain, tightness in the chest and throat, fever, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, cyanosis, syncope, bronchospasm, asthma, apnea, and hypotension.  Of 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with DOXIL liposomal infusion in Trial 4, 7% of patients experienced acute infusion-related reactions resulting in dose interruption. All occurred during cycle 1 and none during subsequent cycles. Across multiple studies of DOXIL liposomal infusion monotherapy including this and other studies enrolling 760 patients with various solid tumors, 11% of patients had infusion-related reactions. The majority of infusion-related events occurred during the first infusion. Ensure that medications to treat infusion-related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment are available for immediate use prior to initiation of DOXIL liposomal infusion. Initiate DOXIL liposomal infusions at a rate of 1 mg/min and increase rate as tolerated [see . Withhold DOXIL liposomal infusion for Grade 1, 2, or 3 infusion-related reactions and resume at a reduced infusion rate. Discontinue DOXIL liposomal infusion for serious or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] 5.3 Hand-Foot Syndrome (HFS) In Trial 4, the incidence of HFS was 51% of patients in the DOXIL liposomal infusion arm and 0.9% of patients in the topotecan arm, including 24% Grade 3 or 4 cases of HFS in DOXIL liposomal infusion-treated patients and no Grade 3 or 4 cases in topotecan-treated patients. HFS or other skin toxicity required discontinuation of DOXIL liposomal infusion in 4.2% of patients. HFS was generally observed after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment but may occur earlier. Delay DOXIL liposomal infusion for the first episode of Grade 2 or greater HFS [see . Discontinue DOXIL liposomal infusion if HFS is severe and debilitating. Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] 5.4 Secondary Oral Neoplasms Secondary oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinoma, have been reported from post-marketing experience in patients with long-term (more than one year) exposure to DOXIL liposomal infusion. These malignancies were diagnosed both during treatment with DOXIL liposomal infusion and up to 6 years after the last dose. Examine patients at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or with any oral discomfort that may be indicative of secondary oral cancer. The altered pharmacokinetics and preferential tissue distribution of liposomal doxorubicin that contributes to enhanced skin toxicity and mucositis compared to free doxorubicin may play a role in the development of oral secondary malignancies with long-term use. 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, DOXIL liposomal infusion can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman; avoid the use of DOXIL liposomal infusion during the 1 st trimester. Available human data do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects and miscarriage related to the use of doxorubicin hydrochloride during the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. At doses approximately 0.12 times the recommended clinical dose, DOXIL liposomal infusion was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with DOXIL liposomal infusion [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]",

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact Baxter Healthcare at 1-866-888-2472  or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates on other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety data reflect exposure to DOXIL liposomal infusion in 1310 patients including: 239 patients with ovarian cancer, 753 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, and 318 patients with multiple myeloma. The most common adverse reactions (>20%) observed with DOXIL liposomal infusion are asthenia, fatigue, fever, nausea, stomatitis, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, hand-foot syndrome, rash and neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. The following tables present adverse reactions from clinical trials of single-agent DOXIL liposomal infusion in ovarian cancer and AIDS-Related Kaposi’s sarcoma. Patients With Ovarian Cancer The safety data described below are from Trial 4, which included 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with DOXIL liposomal infusion 50 mg/m 2 once every 4 weeks for a minimum of four courses in a randomized, multicenter, open-label study. In this trial, patients received DOXIL liposomal infusion for a median number of 3.2 months (range 1 day to 25.8 months). The median age of the patients is 60 years (range 27 to 87), with 91% Caucasian, 6% Black, and 3% Hispanic or Other. Table 3 presents the hematologic adverse reactions from Trial 4.

Demographics of the population were: median age 38.7 years (range 24–70); 99% male; 88% Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, 4% Black, and 2% Asian/other/unknown. The majority of patients were treated with 20 mg/m 2 of DOXIL liposomal infusion every 2 to 3 weeks with a median exposure of 4.2 months (range 1 day to 26.6 months). The median cumulative dose was 120 mg/m 2 (range 3.3 to 798.6 mg/m 2 ); 3% received cumulative doses of greater than 450 mg/m 2 . Disease characteristics were: 61% poor risk for KS tumor burden, 91% poor risk for immune system, and 47% poor risk for systemic illness; 36% were poor risk for all three categories; median CD4 count 21 cells/mm 3 (51% less than 50 cells/mm 3 ); mean absolute neutrophil count at study entry approximately 3,000 cells/mm 3 . Of the 693 patients with concomitant medication information, 59% were on one or more antiretroviral medications [35% zidovudine (AZT), 21% didanosine (ddI), 16% zalcitabine (ddC), and 10% stavudine (D4T)]; 85% received PCP prophylaxis (54% sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim); 85% received antifungal medications (76% fluconazole); 72% received antivirals (56% acyclovir, 29% ganciclovir, and 16% foscarnet) and 48% patients received colony-stimulating factors (sargramostim/filgrastim) during their course of treatment. Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5% of patients with AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma and included myelosuppression, cardiac adverse reactions, infusion-related reactions, toxoplasmosis, HFS, pneumonia, cough/dyspnea, fatigue, optic neuritis, progression of a non-KS tumor, allergy to penicillin, and unspecified reasons. Table 5 and Table 6 summarize adverse reactions reported in patients treated with DOXIL liposomal infusion for AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma in a pooled analysis of the four trials.

Patients With Multiple Myeloma The safety data described are from 318 patients treated with DOXIL liposomal infusion (30 mg/m 2 ) administered on day 4 following bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 2 i.v. bolus on days 1, 4, 8 and 11) every 3 weeks, in a randomized, open-label, multicenter study (Trial 6). In this trial, patients in the DOXIL liposomal infusion + bortezomib combination group were treated for a median number of 4.5 months (range 21 days to 13.5 months). The population was 28 to 85 years of age (median age 61), 58% male, 90% Caucasian, 6% Black, and 4% Asian and Other. Table 7 lists adverse reactions reported in 10% or more of patients treated with DOXIL liposomal infusion in combination with bortezomib for multiple myeloma.
