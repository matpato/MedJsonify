Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to and during treatment. If QTc interval prolongation occurs, interrupt, reduce, or permanently discontinue REVUFORJ. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1  Differentiation Syndrome REVUFORJ can cause fatal or life-threatening differentiation syndrome (DS). Symptoms of differentiation syndrome, including those seen in patients treated with REVUFORJ, include fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, peripheral edema, pleuropericardial effusion, acute renal failure, and/or hypotension. In clinical trials, DS occurred in 39 (29%) of 135 patients treated with REVUFORJ at the recommended dosage for relapsed or refractory acute leukemia with a KMT2A translocation, including 32% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 25% of patients with mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and 14% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DS was Grade 3 or 4 in 13% and fatal in one patient. The median time to onset was 10 days (range 3-41 days). Some patients experienced more than 1 DS event. Treatment interruption was required for 7% of patients, and treatment was withdrawn for 1% [ see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) Reduce the white blood cell count (WBC) to less than 25 Gi/L prior to starting REVUFORJ. If DS is suspected, immediately initiate treatment with systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours in adults or dexamethasone 0.25 mg/kg/dose intravenously every 12 hours in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg) for a minimum of 3 days and until resolution of signs and symptoms. Institute supportive measures and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement. Interrupt REVUFORJ if severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of systemic corticosteroids, or earlier if life-threatening symptoms occur such as pulmonary symptoms requiring ventilator support. Restart steroids promptly if DS recurs after tapering corticosteroids [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 5.2  QTc Interval Prolongation REVUFORJ can cause QT (QTc) interval prolongation [see ]. In the clinical trials, QTc interval prolongation was reported as an adverse reaction in 39 (29%) of 135 patients treated with REVUFORJ at the recommended dosage for relapsed or refractory acute leukemia with a KMT2A translocation; QTc interval prolongation was Grade 3 in 12%. The heart-rate corrected QT interval (using Fridericia’s method) (QTcF) was greater than 500 msec in 8%, and the increase from baseline QTcF was greater than 60 msec in 18%. REVUFORJ dose reduction was required for 5% due to QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. QTc prolongation occurred in 16% of the 31 patients less than 17 years old, 33% of the 88 patients 17 years to less than 65 years old, and in 50% of the 16 patients 65 years or older. Adverse Reactions (6.1 ) Correct electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, prior to treatment with REVUFORJ. Perform an ECG prior to initiation of treatment with REVUFORJ, and do not initiate REVUFORJ in patients with QTcF > 450 msec. Perform an ECG at least once a week for the first 4 weeks on treatment, and at least monthly thereafter [see ]. In patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval, more frequent ECG monitoring may be necessary. Concomitant use of REVUFORJ with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval may increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) Interrupt REVUFORJ if QTcF increases to greater than 480 msec and less than 500 msec, and restart REVUFORJ at the same dose twice daily after the QTcF interval returns to less than or equal to 480 msec. Interrupt REVUFORJ if QTcF increases to greater than 500 msec or by > 60 msec from baseline, and restart REVUFORJ twice daily at the lower dose level after the QTcF interval returns to less than or equal to 480 msec. Permanently discontinue REVUFORJ in patients with ventricular arrhythmias and in those who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs or symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia [see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.3) 5.3  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, REVUFORJ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of revumenib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including embryo-fetal mortality, malformations, and altered fetal growth at maternal exposures approximately 0.5 times the human exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with REVUFORJ and for 4 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",

Relapsed or Refractory Acute Leukemia with KMT2A translocation The safety of REVUFORJ reflects exposure in 135 patients (104 adult and 31 pediatric patients) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute leukemia with KMT2A translocation treated with REVUFORJ at a dose approximately equivalent to 160 mg in adults orally twice daily with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The median duration of exposure to REVUFORJ was 2.3 months (range < 1 to 23 months), and 3% of patients were exposed for more than 6 months. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4 (3%) patients who received REVUFORJ, including 2 with differentiation syndrome, 1 with hemorrhage, and 1 with sudden death. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 99 (73%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥ 5%) were infection (24%), febrile neutropenia (19%), bacterial infection (17%), differentiation syndrome (12%), hemorrhage (9%), and thrombosis (5%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 42% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) leading to dose interruption were electrocardiogram QT prolonged, febrile neutropenia, differentiation syndrome, infection, hypokalemia, and nausea. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 10% of patients who received REVUFORJ. Adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction (> 1%) included electrocardiogram QT prolonged. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 12% of patients. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation (> 1%) included infection and respiratory failure. The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions were hemorrhage, nausea, phosphate increased, musculoskeletal pain, infection, aspartate aminotransferase increased, febrile neutropenia, alanine aminotransferase increased, parathyroid hormone intact increased, bacterial infection, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, phosphate decreased, triglycerides increased, potassium decreased, decreased appetite, constipation, edema, viral infection, fatigue, and alkaline phosphatase increased.
