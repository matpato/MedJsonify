( 1.1 ). The treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in adults and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older. The use of DEXTENZA is not recommended for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in pediatric patients who require sedation for the insertion procedure. ( 1.2 ). 1.1 Ocular Inflammation and Pain Following Ophthalmic Surgery DEXTENZA is indicated for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery ( 1.1 ). 1.2 Itching Associated with Allergic Conjunctivitis DEXTENZA is indicated for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in adults and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older ( 1.2 ).

Active ocular infections ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intraocular Pressure Increase : Monitor intraocular pressure ( 5.1 ). Bacterial Infections : Steroids may mask signs of infections and enhance existing infections ( 5.2 ). Viral Infections : Ocular steroids may prolong the course and exacerbate the severity of ocular viral infections ( 5.3 ). Fungal Infections : Consider fungal invasion in any persistent corneal ulceration ( 5.4 ). Delayed Healing : Ocular steroids may slow the rate of ocular healing. ( 5.5 ). 5.1 Intraocular Pressure Increase Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Intraocular pressure should be monitored during the course of the treatment. 5.2 Bacterial Infection Corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard for secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection and enhance existing infection [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.3 Viral Infections Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex) [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.4 Fungal Infections Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal culture should be taken when appropriate [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.5 Delayed Healing The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. 5.6  Other Potential Corticosteroid Complications The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order of DEXTENZA should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Intraocular Pressure Increase [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Bacterial Infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Viral Infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Fungal Infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Delayed Healing [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most commonly reported adverse reactions were anterior chamber inflammation and elevations in intraocular pressure.  These occurred in approximately 6-10% of patients ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ocular Therapeutix at 1-800-DEXTENZA (339-8369) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation; delayed wound healing; secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5 )] 6.2 Ocular Inflammation and Pain Following Ophthalmic Surgery DEXTENZA safety was studied in four randomized, vehicle-controlled studies (n = 567). The mean age of the population was 68 years (range 35 to 87 years), 59% were female, and 83% were white. Forty-seven percent had brown iris color and 30% had blue iris color. The most common ocular adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with DEXTENZA were: anterior chamber inflammation including iritis and iridocyclitis (10%); intraocular pressure increased (6%); visual acuity reduced (2%); cystoid macular edema (1%); corneal edema (1%); eye pain (1%) and conjunctival hyperemia (1%). The most common non-ocular adverse reaction that occurred in patients treated with DEXTENZA was headache (1%). 6.3 Itching  Associated with Allergic Conjunctivitis DEXTENZA safety was studied in four randomized, vehicle-controlled studies (n= 154).  The mean age of the population was 41 years (range 19 to 69 years), 55 % were female and 61 % were white.  Fifty seven percent had brown iris color and 20% had blue iris color. The most common ocular adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with DEXTENZA were: intraocular pressure increased (3%), lacrimation increased (1%), eye discharge (1%), and visual acuity reduced (1%). The most common non-ocular adverse reaction that occurred in patients treated with DEXTENZA was headache (1%)."
