  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE PYLARIFY is indicated for positron emission tomography ( PET ) of prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer: with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy. with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level. PYLARIFY is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography ( PET ) of prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) positive lesions in men with prostate cancer: with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy. with suspected recurrence based on elevated serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level.

  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Image Misinterpretation : PYLARIFY uptake can be seen in a variety of tumor types as well as in non-malignant processes and normal tissues. Image interpretation errors can occur with PYLARIFY imaging. ( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions, particularly patients with a history of allergy to other drugs and foods. ( 5.2 ) Radiation Risk : Ensure safe drug handling to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Risk of Image Misinterpretation Imaging interpretation errors can occur with PYLARIFY imaging. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence of prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels [ see ] . The performance of PYLARIFY for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by risk factors such as Gleason score and tumor stage [ Clinical Studies ( 14 ) see ] . PYLARIFY uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes and in normal tissues. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended. Clinical Studies ( 14 ) 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions, particularly patients with a history of allergy to other drugs and foods. Reactions may not be immediate. Always have trained staff and resuscitation equipment available. 5.3 Radiation Risks Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, including PYLARIFY, expose patients to radiation [see . Radiation exposure is associated with a dose-dependent increased risk of cancer. Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common reported adverse reactions are headache, dysgeusia, and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-362-2668 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of PYLARIFY was evaluated in 593 patients, each receiving one dose of PYLARIFY. The average injected activity was 340 ± 26 MBq ( 9.2 ± 0.7 mCi ) . The adverse reactions reported in >0.5% of patients within the studies are shown in Table 2. In addition, a hypersensitivity reaction was reported in one patient ( 0.2% ) with a history of allergic reaction. Table 2.
