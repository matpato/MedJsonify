  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE VYONDYS 53 is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on an increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle observed in patients treated with VYONDYS 53 [see Clinical Studies ( . Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. 14 ) ] VYONDYS 53 is an antisense oligonucleotide indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on an increase in dystrophin production in skeletal muscle observed in patients treated with VYONDYS 53. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. ( 1 )",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS VYONDYS 53 is contraindicated in patients with a serious hypersensitivity reaction to golodirsen or to any of the inactive ingredients in VYONDYS 53. Anaphylaxis has occurred in patients receiving VYONDYS 53 [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 ) ] VYONDYS 53 is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to golodirsen or to any of the inactive ingredients in VYONDYS 53. ( 4 , 5.1 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, urticaria, dermatitis, and skin exfoliation have occurred in patients who were treated with VYONDYS 53. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate medical treatment and consider slowing the infusion, interrupting or discontinuing the VYONDYS 53 therapy. ( 2.3 , 4 , 5.1 ) Kidney Toxicity: Based on animal data, may cause kidney toxicity. Kidney function should be monitored; creatinine may not be a reliable measure of renal function in DMD patients. ( 5.2 , 13.2 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, urticaria, dermatitis, and skin exfoliation have occurred in VYONDYS 53-treated patients, some requiring treatment. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate medical treatment and consider slowing the infusion, interrupting, or discontinuing the VYONDYS 53 therapy and monitor until the condition resolves [see Dosage and Administration ( VYONDYS 53 is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to golodirsen or to any of the inactive ingredients in VYONDYS 53 2.4 ) ] . [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.2 Kidney Toxicity Kidney toxicity was observed in animals who received golodirsen [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Although kidney toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies with VYONDYS 53, the clinical experience with VYONDYS 53 is limited, and kidney toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Kidney function should be monitored in patients taking VYONDYS 53. Because of the effect of reduced skeletal muscle mass on creatinine measurements, creatinine may not be a reliable measure of kidney function in DMD patients. Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting VYONDYS 53. Consider also measuring glomerular filtration rate using an exogenous filtration marker before starting VYONDYS 53. During treatment, monitor urine dipstick every month, and serum cystatin C and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio every three months. Only urine expected to be free of excreted VYONDYS 53 should be used for monitoring of urine protein. Urine obtained on the day of VYONDYS 53 infusion prior to the infusion, or urine obtained at least 48 hours after the most recent infusion, may be used. Alternatively, use a laboratory test that does not use the reagent pyrogallol red, as this reagent has the potential to cross react with any VYONDYS 53 that is excreted in the urine and thus lead to a false positive result for urine protein. 8.4 ) ] If a persistent increase in serum cystatin C or proteinuria is detected, refer to a pediatric nephrologist for further evaluation.",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( incidence â‰¥20% and higher than placebo ) were headache, pyrexia, fall, abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, cough, vomiting, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-888-SAREPTA ( 1-888-727-3782 ) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the VYONDYS 53 clinical development program, 58 patients received at least one intravenous dose of VYONDYS 53, ranging between 4 mg/kg ( 0.13 times the recommended dosage ) and 30 mg/kg ( the recommended dosage ) . All patients were male and had genetically confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Age at study entry was 6 to 13 years. Most ( 86% ) patients were Caucasian. VYONDYS 53 was studied in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In Study 1 Part 1, patients were randomized to receive once-weekly intravenous infusions of VYONDYS 53 ( n=8 ) in four increasing dose levels from 4 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg or placebo ( n=4 ) , for at least 2 weeks at each level. All patients who participated in Study 1 Part 1 ( n=12 ) were continued into Study 1 Part 2, an open-label extension, during which they received VYONDYS 53 at a dose of 30 mg/kg IV once weekly [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 ) ] In Study 2, patients received VYONDYS 53 ( n=33 ) 30 mg/kg or placebo ( n=17 ) IV once weekly for up to 96 weeks, after which all patients received VYONDYS 53 at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Adverse reactions observed in at least 20% of treated patients in the placebo-controlled sections of Studies 1 and 2 are shown in Table 1 . Table 1: Adverse Reactions That Occurred in At Least 20% of VYONDYS 53-Treated Patients and at a Rate Greater than Placebo in Studies 1 and 2 Adverse Reaction VYONDYS 53 ( N = 41 ) % Placebo ( N = 21 ) % Headache 41 10 Pyrexia 41 14 Fall 29 19 Abdominal pain 27 10 Nasopharyngitis 27 14 Cough 27 19 Vomiting 27 19 Nausea 20 10 Other adverse reactions that occurred at a frequency greater than 5% of VYONDYS 53-treated patients and at a greater frequency than placebo were: administration site pain, back pain, pain, diarrhea, dizziness, ligament sprain, contusion, influenza, oropharyngeal pain, rhinitis, skin abrasion, ear infection, seasonal allergy, tachycardia, catheter site related reaction, constipation, and fracture. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients treated with VYONDYS 53 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of VYONDYS 53. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
