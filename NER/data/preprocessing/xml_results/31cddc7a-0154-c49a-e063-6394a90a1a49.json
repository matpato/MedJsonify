    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe, potentially life threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme. Immediately discontinue treatment if severe hypersensitivity, severe rash or rash with systemic symptoms or liver transaminase elevations develops and monitor clinical status, including liver transaminases closely. ( 5.1 ) Monitor for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution. ( 5.3 , 5.4 ) 5.1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, potentially life-threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported. In clinical trials, these include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme. Hypersensitivity reactions including Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. In Phase 3 clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 1.3% of subjects receiving Etravirine compared to 0.2% of placebo subjects. A total of 2.2% of HIV-1-infected subjects receiving Etravirine discontinued from Phase 3 trials due to rash [see . Rash occurred most commonly during the first 6 weeks of therapy. The incidence of rash was higher in females Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Stevens-Johnson syndrome was reported in 1.1% (2/177) of pediatric patients less than 18 years of age receiving Etravirine in combination with other HIV-1 antiretroviral agents in an observational study. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Discontinue Etravirine immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver transaminases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Delay in stopping Etravirine treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. 5.2 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of Etravirine and other drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to [see : Drug Interactions (7.3) ] Loss of therapeutic effect of concomitant drug or Etravirine and possible development of resistance. Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of Etravirine or other concomitant drugs. See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during Etravirine therapy and review concomitant medications during Etravirine therapy. 5.3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Etravirine. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.4 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \"cushingoid appearance\" have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established.",

Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Immune reconstitution syndrome [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse drug reactions of moderate to severe intensity (at least 2%) which occurred at a higher rate than placebo in adults are rash and peripheral neuropathy. ( 6.1 ) The most common adverse drug reactions in at least 2% of pediatric patients are rash and diarrhea.

Clinical Trials Experience in Adults The safety assessment is based on all data from 1203 subjects in the Phase 3 placebo-controlled trials, TMC125-C206 and TMC125-C216, conducted in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adult subjects, 599 of whom received Etravirine (200 mg twice daily). In these pooled trials, the median exposure for subjects in the Etravirine arm and placebo arm was 52.3 and 51.0 weeks, respectively. Discontinuations due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were 5.2% in the Etravirine arm and 2.6% in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported ADR at least Grade 2 in severity was rash (10.0%). Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug hypersensitivity reaction and erythema multiforme were reported in less than 0.1% of subjects during clinical development with Etravirine [see . A total of 2.2% of HIV-1-infected subjects in Phase 3 trials receiving Etravirine discontinued due to rash. In general, in clinical trials, rash was mild to moderate, occurred primarily in the second week of therapy, and was infrequent after Week 4. Rash generally resolved within 1 to 2 weeks on continued therapy. The incidence of rash was higher in women compared to men in the Etravirine arm in the Phase 3 trials (rash ≥ Grade 2 was reported in 9/60 [15.0%] women versus 51/539 [9.5%] men; discontinuations due to rash were reported in 3/60 [5.0%] women versus 10/539 [1.9%] men) Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] [see . Patients with a history of NNRTI-related rash did not appear to be at increased risk for the development of Etravirine-related rash compared to patients without a history of NNRTI-related rash. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Common Adverse Reactions Clinical ADRs of moderate intensity or greater (greater than or equal to Grade 2) and reported in at least 2% of subjects treated with Etravirine and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo (excess of 1%) are presented in Table 2.

AST and ALT abnormalities occurred more frequently in hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infected subjects for both treatment groups. Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening from baseline of AST, ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 27.8%, 25.0% and 7.1% respectively, of Etravirine-treated co-infected subjects as compared to 6.7%, 7.5% and 1.8% of non-co-infected Etravirine-treated subjects. In general, adverse events reported by Etravirine-treated subjects with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection were similar to Etravirine-treated subjects without hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus co-infection. Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects (2 Years to Less Than 18 years of age) The safety assessment in pediatric subjects is based on two single-arm trials. TMC125-C213 is a Phase 2 trial in which 101 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age received Etravirine in combination with other antiretroviral agents (Week 24 analysis). TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090 is a Phase 1/2 trial in which 20 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected pediatric subjects 2 years to less than 6 years of age received Etravirine in combination with other antiretroviral agents (Week 24 analysis) [see . Clinical Studies (14.2) ] In TMC125-C213, the frequency, type and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age were comparable to those observed in adult subjects, except for rash which was observed more frequently in pediatric subjects. The most common adverse drug reactions in at least 2% of pediatric subjects were rash and diarrhea. Rash was reported more frequently in female subjects than in male subjects (rash ≥ Grade 2 was reported in 13/64 [20.3%] females versus 2/37 [5.4%] males; discontinuations due to rash were reported in 4/64 [6.3%] females versus 0/37 [0%] males). Rash (greater than or equal to Grade 2) occurred in 15% of pediatric subjects from 6 years to less than 18 years of age. In the majority of cases, rash was mild to moderate, of macular/papular type, and occurred in the second week of therapy. Rash was self-limiting and generally resolved within 1 week on continued therapy. The safety profile for subjects who completed 48 weeks of treatment was similar to the safety profile for subjects who completed 24 weeks of treatment. In TMC125-C234/IMPAACT P1090, the frequency, type and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects 2 years to less than 6 years of age through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults. The most common adverse drug reactions (any grade) of pediatric subjects were rash (50% [10/20]) and diarrhea (25% [5/20]). In this age group, no subjects had Grade 3 or Grade 4 rash and no subjects discontinued prematurely due to rash. One subject discontinued etravirine due to asymptomatic lipase elevation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of Etravirine. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders : Severe hypersensitivity reactions including DRESS and cases of hepatic failure have been reported [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : rhabdomyolysis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Fatal cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]"
