When using these products, these patients should be on continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent testing for serum potassium concentration and acid-base balance.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Potassium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with: • hyperkalemia • known hypersensitivity to Potassium Chloride Injection",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Hyperkalemia THIS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED, READY-TO-USE POTASSIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION IS INTENDED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SERUM K + LEVELS AND FOR POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTATION IN FLUID RESTRICTED PATIENTS WHO CANNOT ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL VOLUMES OF FLUID ASSOCIATED WITH POTASSIUM SOLUTIONS OF LOWER CONCENTRATION. TO AVOID POTASSIUM INTOXICATION, DO NOT INFUSE THESE SOLUTIONS RAPIDLY. Potassium Chloride Injection should be administered with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia and/or associated with increased sensitivity to potassium, such as patients with: • severe renal impairment, • acute dehydration, • extensive tissue injury or burns, • certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure or AV block, • potassium-aggravated skeletal muscle channelopathies (e.g., hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, paramyotonia congenita, and potassium-aggravated myotonia/paramyotonia). Potassium Chloride Injection should be administered with caution to patients who are at risk of experiencing hyperosmolality, acidosis, or undergo correction of alkalosis (conditions associated with a shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space) and patients treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ). If used in high-risk patients, especially close monitoring and careful dose selection and adjustment is required. PATIENTS REQUIRING HIGHLY CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE KEPT ON CONTINUOUS CARDIAC MONITORING AND UNDERGO FREQUENT TESTING FOR SERUM POTASSIUM AND ACID-BASE BALANCE, ESPECIALLY IF THEY RECEIVE DIGITALIS. Administration of concentrated potassium solutions can cause cardiac conduction disorders (including complete heart block) and other cardiac arrhythmias at any time during infusion.  Continuous cardiac monitoring is performed to aid in the detection of cardiac arrhythmias due to a sudden increase in serum potassium concentration (e.g., when potassium infusion is started), or transient or sustained hyperkalemia (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and OVERDOSAGE ). Frequently, mild or moderate hyperkalemia is asymptomatic and may be manifested only by increased serum potassium concentrations and, possibly, characteristic EKG changes.  However, fatal arrhythmias can develop at any time during hyperkalemia. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels. Tissue Damage and Thrombophlebitis When infusing concentrated potassium solutions, including Potassium Chloride Injection, care must be taken to prevent paravenous administration or extravasation because such solutions may be associated with tissue damage, which may be severe and include vascular, nerve, and tendon damage, leading to surgical intervention, including amputation.  Secondary complications including pulmonary embolism from thrombophlebitis have been reported as a consequence of tissue damage from potassium chloride. Administer intravenously only with a calibrated infusion device at a slow, controlled rate. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .  Highest concentrations (400 mEq per L) should be exclusively administered via central intravenous route. Whenever possible, administration via a central route is recommended for all concentrations of Potassium Chloride Injection for thorough dilution by the blood stream and decreasing the risk of extravasation and to avoid pain and phlebitis associated with peripheral infusion.  Correct placement of the catheter should be verified before administration. Hyponatremia Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids.  Potassium Chloride Injection has an osmolarity of 200 to 799 mOsmol/L (see DESCRIPTION ). Potassium Chloride Injection may cause hyponatremia.  The risk for hyponatremia is increased, in pediatric patients, elderly patients, postoperative patients, those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia (such as certain diuretic, antiepileptic and psychotropic medications) (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache, nausea, seizures, lethargy and vomiting.  Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe, irreversible and life-threatening brain injury. Avoid Potassium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia.  If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations. High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure, and in patients with non-osmotic vasopression release (including SIADH), due to the risk of hospital-acquired hyponatremia. Fluid Overload Depending on the volume and rate of infusion, and the patient’s underlying clinical condition, the intravenous administration of Potassium Chloride Injection can cause electrolyte disturbances such as overhydration/hypervolemia and congested states including central (e.g., pulmonary edema) and peripheral edema. Avoid Potassium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading.  If use cannot be avoided, monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid base balance as needed and especially during prolonged use. Hyperchloremia In patients with or at risk of hyperchloremia, Potassium Chloride Injection may exacerbate or result in hyperchloremia.  Monitor plasma chloride levels and renal function in such patients.PRECAUTIONS General Do not connect flexible plastic containers in series in order to avoid air embolism due to possible residual air contained in the primary container. Laboratory Tests Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels. Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation.  Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the use of additional electrolyte supplements, or the use of electrolyte-free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added. Drug Interactions Other Products that Cause Hyperkalemia Administration of Potassium Chloride Injection in patients treated concurrently or recently with other products that can cause hyperkalemia or increase the risk of hyperkalemia (e.g., potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, cyclosporine and tacrolimus) increases the risk of severe and potentially fatal hyperkalemia, in particular in the presence of other risk factors for hyperkalemia (see WARNINGS ).  Avoid use of Potassium Chloride injection in patients receiving such products.  If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum potassium concentrations. Other Drugs that Increase the Risk of Hyponatremia Administration of Potassium Chloride Injection in patients treated concomitantly with drugs associated with hyponatremia may increase the risk of developing hyponatremia (see WARNINGS ). Avoid use of Potassium Chloride Injection in patients receiving drugs that may increase the risk of hyponatremia, such as diuretics and antiepileptics.  Drugs that increase the vasopressin effect reduce renal electrolyte free water excretion and may also increase the risk of hyponatremia following treatment with intravenous fluids. If use cannot be avoided, monitor serum sodium concentrations. Pregnancy There are no adequate, well controlled studies with Potassium Chloride Injection in pregnant women and animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this drug.  Therefore, it is not known whether potassium chloride injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Potassium Chloride Injection should be given during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is present in human milk. Because many drugs are present in human milk, caution should be exercised when Potassium Chloride Injection is administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use These products should not be used in children at this time. Safety and effectiveness of Potassium Chloride Injection in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well-controlled studies.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Potassium Chloride Injection were identified in postmarketing reports.
