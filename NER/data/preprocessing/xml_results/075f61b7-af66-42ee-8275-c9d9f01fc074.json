    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, has been reported. Discontinue Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction and should not be resumed unless another cause can be established. Avoid use in patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease ( 5.2 ) Orthostatic Hypotension, Falls and Syncope : Consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if these events occur ( 5.3 ) Serotonin Syndrome : Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue Duloxetine delayed-release capsules and serotonergic agents ( 5.4 ) Increased Risk of Bleeding : May increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.5 , 7.4 , 8.1 ) Severe Skin Reactions : Severe skin reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), can occur; Discontinue at the first appearance of blisters, peeling rash, mucosal erosions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity if no other etiology can be identified ( 5.6 ) Activation of Mania or Hypomania : Prior to initiating, screen patients for personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania ( 5.8 ) Angle-Closure Glaucoma : Has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants ( 5.9 ) Seizures : Prescribe with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder ( 5.10 ) Blood Pressure Increases : Monitor blood pressure prior to initiating treatment and periodically throughout treatment ( 5.11 ) Inhibitors of CYP1A2 or Thioridazine : Avoid co-administration with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules ( 5.12 ) Hyponatremia : Can occur in association with SIADH; consider discontinuation ( 5.13 ) Glucose Control in Diabetes : In DPNP patients, increases in fasting blood glucose, and HbA 1c have been observed ( 5.14 ) Conditions that Slow Gastric Emptying : Use cautiously in these patients ( 5.14 ) Sexual Dysfunction : Duloxetine delayed-release capsules may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk of differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1. Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer case â‰¥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric Duloxetine delayed-release capsules trials. There were suicides in the adult Duloxetine delayed-release capsules trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about Duloxetine delayed-release capsules effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms [see for descriptions of the risks of discontinuation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity There have been reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal, in patients treated with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. These cases have presented as hepatitis with abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevation of transaminase levels to more than twenty times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with or without jaundice, reflecting a mixed or hepatocellular pattern of liver injury. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of clinically significant liver dysfunction and should not be resumed unless another cause can be established. Cases of cholestatic jaundice with minimal elevation of transaminase levels have also been reported. Other postmarketing reports indicate that elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase have occurred in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules increased the risk of elevation of serum transaminase levels in development program clinical trials. Liver transaminase elevations resulted in the discontinuation of 0.3% (92/34,756) of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients. In most patients, the median time to detection of the transaminase elevation was about two months. In adult placebo-controlled trials, for patients with normal and abnormal baseline ALT values, elevation of ALT >3 times the ULN occurred in 1.25% (144/11,496) of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients compared to 0.45% (39/8716) of placebo-treated patients. In adult placebo- controlled studies using a fixed dose design, there was evidence of a Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dose response relationship for ALT and AST elevation of >3 times the ULN and >5 times the ULN, respectively. Because it is possible that Duloxetine delayed-release capsules and alcohol may interact to cause liver injury or that Duloxetine delayed-release capsules may aggravate pre-existing liver disease, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should not be prescribed to patients with substantial alcohol use or evidence of chronic liver disease. 5.3 Orthostatic Hypotension, Falls and Syncope Orthostatic hypotension, falls, and syncope have been reported in patients treated with the recommended Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of therapy but can occur at any time during Duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment, particularly after dose increases. The risk of falling appears to be related to the degree of orthostatic decrease in blood pressure (BP) as well as other factors that may increase the underlying risk of falls. In an analysis of patients from all placebo-controlled trials, patients treated with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules reported a higher rate of falls compared to patients treated with placebo. Risk appears to be related to the presence of orthostatic decrease in BP. The risk of BP decreases may be greater in patients taking concomitant medications that induce orthostatic hypotension (such as antihypertensives) or are potent CYP1A2 inhibitors [see and in patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules at doses above 60 mg daily. Consideration should be given to dose reduction or discontinuation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in patients who experience symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, falls and/or syncope during duloxetine therapy. Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Risk of falling also appeared to be proportional to a patient's underlying risk for falls and appeared to increase steadily with age. As geriatric patients tend to have a higher underlying risk for falls due to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as use of multiple medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself is unclear. Falls with serious consequences including fractures and hospitalizations have been reported with duloxetine use [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs, [see Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.13) ]. Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, discontinue Duloxetine delayed-release capsules before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.13) ]. Monitor all patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. A post-marketing study showed a higher incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in mothers taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Other bleeding events related to SSRI and SNRI use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), warfarin, and other anti- coagulants may add to this risk. Inform patients about the risk of increased bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ]. 5.6 Severe Skin Reactions Severe skin reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), can occur with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. The reporting rate of SJS associated with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules use exceeds the general population background incidence rate for this serious skin reaction (1 to 2 cases per million person years). The reporting rate is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be discontinued at the first appearance of blisters, peeling rash, mucosal erosions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity if no other etiology can be identified. 5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome Discontinuation symptoms have been systematically evaluated in patients taking Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Following abrupt or tapered discontinuation in adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following symptoms occurred at 1% or greater and at a significantly higher rate in Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients compared to those discontinuing from placebo: dizziness, headache, nausea, diarrhea, paresthesia, irritability, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and fatigue. During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the healthcare provider may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.8 Activation of Mania/Hypomania In adult placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, activation of mania or hypomania was reported in 0.1% (4/3779) of duloxetine-treated patients and 0.04% (1/2536) of placebo-treated patients. No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in DPNP, GAD, fibromyalgia, or chronic musculoskeletal pain placebo-controlled trials. Activation of mania or hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with mood disorders who were treated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. As with these other agents, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. 5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including duloxetine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. 5.10 Seizures Duloxetine has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder, and such patients were excluded from clinical studies. In adult placebo-controlled clinical trials, seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.02% (3/12,722) of patients treated with duloxetine and 0.01% (1/9513) of patients treated with placebo. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be prescribed with care in patients with a history of a seizure disorder. 5.11 Increases in Blood Pressure In adult placebo-controlled clinical trials across the approved adult populations from baseline to endpoint, duloxetine treatment was associated with mean increases of 0.5 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 0.8 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure compared to mean decreases of 0.6 mm Hg systolic and 0.3 mm Hg diastolic in placebo-treated patients. There was no significant difference in the frequency of sustained (3 consecutive visits) elevated blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study designed to evaluate the effects of duloxetine on various parameters, including blood pressure at supratherapeutic doses with an accelerated dose titration, there was evidence of increases in supine blood pressure at doses up to 200 mg twice daily (approximately 3.3 times the maximum recommended dosage). At the highest 200 mg twice daily dose, the increase in mean pulse rate was 5.0 to 6.8 beats and increases in mean blood pressure were 4.7 to 6.8 mm Hg (systolic) and 4.5 to 7 mm Hg (diastolic) up to 12 hours after dosing. Blood pressure should be measured prior to initiating treatment and periodically measured throughout treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.12 Clinically Important Drug Interactions Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 are responsible for duloxetine metabolism. Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Duloxetine delayed-release capsules CYP1A2 Inhibitors â€” Co-administration of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules with potent CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] CYP2D6 Inhibitors â€” Because CYP2D6 is involved in Duloxetine delayed-release capsules metabolism, concomitant use of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 would be expected to, and does, result in higher concentrations (on average of 60%) of duloxetine [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] Potential for Duloxetine delayed-release capsules to Affect Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 â€” Co-administration of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules with drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP2D6 and that have a narrow therapeutic index, including certain antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, and imipramine), phenothiazines and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be approached with caution. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored and the dose of the TCA may need to be reduced if a TCA is co-administered with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Because of the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules and thioridazine should not be co-administered [see . Drug Interactions (7.9) ] Other Clinically Important Drug Interactions Alcohol â€” Use of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules concomitantly with heavy alcohol intake may be associated with severe liver injury. For this reason, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should not be prescribed for patients with substantial alcohol use [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.15) ] CNS Acting Drugs â€” Given the primary CNS effects of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, it should be used with caution when it is taken in combination with or substituted for other centrally acting drugs, including those with a similar mechanism of action [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Drug Interactions (7.16) ] 5.13 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules use and appeared to be reversible when Duloxetine delayed-release capsules were discontinued. Geriatric patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk [see . Discontinuation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have been associated with hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. 5.14 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in patients with concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. There is no information on the effect that alterations in gastric motility may have on the stability of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules' enteric coating. In extremely acidic conditions, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, unprotected by the enteric coating, may undergo hydrolysis to form naphthol. Caution is advised in using Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in patients with conditions that may slow gastric emptying (e.g., some diabetics). Duloxetine delayed-release capsules have not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable coronary artery disease. Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. Hepatic Impairment Avoid use in patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.9) ]. Severe Renal Impairment Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment, GFR <30 mL/minute. Increased plasma concentration of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, and especially of its metabolites, occurred in patients with end-stage renal disease (requiring dialysis) [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Use in Specific Populations (8.10) ]. Glycemic Control in Patients with Diabetes As observed in DPNP trials, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment worsened glycemic control in some patients with diabetes. In three clinical trials of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy [see , the mean duration of diabetes was approximately 12 years, the mean baseline fasting blood glucose was 176 mg/dL, and the mean baseline hemoglobin A Clinical Studies (14.4) ] 1c (HbA 1c ) was 7.8%. In the 12-week acute treatment phase of these studies, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules was associated with a small increase in mean fasting blood glucose as compared to placebo. In the extension phase of these studies, which lasted up to 52 weeks, mean fasting blood glucose increased by 12 mg/dL in the Duloxetine delayed-release capsules group and decreased by 11.5 mg/dL in the routine care group. HbA 1c increased by 0.5% in the Duloxetine delayed-release capsules group and by 0.2% in the routine care group. 5.15 Urinary Hesitation and Retention Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are in a class of drugs known to affect urethral resistance. If symptoms of urinary hesitation develop during treatment with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, consideration should be given to the possibility that they might be drug-related. In post marketing experience, cases of urinary retention have been observed. In some instances of urinary retention associated with duloxetine use, hospitalization and/or catheterization has been needed. 5.16 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SNRIs, including Duloxetine delayed-release capsules, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see . In male patients, SNRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SNRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.",

The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of patients who experienced, at least once, one treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Adverse Reactions in Adults Adult Clinical Trial Database The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD (N=3779), GAD (N=1018), OA (N=503), CLBP (N=600), DPNP (N=906), and FM (N=1294). The age range in this pooled population was 17 to 89 years of age. In this pooled population, 66%, 61%, 61%, 43%, and 94% of adult patients were female; and 82%, 73%, 85%, 74%, and 86% of adult patients were Caucasian in the MDD, GAD, OA and CLBP, DPNP, and FM populations, respectively. Most patients received Duloxetine delayed-release capsules dosages of a total of 60 to 120 mg per day [see . The data below do not include results of the trial that evaluated the efficacy of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules for the treatment of GAD in patients â‰¥65 years old (Study GAD-5) Clinical Studies (14) ] [see ; however, the adverse reactions observed in this geriatric population were generally similar to adverse reactions in the overall adult population. Clinical Studies (14.3) ] Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials Major Depressive Disorder Approximately 8.4% (319/3779) of duloxetine-treated patients in placebo-controlled adult trials for MDD discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 4.6% (117/2536) of placebo-treated patients. Nausea (Duloxetine 1.1%, placebo 0.4%) was the only adverse reaction reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., discontinuation occurring in at least 1% of the duloxetine-treated patients and at a rate of at least twice that of placebo-treated patients). Generalized Anxiety Disorder Approximately 13.7% (139/1018) of the duloxetine-treated patients in placebo-controlled adult trials for GAD discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 5% (38/767) for placebo-treated patients. Common adverse reactions reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (as defined above) included nausea (Duloxetine 3.3%, placebo 0.4%), and dizziness (Duloxetine 1.3%, placebo 0.4%). Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Approximately 12.9% (117/906) of the duloxetine-treated patients in placebo-controlled adult trials for DPNP discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 5.1% (23/448) for placebo-treated patients. Common adverse reactions reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (as defined above) included nausea (Duloxetine 3.5%, placebo 0.7%), dizziness (Duloxetine 1.2%, placebo 0.4%), and somnolence (Duloxetine 1.1%, placebo 0%). Fibromyalgia Approximately 17.5% (227/1294) of the duloxetine-treated patients in 3- to 6-month placebo-controlled adult trials for FM discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 10.1% (96/955) for placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (as defined above) included nausea (Duloxetine 2.0%, placebo 0.5%), headache (Duloxetine 1.2%, placebo 0.3%), somnolence (Duloxetine 1.1%, placebo 0%), and fatigue (Duloxetine 1.1%, placebo 0.1%). Chronic Pain due to Osteoarthritis Approximately 15.7% (79/503) of the duloxetine-treated patients in 13-week, placebo-controlled adult trials for chronic pain due to OA discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 7.3% (37/508) for placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (as defined above) included nausea (Duloxetine 2.2%, placebo 1%). Chronic Low Back Pain Approximately 16.5% (99/600) of the duloxetine-treated patients in 13-week, placebo-controlled adult trials for CLBP discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 6.3% (28/441) for placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions reported as a reason for discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (as defined above) included nausea (Duloxetine 3%, placebo 0.7%), and somnolence (Duloxetine 1%, placebo 0%). Most Common Adverse Reactions in Adult Trials The most commonly observed adverse reactions in Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients (as defined above) were: Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain: nausea, somnolence, decreased appetite, constipation, hyperhidrosis, and dry mouth. Fibromyalgia: nausea, dry mouth, constipation, somnolence, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, and agitation. Chronic Pain due to Osteoarthritis: nausea, fatigue, constipation, dry mouth, insomnia, somnolence, and dizziness. Chronic Low Back Pain: nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, somnolence, constipation, dizziness, and fatigue. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients in all the pooled adult populations (i.e., MDD, GAD, DPNP, FM, OA, and CLBP) (incidence of at least 5% and at least twice the incidence in placebo-treated patients) were nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, constipation, decreased appetite, and hyperhidrosis. Table 2 displays the incidence of adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials for approved adult populations (i.e., MDD, GAD, DPNP, FM, OA, and CLBP) that occurred in 5% or more of duloxetine-treated patients and with an incidence greater than placebo-treated patients.

Because adverse sexual reactions are presumed to be voluntarily underreported, the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX), a validated measure designed to identify sexual adverse reactions, was used prospectively in 4 MDD placebo-controlled adult trials (Studies MDD-1, MDD-2, MDD-3, and MDD-4) [see The ASEX scale includes five questions that pertain to the following aspects of sexual function: 1) sex drive, 2) ease of arousal, 3) ability to achieve erection (men) or lubrication (women), 4) ease of reaching orgasm, and 5) orgasm satisfaction. Positive numbers signify a worsening of sexual function from baseline. Negative numbers signify an improvement from a baseline level of dysfunction, which is commonly seen in depressed patients. Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. In these trials, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated male patients experienced significantly more sexual dysfunction, as measured by the total score on the ASEX and the ability to reach orgasm, than placebo-treated male patients (see Table 5 ). Duloxetine delayed-release capsules- treated female patients did not experience more sexual dysfunction than placebo-treated female patients as measured by ASEX total score. Healthcare providers should routinely inquire about possible sexual adverse reactions in Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients. Table 5: Mean Change in ASEX Scores by Gender in MDD Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials Male Patients n=Number of patients with non-missing change score for ASEX total. Female Patients Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (n=175) Placebo (n=83) Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (n=241) Placebo (n=126) ASEX Total (Items 1-5) 0.56 p=0.013 versus placebo. -1.07 -1.15 -1.07 Item 1- Sex drive -0.07 -0.12 -0.32 -0.24 Item 2 - Arousal 0.01 -0.26 -0.21 -0.18 Item 3 - Ability to achieve erection (men); Lubrication (women) 0.03 -0.25 -0.17 -0.18 Item 4 - Ease of reaching orgasm 0.40 p<0.001 versus placebo. -0.24 -0.09 -0.13 Item 5 - Orgasm satisfaction 0.09 -0.13 -0.11 -0.17 Vital Sign Changes in Adults In placebo-controlled clinical trials across approved adult populations for change from baseline to endpoint, duloxetine-treated patients had mean increases of 0.23 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.73 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) compared to mean decreases of 1.09 mm Hg in SBP and 0.55 mm Hg in DBP in placebo-treated patients. There was no significant difference in the frequency of sustained (3 consecutive visits) elevated blood pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.11) ]. Duloxetine treatment, for up to 26 weeks in placebo-controlled trials across approved adult populations, typically caused a small increase in heart rate for change from baseline to endpoint compared to placebo of up to 1.37 beats per minute (increase of 1.20 beats per minute in duloxetine-treated patients, decrease of 0.17 beats per minute in placebo-treated patients). Laboratory Changes in Adults Duloxetine delayed-release capsules treatment in placebo-controlled clinical trials across approved adult populations, was associated with small mean increases from baseline to endpoint in ALT, AST, CPK, and alkaline phosphatase; infrequent, modest, transient, abnormal values were observed for these analytes in Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients when compared with placebo-treated patients [see High bicarbonate, cholesterol, and abnormal (high or low) potassium, were observed more frequently in Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Clinical Trial Evaluation of Duloxetine in Adults Following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated with duloxetine in clinical adult trials. In clinical trials of all approved adult populations, 34,756 patients were treated with duloxetine. Of these, 27% (9337) took duloxetine for at least 6 months, and 12% (4317) took duloxetine at least one year.

Adverse Reactions Observed in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Clinical Trial Database The data described below reflect exposure to duloxetine (N=567) in pediatric patients aged 7 to 18 years of age from two 10-week, placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD (N=341) (Studies MDD-6 and MDD-7), one 10-week placebo- controlled trial in GAD (N=135) (Study GAD-6), and a 13-week trial in fibromyalgia (N=91). Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are not approved for the treatment of MDD in pediatric patients [see . Of the duloxetine-treated patients in these studies, 36% were 7 to 11 years of age (64% were between 12 to 18 years old), 55% were female, and 69% were Caucasian. Patients received 30 to 120 mg of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules per day during placebo-controlled acute treatment studies. In the pediatric MDD, GAD, and fibromyalgia trials up to 40 weeks long, there were 988 duloxetine-treated pediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years of age (most patients received 30-120 mg per day) â€“ 35% were 7 to 11 years of age (65% were 12 to 17 years old) and 56% were female. Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Most Common Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Trials The most common adverse reactions (â‰¥5% in duloxetine-treated patients and at least twice the incidence of placebo- treated patients) in all pooled pediatric populations (MDD, GAD, and fibromyalgia) were decreased weight, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and diarrhea. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Aged 7 to 17 Years Old with MDD and GAD The adverse reaction profile observed in clinical trials in pediatric patients aged 7 to 18 years old with MDD and GAD was consistent with the adverse reaction profile observed in adult clinical trials. The most common (â‰¥5% and twice placebo) adverse reactions observed in these pediatric clinical trials included: nausea, diarrhea, decreased weight, and dizziness. Table 6 provides the incidence of adverse reactions in MDD and GAD pediatric placebo-controlled trials that occurred in greater than 2% of patients treated with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules and with an incidence greater than patients treated with placebo. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are not approved in the treatment of MDD in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Table 6: Adverse Reactions: Incidence of 2% or More and Greater than Placebo in Three 10-week Pediatric Placebo-Controlled Trials in MDD and GAD Duloxetine delayed-release capsules are not approved for the treatment of pediatric MDD [see The inclusion of an event in the table is determined based on the percentages before rounding; however, the percentages displayed in the table are rounded to the nearest integer. Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. System Organ Class / Adverse Reaction Percentage of Pediatric Patients Reporting Reaction Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (N=476) Placebo (N=362) Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 18 8 Abdominal Pain Also includes abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain lower, abdominal tenderness, abdominal discomfort, and gastrointestinal pain. 13 10 Vomiting 9 4 Diarrhea 6 3 Dry Mouth 2 1 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue Also includes asthenia. 7 5 Investigations Decreased Weight Frequency based on weight measurement meeting potentially clinically significant threshold of â‰¥3.5% weight loss (N=467 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules; N=354 Placebo). 14 6 Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased Appetite 10 5 Nervous System Disorders Headache 18 13 Somnolence Also includes hypersomnia and sedation. 11 6 Dizziness 8 4 Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia Also includes initial insomnia, insomnia, middle insomnia, and terminal insomnia. 7 4 Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Oropharyngeal Pain 4 2 Cough 3 1 Other adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of less than 2% and were reported by more duloxetine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients in pediatric MDD and GAD clinical trials included: abnormal dreams (including nightmare), anxiety, flushing (including hot flush), hyperhidrosis, palpitations, pulse increased, and tremor (Duloxetine delayed-release capsules is not approved to treat pediatric patients with MDD). The most commonly reported symptoms following discontinuation of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules in pediatric MDD and GAD clinical trials included headache, dizziness, insomnia, and abdominal pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Growth (Height and Weight) in Pediatric Patients 7 to 17 Years Old with GAD and MDD Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs and SNRIs. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated pediatric patients in clinical trials experienced a 0.1 kg mean decrease in weight at 10 weeks, compared with a mean weight gain of approximately 0.9 kg in placebo-treated pediatric patients. The proportion of patients who experienced a clinically significant decrease in weight (â‰¥3.5%) was greater in the Duloxetine delayed-release capsules group than in the placebo group (16% and 6%, respectively). Subsequently, over the 4- to 6-month uncontrolled extension periods, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated patients on average trended toward recovery to their expected baseline weight percentile based on population data from age- and sex-matched peers. In studies up to 9 months, Duloxetine delayed-release capsules-treated pediatric patients experienced an increase in height of 1.7 cm on average (2.2 cm increase in patients 7 to 11 years of age and 1.3 cm increase in patients 12 to 17 years of age). While height increase was observed during these studies, a mean decrease of 1% in height percentile was observed (decrease of 2% in patients 7 to 11 years of age and increase of 0.3% in patients 12 to 17 years of age). Weight and height should be monitored regularly in pediatric patients treated with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Aged 13 to 17 Years Old with Fibromyalgia Table 7 provides the incidence of adverse reactions in a fibromyalgia pediatric placebo-controlled trial (Study FM-4) that occurred in greater than 5% of patients treated with Duloxetine delayed-release capsules and with an incidence greater than patients treated with placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Table 7: Adverse Reactions: Incidence of 5% or More and Greater than Placebo in a 13-week Placebo-Controlled Trial in Pediatric Patients 13 to 17 Years Old with Fibromyalgia (Study FM-4) The inclusion of an event in the table is determined based on the percentages before rounding; however, the percentages displayed in the table are rounded to the nearest integer. Duloxetine delayed-release capsules (N=91) Placebo (N=93) Nausea 25% 15% Decreased appetite 15% 3% Vomiting 15% 5% Decreased weight Frequency based on weight measurement meeting potentially clinically significant threshold of â‰¥3.5% weight loss (N=89 Duloxetine delayed-release capsules; N=92 Placebo). 15% 5% Headache 14% 11% Nasopharyngitis 9% 2% Somnolence 9% 3% Upper respiratory tract infection 7% 2% Viral gastroenteritis 5% 0% Fatigue 5% 2% 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Duloxetine delayed-release capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction that were temporally related to Duloxetine delayed-release capsules therapy and not mentioned elsewhere in labeling include: acute pancreatitis, anaphylactic reaction, aggression and anger (particularly early in treatment or after treatment discontinuation), angioneurotic edema, angle-closure glaucoma, colitis (microscopic or unspecified), cutaneous vasculitis (sometimes associated with systemic involvement), extrapyramidal disorder, galactorrhea, gynecological bleeding, hallucinations, hyperglycemia, hyperprolactinemia, hypersensitivity, hypertensive crisis, muscle spasm, rash, restless legs syndrome, seizures upon treatment discontinuation, supraventricular arrhythmia, tinnitus (upon treatment discontinuation), trismus, and urticaria."
