    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE TOLSURA is indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised adult patients: Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Specimens for fungal cultures and other relevant laboratory studies (wet mount, histopathology, serology) should be obtained before therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-fungal therapy should be adjusted accordingly TOLSURA is an azole antifungal indicated for the treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised adult patients ( 1 ): Blastomycosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and disseminated, non-meningeal histoplasmosis, and Aspergillosis, pulmonary and extrapulmonary, in patients who are intolerant of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy. Limitations of Use: TOLSURA is not indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis ( 1 ) TOLSURA is NOT interchangeable or substitutable with other itraconazole products ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: TOLSURA is not indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis. TOLSURA is NOT interchangeable or substitutable with other itraconazole products due to the differences in the dosing between TOLSURA and other itraconazole products. Therefore, follow the specific dosage recommendations for TOLSURA [see Dosage and Administration (2) ].",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Co-administration with certain drugs that either affect metabolism of itraconazole or whose metabolism is affected by itraconazole. ( 4.1 ) Hypersensitivity to itraconazole ( 4.2 ) 4.1 Drug Interactions Co-administration of certain drugs that are metabolized by human CYP3A4 substrates are contraindicated with TOLSURA because plasma concentrations of such drugs are increased, which may also increase or prolong both the pharmacologic effects and/or adverse reactions to these drugs [see . Warnings and Precaution (5.5) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Co-administration with colchicine, fesoterodine and solifenacin is contraindicated in subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment. Co-administration with eliglustat is contraindicated in subjects that are poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6 and in subjects taking strong or moderate CYP2D6 inhibitors [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs due to co-administration of TOLSURA can lead to QT prolongation and ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes , a potentially fatal arrhythmia [ see .

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death were reported with the use of itraconazole. Discontinue treatment if signs of liver dysfunction occur ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Dysrhythmias : Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using certain drugs that are metabolized by human CYP450 enzymes concomitantly with oral itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. ( 4 , 5.3 , 5.5 ) Pseudoaldosteronism : Manifested by the onset or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary ( 5.4 ). Peripheral Neuropathy : This has been reported in patients on long-term therapy with itraconazole. Monitor and promptly evaluate neurologic symptoms. ( 5.6 ) Hearing Loss : Reversible or permanent has been reported in patients. Discontinue treatment if hearing loss occurs ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure TOLSURA can cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure (CHF) [see For patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as CHF, history or risk factors for CHF, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of TOLSURA therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Inform such patients of the signs and symptoms of CHF and monitor carefully for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear or worsen during administration of TOLSURA, reassess the benefit-risk of continuing treatment. Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was demonstrated. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later. Itraconazole has been associated with reports of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving higher total daily doses of itraconazole of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers, monitor carefully for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of TOLSURA and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1) , Drug Interactions (7.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Itraconazole has been associated with cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, discontinue treatment and perform testing for liver disease. Continued TOLSURA use or reinstitution of treatment with TOLSURA is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.3 Cardiac Dysrhythmias Life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias and/or sudden death have occurred in patients using drugs such as, pimozide, methadone, or quinidine concomitantly with oral itraconazole and/or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant administration of these drugs with TOLSURA is contraindicated [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.4\tPseudoaldosteronism Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevate 11-deoxycortisol), has been reported with itraconazole use in the postmarketing setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of TOLSURA, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. 5.5 Drug Interaction Potential Itraconazole has a potential for clinically important drug interactions [see . Co-administration of specific drugs with TOLSURA may result in changes in the efficacy of itraconazole and/or the co-administered drug, life-threatening effects and/or sudden death. Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] [see Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. 5.6 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients on long-term therapy with itraconazole. Monitor for and promptly evaluate neurologic symptoms. If neuropathy attributable to TOLSURA occurs, discontinue treatment. 5.7 Hearing Loss Reversible or permanent hearing loss has been reported in patients receiving treatment with itraconazole. Several of these reports included concurrent administration of quinidine which is contraindicated [see and Boxed Warning , Contraindications (4.2) . The hearing loss usually resolves when treatment is stopped but can persist in some patients. Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.8 Hypersensitivity Reactions TOLSURA is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to itraconazole [see Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of itraconazole Contraindications (4.2) ]. [see . Due to the limited information regarding cross-hypersensitivity between itraconazole and other azole antifungal drugs, careful enquiry about previous hypersensitivity to other azole antifungal drugs should be made when prescribing TOLSURA. If hypersensitivity reactions to TOLSURA occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]",
