  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Quetiapine tablets are an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of: Schizophrenia ( 1.1 ) Bipolar I disorder manic episodes ( 1.2 ) Bipolar disorder, depressive episodes ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Schizophrenia Quetiapine tablets are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. The efficacy of quetiapine tablets in schizophrenia was established in three 6-week trials in adults and one 6-week trial in adolescents ( 13 to 17 years ) . The effectiveness of quetiapine tablets for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] 1.2 Bipolar Disorder Quetiapine tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two 12-week monotherapy trials in adults, in one 3-week adjunctive trial in adults, and in one 3-week monotherapy trial in pediatric patients ( 10 to 17 years ) [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] Quetiapine tablets are indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Efficacy was established in two 8-week monotherapy trials in adult patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorder [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] Quetiapine tablets are indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two maintenance trials in adults. The effectiveness of quetiapine tablets as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see . Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] 1.3 Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders, however, diagnosis can be challenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.",

  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions: Increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions ( e.g. , stroke, transient ischemic attack ) has been seen in elderly patients with dementia-related psychoses treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs ( 5.3 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) : Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring ( 5.4 ) Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with metabolic changes. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain ( 5.5 ) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended, including fasting blood lipid testing at the beginning of, and periodically, during treatment Weight Gain: Gain in body weight has been observed; clinical monitoring of weight is recommended Tardive Dyskinesia: Discontinue if clinically appropriate ( 5.6 ) Hypotension: Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease ( 5.7 ) Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents: Monitor blood pressure at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment in children and adolescents ( 5.9 ) Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis: Monitor complete blood count frequently during the first few months of treatment in patients with a pre-existing low white cell count or a history of leukopenia/neutropenia and discontinue quetiapine at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors ( 5.10 ) Cataracts: Lens changes have been observed in patients during long-term quetiapine treatment. Lens examination is recommended when starting treatment and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment ( 5.11 ) Anticholinergic ( antimuscarinic ) Effects: Use with caution with other anticholinergic drugs and in patients with urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation ( 5.20 ) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials ( modal duration of 10 weeks ) , largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5% , compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e.g. , heart failure, sudden death ) or infectious ( e.g. , pneumonia ) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic ( s ) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ] . 5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults Patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior ( suicidality ) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs ( SSRIs and others ) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior ( suicidality ) in children, adolescents, and young adults ( ages 18 to 24 ) with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4.400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials ( median duration of 2 months ) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77.000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences ( drug vs. placebo ) , however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences ( drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1.000 patients treated ) are provided in Table 2. Table 2: Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1.000 Patients Treated Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1.000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e. , beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia ( psychomotor restlessness ) , hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Prescriptions for quetiapine should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed ( though not established in controlled trials ) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: 5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions ( cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks ) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated subjects. Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see also Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia ) . Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness ( e.g. , pneumonia, systemic infection, etc. ) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms ( EPS ) . Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system ( CNS ) pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1 ) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2 ) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3 ) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported. 5.5 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose, and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these metabolic profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus ( e.g. , obesity, family history of diabetes ) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. Adults: Table 3: Fasting Glucose — Proportion of Patients Shifting to ≥126 mg/dL in Short-Term ( ≤12 weeks ) Placebo-Controlled Studies 1 1. Includes quetiapine and SEROQUEL XR data.

The mean change in fasting glucose from baseline was 3.2 mg/dL and mean change in 2-hour glucose from baseline was -1.8 mg/dL for quetiapine. In 2 long-term placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal clinical trials for bipolar I disorder maintenance, mean exposure of 213 days for quetiapine ( 646 patients ) and 152 days for placebo ( 680 patients ) , the mean change in glucose from baseline was +5 mg/dL for quetiapine and -0.05 mg/dL for placebo. The exposure-adjusted rate of any increased blood glucose level ( ≥126 mg/dL ) for patients more than 8 hours since a meal ( however, some patients may not have been precluded from calorie intake from fluids during fasting period ) was 18 per 100 patient years for quetiapine ( 10.7% of patients; n=556 ) and 9.5 for placebo per 100 patient years ( 4.6% of patients; n=581 ) . Children and Adolescents: In a placebo-controlled quetiapine monotherapy study of adolescent patients ( 13 to 17 years of age ) with schizophrenia ( 6 weeks duration ) , the mean change in fasting glucose levels for quetiapine ( n=138 ) compared to placebo ( n=67 ) was –0.75 mg/dL versus –1.7 mg/dL. In a placebo-controlled quetiapine monotherapy study of children and adolescent patients ( 10 to 17 years of age ) with bipolar mania ( 3 weeks duration ) , the mean change in fasting glucose level for quetiapine ( n=170 ) compared to placebo ( n=81 ) was 3.62 mg/dL versus –1.17 mg/dL. No patient in either study with a baseline normal fasting glucose level ( <100 mg/dL ) or a baseline borderline fasting glucose level ( ≥100 mg/dL and <126 mg/dL ) had a blood glucose level of ≥126 mg/dL. In a placebo-controlled SEROQUEL XR monotherapy study ( 8 weeks duration ) of children and adolescent patients ( 10 to 17 years of age ) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the mean change in fasting glucose levels for SEROQUEL XR ( n=60 ) compared to placebo ( n=62 ) was 1.8 mg/dL versus 1.6 mg/dL. In this study, there were no patients in the SEROQUEL XR or placebo-treated groups with a baseline normal fasting glucose level ( <100 mg/dL ) that had an increase in blood glucose level >126 mg/dL. There was one patient in the SEROQUEL XR group with a baseline borderline fasting glucose level ( >100 mg/dL and <126 mg/dL ) who had an increase in blood glucose level of >126 mg/dL compared to zero patients in the placebo group.

Weight Gain Increases in weight have been observed in clinical trials. Patients receiving quetiapine should receive regular monitoring of weight. Adults: In clinical trials with quetiapine the following increases in weight have been reported.

Table 7: Proportion of Patients with Weight Gain ≥7% of Body Weight ( Children and Adolescents ) 1. 6 weeks duration 2. 3 weeks duration Vital Sign Indication Treatment Arm N Patients n ( % ) Weight Gain ≥7% of Body Weight Schizophrenia 1 Quetiapine 111 23 ( 21% ) Placebo 44 3 ( 7% ) Bipolar Mania 2 Quetiapine 157 18 ( 12% ) Placebo 68 0 ( 0% ) The mean change in body weight in the schizophrenia trial was 2 kg in the quetiapine group and -0.4 kg in the placebo group and in the bipolar mania trial, it was 1.7 kg in the quetiapine group and 0.4 kg in the placebo group. In an open-label study that enrolled patients from the above two pediatric trials, 63% of patients ( 241/380 ) completed 26 weeks of therapy with quetiapine. After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean increase in body weight was 4.4 kg. Forty-five percent of the patients gained ≥7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. In order to adjust for normal growth over 26 weeks, an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change; 18.3% of patients on quetiapine met this criterion after 26 weeks of treatment. In a clinical trial for SEROQUEL XR in children and adolescents ( 10 to 17 years of age ) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the percentage of patients with weight gain ≥7% of body weight at any time was 15% ( 14/92 ) for SEROQUEL XR vs. 10% ( 10/100 ) for placebo. The mean change in body weight was 1.4 kg in the SEROQUEL XR group vs. 0.6 kg in the placebo group. When treating pediatric patients with quetiapine for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected for normal growth. 5.6 Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress ( or partially suppress ) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, quetiapine should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that ( 1 ) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and ( 2 ) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on quetiapine, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with quetiapine despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.7 Hypotension Quetiapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its α 1 -adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 1% ( 28/3.265 ) of the patients treated with quetiapine, compared with 0.2% ( 2/954 ) on placebo and about 0.4% ( 2/527 ) on active control drugs. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope may lead to falls. Quetiapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) . The risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to 25 mg twice daily [ see . If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate. Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] 5.8 Falls Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor, and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.9 Increases in Blood Pressure ( Children and Adolescents ) In placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with schizophrenia ( 6-week duration ) or bipolar mania ( 3-week duration ) , the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure ( ≥20 mmHg ) was 15.2% ( 51/335 ) for quetiapine and 5.5% ( 9/163 ) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure ( ≥10 mmHg ) was 40.6% ( 136/335 ) for quetiapine and 24.5% ( 40/163 ) for placebo. In the 26-week open-label clinical trial, one child with a reported history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment. In a placebo-controlled SEROQUEL XR clinical trial ( 8 weeks duration ) in children and adolescents ( 10 to 17 years of age ) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure ( ≥20 mmHg ) was 6.5% ( 6/92 ) for SEROQUEL XR and 6% ( 6/100 ) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure ( ≥10 mmHg ) was 46.7% ( 43/92 ) for SEROQUEL XR and 36% ( 36/100 ) for placebo. 5.10 Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine. Agranulocytosis has been reported. Agranulocytosis ( defined as absolute neutrophil count <500/mm 3 ) has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal cases and cases in patients without pre-existing risk factors. Neutropenia should be considered in patients presenting with infection, particularly in the absence of obvious predisposing factor ( s ) , or in patients with unexplained fever, and should be managed as clinically appropriate. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white cell count ( WBC ) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count ( CBC ) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue quetiapine at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count <1.000/mm 3 ) should discontinue quetiapine and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.11 Cataracts The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies [see . Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children, and adolescents during long-term quetiapine treatment, but a causal relationship to quetiapine use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment. Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 ) ] 5.12 QT Prolongation In clinical trials, quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience, there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine [see , in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval Overdosage ( 10.1 ) ] [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1 A antiarrythmics ( e.g. , quinidine, procainamide ) or Class III antiarrythmics ( e.g. , amiodarone, sotalol ) , antipsychotic medications ( e.g. , ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine ) , antibiotics ( e.g. , gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin ) , or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval ( e.g. , pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone ) . Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death including ( 1 ) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia; ( 2 ) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; ( 3 ) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and ( 4 ) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure, and heart hypertrophy ) . 5.13 Seizures During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.5% ( 20/3.490 ) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 0.2% ( 2/954 ) on placebo and 0.7% ( 4/527 ) on active control drugs. As with other antipsychotics, quetiapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g. , Alzheimer’s dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.14 Hypothyroidism Adults: Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine ( T 4 ) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T 4 , irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patient’s thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T 4 , in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at follow-up. In the mania adjunct studies, where quetiapine was added to lithium or divalproex, 12% ( 24/196 ) of quetiapine treated patients compared to 7% ( 15/203 ) of placebo-treated patients had elevated TSH levels. Of the quetiapine treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 3 had simultaneous low free T 4 levels ( free T 4 <0.8 LLN ) . About 0.7% ( 26/3.489 ) of quetiapine patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment. In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were 1 : decrease in free T 4 ( <0.8 LLN ) , 2% ( 357/17.513 ) ; decrease in total T 4 ( <0.8 LLN ) , 4% ( 75/1.861 ) ; decrease in free T 3 ( <0.8 LLN ) , 0.4% ( 53/13.766 ) ; decrease in total T 3 ( <0.8 LLN ) , 2% ( 26/1.312 ) , and increase in TSH ( >5 mlU/L ) , 4.9% ( 956/19.412 ) . In eight patients, where TBG was measured, levels of TBG were unchanged. Table 8 shows the incidence of these shifts in short-term placebo-controlled clinical trials. Table 8: Incidence of Shifts in Thyroid Hormone Levels and TSH in Short-Term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials 1.2 1. Based on shifts from normal baseline to potentially clinically important value at any time post-baseline. Shifts in total T 4 , free T 4 , total T 3, and free T 3 are defined as <0.8 x LLN ( pmol/L ) and shift in TSH is >5 mlU/L at any time. 2. Includes quetiapine and SEROQUEL XR data. Total T 4 Free T 4 Total T 3 Free T 3 TSH Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo 3.4 % 0.6% 0.7% 0.1% 0.5% 0% 0.2% 0% 3.2% 2.7% ( 37/1.097 ) ( 4/651 ) ( 52/7.218 ) ( 4/3.668 ) ( 2/369 ) ( 0/113 ) ( 11/5.673 ) ( 1/2.679 ) ( 240/7.587 ) ( 105/3.912 ) In short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, the incidence of reciprocal, shifts in T 3 and TSH was 0% for both quetiapine ( 1/4.800 ) and placebo ( 0/2.190 ) and for T 4 and TSH the shifts were 0.1% ( 7/6.154 ) for quetiapine versus 0% ( 1/3.007 ) for placebo. Children and Adolescents: In acute placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescent patients with schizophrenia ( 6-week duration ) or bipolar mania ( 3-week duration ) , the incidence of shifts for thyroid function values at any time for quetiapine treated patients and placebo-treated patients for elevated TSH was 2.9% ( 8/280 ) vs. 0.7% ( 1/138 ) , respectively, and for decreased total thyroxine was 2.8% ( 8/289 ) vs. 0% ( 0/145 ) , respectively. Of the quetiapine treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 1 had simultaneous low free T 4 level at end of treatment. 5.15 Hyperprolactinemia Adults: During clinical trials with quetiapine, the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a clinically significant value occurred in 3.6% ( 158/4.416 ) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 2.6% ( 51/1.968 ) on placebo. Children and Adolescents: In acute placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania ( 3-week duration ) or schizophrenia ( 6-week duration ) , the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a value ( >20 mcg/L males; >26 mcg/L females at any time ) was 13.4% ( 18/134 ) for quetiapine compared to 4% ( 3/75 ) for placebo in males and 8.7% ( 9/104 ) for quetiapine compared to 0% ( 0/39 ) for placebo in females. Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D 2 receptors, quetiapine elevates prolactin levels in some patients and the elevation may persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia ( mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary, and pancreatic adenomas ) was observed in carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see . Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer. Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ] 5.16 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse event reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3 to 5 day period of initial dose-titration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 18% ( 89/510 ) of patients on quetiapine compared to 11% ( 22/206 ) of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine as monotherapy, somnolence was reported in 16% ( 34/209 ) of patients on quetiapine compared to 4% of placebo patients. In acute bipolar mania trials using quetiapine as adjunct therapy, somnolence was reported in 34% ( 66/196 ) of patients on quetiapine compared to 9% ( 19/203 ) of placebo patients. In bipolar depression trials, somnolence was reported in 57% ( 398/698 ) of patients on quetiapine compared to 15% ( 51/347 ) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle ( including automobiles ) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls. 5.17 Body Temperature Regulation Although not reported with quetiapine, disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing quetiapine for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g. , exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. 5.18 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. 5.19 Discontinuation Syndrome Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea, and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with SEROQUEL XR that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% ( 241/1.993 ) for SEROQUEL XR and 6.7% ( 71/1.065 ) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions ( i.e. , insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, and irritability ) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1 week post-discontinuation. Gradual withdrawal is advised. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] 5.20 Anticholinergic ( antimuscarinic ) Effects Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when quetiapine is used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. Quetiapine should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic ( antimuscarinic ) effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) , Overdosage ( 10.1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ] . Constipation was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with quetiapine and represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal reports in patients who were receiving multiple concomitant medications that decrease intestinal motility. Quetiapine should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation.",

Adults: The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine consisting of over 4.300 patients. This database includes 698 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of bipolar depression, 405 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar mania ( monotherapy and adjunct therapy ) , 646 patients exposed to quetiapine for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder as adjunct therapy, and approximately 2.600 patients and/or normal subjects exposed to 1 or more doses of quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Of these approximately 4.300 subjects, approximately 4.000 ( 2.300 in schizophrenia, 405 in acute bipolar mania, 698 in bipolar depression, and 646 for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder ) were patients who participated in multiple dose effectiveness trials, and their experience corresponded to approximately 2.400 patient-years. The conditions and duration of treatment with quetiapine varied greatly and included ( in overlapping categories ) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term or longer-term exposure. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, ECGs, and results of ophthalmologic examinations. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, an adverse reaction of the type listed. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Schizophrenia: Overall, there was little difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions ( 4% for quetiapine vs. 3% for placebo ) in a pool of controlled trials. However, discontinuations due to somnolence ( 0.8% quetiapine vs. 0% placebo ) and hypotension ( 0.4% quetiapine vs. 0% placebo ) were considered to be drug related [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 and 5.19 ) ] Bipolar Disorder: Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 5.7% for quetiapine vs. 5.1% for placebo in monotherapy and 3.6% for quetiapine vs. 5.9% for placebo in adjunct therapy. Mania: Overall, discontinuations due to adverse reactions were 12.3% for quetiapine 300 mg vs. 19% for quetiapine 600 mg and 5.2% for placebo. Depression: Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: In the acute therapy of schizophrenia ( up to 6 weeks ) and bipolar mania ( up to 12 weeks ) trials, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine monotherapy ( incidence of 5% or greater ) and observed at a rate on quetiapine at least twice that of placebo were somnolence ( 18% ) , dizziness ( 11% ) , dry mouth ( 9% ) , constipation ( 8% ) , ALT increased ( 5% ) , weight gain ( 5% ) , and dyspepsia ( 5% ) . Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More Among Quetiapine Treated Patients in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: The prescriber should be aware that the figures in the tables and tabulations cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side effect incidence in the population studied. Table 9 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during acute therapy of schizophrenia ( up to 6 weeks ) and bipolar mania ( up to 12 weeks ) in 2% or more of patients treated with quetiapine ( doses ranging from 75 to 800 mg/day ) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Dose-related Adverse Reactions: Spontaneously elicited adverse reaction data from a study of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine ( 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 750 mg/day ) to placebo were explored for dose-relatedness of adverse reactions. Logistic regression analyses revealed a positive dose response ( p<0.05 ) for the following adverse reactions: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and weight gain. Adverse Reactions in clinical trials with quetiapine and not listed elsewhere in the label: The following adverse reactions have also been reported with quetiapine: nightmares, hypersensitivity, and elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase ( not associated with NMS ) , galactorrhea, bradycardia ( which may occur at or near initiation of treatment and be associated with hypotension and/or syncope ) decreased platelets, somnambulism ( and other related events ) , elevations in gamma-GT levels, hypothermia, dyspnea, eosinophilia, urinary retention, intestinal obstruction and priapism. Extrapyramidal Symptoms ( EPS ) : Dystonia Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Four methods were used to measure EPS: ( 1 ) Simpson-Angus total score ( mean change from baseline ) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, ( 2 ) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) Global Assessment Score, ( 3 ) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS ( akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor ) , and ( 4 ) use of anticholinergic medications to treat EPS. Adults: Data from one 6-week clinical trial of schizophrenia comparing five fixed doses of quetiapine ( 75, 150, 300, 600, 750 mg/day ) provided evidence for the lack of extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) and dose-relatedness for EPS associated with quetiapine treatment. Three methods were used to measure EPS: ( 1 ) Simpson-Angus total score ( mean change from baseline ) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, ( 2 ) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS ( akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor ) , and ( 3 ) use of anticholinergic medications to EPS. In Table 12, dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, muscle rigidity, oculogyration; parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity, tremor, drooling, hypokinesia; akathisia included akathisia, psychomotor agitation; dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, choreoathetosis; and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness, extrapyramidal disorder, movement disorder.

The rate of anticholinergic medication use to treat EPS for placebo and the five fixed doses was: 14% ; 11% ; 10% ; 8% ; 12% , and 11% . In six additional placebo-controlled clinical trials ( 3 in acute mania and 3 in schizophrenia ) using variable doses of quetiapine, there were no differences between the quetiapine and placebo treatment groups in the incidence of EPS, as assessed by Simpson-Angus total scores, spontaneous complaints of EPS and the use of concomitant anticholinergic medications to treat EPS. In two placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of bipolar depression using 300 mg and 600 mg of quetiapine, the incidence of adverse reactions potentially related to EPS was 12% in both dose groups and 6% in the placebo group. In these studies, the incidence of the individual adverse reactions ( akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, restlessness, muscle contractions involuntary, psychomotor hyperactivity, and muscle rigidity ) were generally low and did not exceed 4% in any treatment group. The 3 treatment groups were similar in mean change in SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score at the end of treatment. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and similar across the three treatment groups. Children and Adolescents The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine consisting of over 1.000 pediatric patients. This database includes 677 patients exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and 393 children and adolescents ( 10 to 17 years old ) exposed to quetiapine for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Schizophrenia: The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapine-­treated and placebo-treated patients was 8.2% and 2.7% , respectively. The adverse event leading to discontinuation in 1% or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo was somnolence ( 2.7% and 0% for placebo ) . Bipolar I Mania: The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapine-treated and placebo-treated patients was 11.4% and 4.4% , respectively. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in 2% or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo were somnolence ( 4.1% vs. 1.1% ) and fatigue ( 2.1% vs. 0 ) . Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials In therapy for schizophrenia ( up to 6 weeks ) , the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in adolescents ( incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo ) were somnolence ( 34% ) , dizziness ( 12% ) , dry mouth ( 7% ) , tachycardia ( 7% ) . In bipolar mania therapy ( up to 3 weeks ) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents ( incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo ) were somnolence ( 53% ) , dizziness ( 18% ) , fatigue ( 11% ) , increased appetite ( 9% ) , nausea ( 8% ) , vomiting ( 8% ) , tachycardia ( 7% ) , dry mouth ( 7% ) , and weight increased ( 6% ) . In an acute ( 8-week ) SEROQUEL XR trial in children and adolescents ( 10 to 17 years of age ) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of SEROQUEL XR ( incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice that for placebo ) were dizziness 7% , diarrhea 5% , fatigue 5% , and nausea 5% . Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of ≥ 2% among Quetiapine Treated Patients in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Schizophrenia ( Adolescents, 13 to 17 years old ) The following findings were based on a 6-week placebo-controlled trial in which quetiapine was administered in either doses of 400 or 800 mg/day. Table 13 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during therapy ( up to 6 weeks ) of schizophrenia in 2% or more of patients treated with quetiapine ( doses of 400 or 800 mg/day ) where the incidence in patients treated with quetiapine was at least twice the incidence in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions that were potentially dose-related with higher frequency in the 800 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included dizziness ( 8% vs. 15% ) , dry mouth ( 4% vs. 10% ) , and tachycardia ( 6% vs. 11% ) .

In a short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trial in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania ( 3-week duration ) , the aggregated incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 3.6% ( 7/193 ) or quetiapine and 1.1% ( 1/90 ) for placebo. Table 15 presents a listing of patients with adverse reactions potentially associated with extrapyramidal symptoms in the short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trial in adolescent patients with schizophrenia ( 6-week duration ) . In Tables 15 to 16, dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, and muscle rigidity; parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity and tremor; akathisia included akathisia only; dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis; and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness and extrapyramidal disorder.

Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ] Transaminase Elevations Asymptomatic, transient, and reversible elevations in serum transaminases ( primarily ALT ) have been reported. In schizophrenia trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of >3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled trials were approximately 6% ( 29/483 ) for quetiapine compared to 1% ( 3/194 ) for placebo. In acute bipolar mania trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of >3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3- to 12-week placebo-controlled trials were approximately 1% for both quetiapine ( 3/560 ) and placebo ( 3/294 ) . These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 3 weeks of drug treatment and promptly returned to pre-study levels with ongoing treatment with quetiapine. In bipolar depression trials, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of >3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in two 8-week placebo-controlled trials was 1% ( 5/698 ) for quetiapine and 2% ( 6/347 ) for placebo. Adults: Decreased Hemoglobin Adults: In short-term placebo-controlled trials, decreases in hemoglobin to ≤13 g/dL males, ≤12 g/dL females on at least one occasion occurred in 8.3% ( 594/7.155 ) of quetiapine-treated patients compared to 6.2% ( 219/3.536 ) of patients treated with placebo. In a database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, decreases in hemoglobin to ≤13 g/dL males, ≤12 g/dL females on at least one occasion occurred in 11% ( 2.277/20.729 ) of quetiapine-treated patients. Interference with Urine Drug Screens There have been literature reports suggesting false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results for these drugs, and confirmation by alternative analytical technique ( e.g. , chromatographic methods ) should be considered. ECG Changes Between-group comparisons for pooled placebo-controlled trials revealed no statistically significant quetiapine/placebo differences in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially important changes in ECG parameters, including QT, QTc, and PR intervals. However, the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia were compared in four 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia revealing a 1% ( 4/399 ) incidence for quetiapine compared to 0.6% ( 1/156 ) incidence for placebo. In acute ( monotherapy ) bipolar mania trials the proportions of patients meeting the criteria for tachycardia was 0.5% ( 1/192 ) for quetiapine compared to 0% ( 0/178 ) incidence for placebo. In acute bipolar mania ( adjunct ) trials the proportions of patients meeting the same criteria was 0.6% ( 1/166 ) for quetiapine compared to 0% ( 0/171 ) incidence for placebo. In bipolar depression trials, no patients had heart rate increases to >120 beats per minute. Quetiapine use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute among placebo patients. This slight tendency to tachycardia in adults may be related to quetiapine’s potential for inducing orthostatic changes Adults: [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] In the acute ( 6-week ) schizophrenia trial in adolescents, increases in heart rate ( >110 bpm ) occurred in 5.2% ( 3/73 ) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 8.5% ( 5/74 ) of patients receiving quetiapine 800 mg compared to 0% ( 0/75 ) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.8 bpm and 11.2 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 800 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 3.3 bpm in the placebo group Children and Adolescents: [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] . In the acute ( 3-week ) bipolar mania trial in children and adolescents, increases in heart rate ( >110 bpm ) occurred in 1.1% ( 1/89 ) of patients receiving quetiapine 400 mg and 4.7% ( 4/85 ) of patients receiving quetiapine 600 mg compared to 0% ( 0/98 ) of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 12.8 bpm and 13.4 bpm for quetiapine 400 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 1.7 bpm in the placebo group [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] In an acute ( 8-week ) SEROQUEL XR trial in children and adolescents ( 10 to 17 years of age ) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, increases in heart rate ( >110 bpm 10 to 12 years and 13 to 17 years ) occurred in 0% of patients receiving SEROQUEL XR and 1.2% of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.4 bpm for SEROQUEL XR, compared to 0.3 bpm in the placebo group [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval of quetiapine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction which were temporally related to quetiapine therapy include anaphylactic reaction, cardiomyopathy, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , hyponatremia, myocarditis, nocturnal enuresis, pancreatitis, retrograde amnesia, rhabdomyolysis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) , Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , decreased platelet count, serious liver reactions ( including hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure ) , agranulocytosis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, colon ischemia, urinary retention, sleep apnea, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) , confusional state, cutaneous vasculitis, and fecal incontinence."
