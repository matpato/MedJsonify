    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Terconazole Vaginal Suppositories, 80 mg are indicated for the local treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (moniliasis). As this product is effective only for vulvovaginitis caused by the genus Candida, the diagnosis should be confirmed by KOH smears and/or cultures.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Patients known to be hypersensitive to terconazole or to any of the components of the suppositories.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Anaphylaxis and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported during terconazole therapy. Terconazole Vaginal Suppositories, 80 mg therapy should be discontinued if anaphylaxis or toxic epidermal necrolysis develops.PRECAUTIONS General - For vulvovaginal use only. Terconazole Vaginal Suppositories, 80 mg is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. The base contained in the suppository formulation may interact with certain rubber or latex products, such as those used in vaginal contraceptive diaphragms or latex condoms; therefore concurrent use is not recommended. Laboratory Tests - If there is a lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions - The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. The levels of estradiol and progesterone did not differ significantly when 0.8% terconazole vaginal cream was administered to healthy female volunteers established on a low dose oral contraceptive. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis - Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity - Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility - No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C - There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (25x the recommended intravaginal human dose of the suppository formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20-40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 17 times the mean peak plasma level (0.010 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus. Nursing Mothers - It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use - Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Geriatric Use - Clinical studies of terconazole vaginal suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, 284 patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppositories. Based on comparative analyses with placebo (295 patients), the adverse experiences considered adverse reactions most likely related to terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppositories were headache (30.3% vs. 20.7% with placebo) and pain of the female genitalia (4.2% vs. 0.7% with placebo). Adverse reactions that have also been reported but were not statistically significantly different from placebo were burning (15.2% vs. 11.2% with placebo) and body pain (3.9% vs. 1.7% with placebo). Fever (2.8% vs. 1.4% with placebo) and chills (1.8% vs. 0.7% with placebo) have also been reported. The adverse drug experience on terconazole most frequently causing discontinuation was burning (2.5% vs. 1.4% with placebo) and pruritus (1.8% vs. 1.4% with placebo). Post-marketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been first identified during post-marketing experience with Terconazole Vaginal Suppositories, 80 mg. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General: Asthenia, Influenza-Like Illness consisting of multiple listed reactions including fever and chills, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise Immune: Hypersensitivity, Anaphylaxis, Face Edema Nervous: Dizziness Respiratory: Bronchospasm Skin: Rash, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, Urticaria"
