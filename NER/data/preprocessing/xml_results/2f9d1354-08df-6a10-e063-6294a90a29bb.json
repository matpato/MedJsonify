  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNING . 1. Cardiovascular Disorders An increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , stroke, and myocardial infarction has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. Risk factors for arterial vascular disease ( for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity ) and/or venous thromboembolism ( for example, personal history or family history of venous thromboembolism [VTE] , obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus ) should be managed appropriately. a. Stroke In the Women’s Health Initiative ( WHI ) estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 years to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0.625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2.5 mg ) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 33 versus 25 per 10.000 women-years ) . The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. ( See . ) Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. CLINICAL STUDIES b. Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) events ( defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] , silent MI, or CHD death ) reported in women receiving daily CE ( 0.625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2.5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 41 versus 34 per 10.000 women-years ) . An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1 and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5. ( See . ) CLINICAL STUDIES In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease ( n = 2.763, average age 66.7 years ) , in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study [HERS] ) , treatment with daily CE ( 0.625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2.5 mg ) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one ( 2.321 ) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open-label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. c. Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE ( DVT and pulmonary embolism [PE] ) was reported in women receiving daily CE ( 0.625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2.5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 35 versus 17 per 10.000 women-years ) . Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT ( 26 versus 13 per 10.000 women-years ) and PE ( 18 versus 8 per 10.000 women-years ) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted. ( See . ) Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately. CLINICAL STUDIES If feasible, estrogens with progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 2. Malignant Neoplasms a. Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0.625 mg ) - alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen‑alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average of follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk ( RR ) 0.80] compared to placebo ( see ) . In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10.000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10.000 women-years, for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10.000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE ( 0.625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2.5 mg ) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups. ( See CLINICAL STUDIES CLINICAL STUDIES . ) Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to > 10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. However, these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. b. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 times to 12 times greater than in nonusers, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15-fold to 24-fold for 5 years to 10 years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 years to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. c. Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 ( 95 percent nCI, 0.77 to 3.24 ) . The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10.000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-only products, in particular for 5 or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association. 3. Probable Dementia In the estrogen plus progestin Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study ( WHIMS ) , an ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4.532 postmenopausal women 65 years to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0.625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2.5 mg ) or placebo. In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, after an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for estrogen plus progestin versus placebo was 2.05 ( 95 percent CI, 1.21 to 3.48 ) . The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10.000 women-years. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. ( See and CLINICAL STUDIES . ) PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use 4. Vision Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogen. Discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or if there is a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia or migraine. If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be permanently discontinued.PRECAUTIONS A. General 1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared with estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 2. Fluid Retention Progesterone may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation. 3. Dizziness and Drowsiness Progesterone capsules may cause transient dizziness and drowsiness and should be used with caution when driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery. Progesterone capsules should be taken as a single daily dose at bedtime. B. Patient Information General: This product contains peanut oil and should not be used if you are allergic to peanuts. Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe progesterone capsules. C. Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory results may be altered by the use of estrogen plus progestin therapy: Increased sulfobromophthalein retention and other hepatic function tests. Coagulation tests: increase in prothrombin factors VII, VIII, IX and X. Pregnanediol determination. Thyroid function: increase in PBI, and butanol extractable protein bound iodine and decrease in T3 uptake values. D. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Progesterone has not been tested for carcinogenicity in animals by the oral route of administration. When implanted into female mice, progesterone produced mammary carcinomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and endometrial stromal sarcomas. In dogs, long-term intramuscular injections produced nodular hyperplasia and benign and malignant mammary tumors. Subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of progesterone decreased the latency period and increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats previously treated with a chemical carcinogen. Progesterone did not show evidence of genotoxicity in in vitro studies for point mutations or for chromosomal damage. In vivo studies for chromosome damage have yielded positive results in mice at oral doses of 1.000 mg/kg and 2.000 mg/kg. Exogenously administered progesterone has been shown to inhibit ovulation in a number of species and it is expected that high doses given for an extended duration would impair fertility until the cessation of treatment. E. Pregnancy Progesterone capsules should not be used during pregnancy. ( See . ) CONTRAINDICATIONS Reproductive studies have been performed in mice at doses up to 9 times the human oral dose, in rats at doses up to 44 times the human oral dose, in rabbits at a dose of 10 mcg/day delivered locally within the uterus by an implanted device, in guinea pigs at doses of approximately one-half the human oral dose and in rhesus monkeys at doses approximately the human dose, all based on body surface area, and have revealed little or no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to progesterone. F. Nursing Women Detectable amounts of progestin have been identified in the milk of nursing women receiving progestins. Caution should be exercised when progesterone capsules are administered to a nursing woman. G. Pediatric Use Progesterone capsules are not indicated in children. Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population. H. Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing progesterone capsules to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to progesterone capsules. The Women’s Health Initiative Study In the Women’s Health Initiative ( WHI ) estrogen plus progestin substudy ( daily CE [0.625 mg] plus MPA [2.5 mg] versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age. ( See and CLINICAL STUDIES WARNINGS , Cardiovascular Disorders and Malignant Neoplasms . ) The Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study In the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study ( WHIMS ) of postmenopausal women 65 years to 79 years of age, there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in the estrogen plus progestin ancillary study when compared to placebo.

  "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS See and BOXED WARNING , WARNINGS PRECAUTIONS. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effects of progesterone capsules on the endometrium was studied in a total of 875 postmenopausal women. Table 6 lists adverse reactions greater than or equal to 2 percent of women who received cyclic progesterone capsules 200 mg daily ( 12 days per calendar month cycle ) with 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens or placebo.
