  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS See Boxed WARNINGS Life-threatening respiratory depression in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients : Monitor closely, particularly during initiation of therapy. ( 5.4 ) Activities requiring mental alertness : Avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring mental alertness such as driving or operating machinery. ( 5.6 ) Risks of use in patients with head injury, impaired consciousness, increased intracranial pressure, or brain tumors : Avoid use. May increase intracranial pressure and obscure the clinical course of head injuries. ( 5.10 ) Seizures in patients with seizure disorders: Monitor during therapy. ( 5.11 ) Severe hypotension : Monitor during initiation of therapy. Avoid use in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.12 ) Adrenal insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [ see ] , which can lead to overdose and death [ Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) see ] . Overdosage ( 10 ) Reserve Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Suspension for use in adult patients for whom the benefits of cough suppression are expected to outweigh the risks, and in whom an adequate assessment of the etiology of the cough has been made. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Suspension, prescribe Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended-Release Suspension for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals, monitor all patients regularly for the development of addiction or abuse, and refill only after reevaluation of the need for continued treatment. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse ( including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction ) or mental illness ( e.g. , major depression ) . Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on the proper disposal of unused drug [ see ] . Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Hydrocodone produces dose-related respiratory depression by directly acting on the brain stem respiratory center that controls respiratory rhythm and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression includes discontinuation of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists ( e.g. naloxone ) , depending on the patient’s clinical status [ see ] . Carbon dioxide ( CO Overdosage ( 10 ) 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy, when Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is used concomitantly with other drugs that may cause respiratory depression [ see ] , in patients with chronic pulmonary disease or decreased respiratory reserve, and in patients with altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance ( e.g. elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients ) [ Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) see ] . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is essential [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ] . Monitor patients closely, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy or when used in patients at higher risk. ) Overdose of hydrocodone in adults has been associated with fatal respiratory depression, and the use of hydrocodone in children younger than 6 years of age has been associated with fatal respiratory depression when used as recommended. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death. 5.3 Risks of Use in Pediatric Populations Children are particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of hydrocodone [ see ] . Because of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression and death, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age [ Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) see ] . Contraindications ( 4 ) Use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in children also exposes them to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [ see ] , which can lead to overdose and death [ Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) , ] . Because the benefits of symptomatic treatment of cough associated with allergies or thecommon cold do not outweigh the risks of use of hydrocodone in pediatric patients, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirexis not indicated for use in patients younger than 18 years of age [ Overdosage ( 10 ) see ] . Indications ( 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) 5.4 Risks of Use in Other At-Risk Populations Unresponsive Cough The dosage of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex should not be increased if cough fails to respond; an unresponsive cough should be reevaluated in 5 days or sooner for possible underlying pathology, such as foreign body or lower respiratory tract disease [ see ] . Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) Asthma and Other Pulmonary Disease The use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated [ see ] . Contraindications ( 4 ) Opioid analgesics and antitussives, including hydrocodone, one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, should not be used in patients with acute febrile illness associated with productive cough or in patients with chronic respiratory disease where interference with ability to clear the tracheobronchial tree of secretions would have a deleterious effect on the patient’s respiratory function. Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or corpulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex [ see ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [ see ] . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) Because of the risk of respiratory depression, avoid the use of opioid antitussives, including Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in patients with compromised respiratory function, patients at risk of respiratory failure, and in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. If Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is prescribed, monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex and when Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [ see ] . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) 5.5 Risk of Accidental Overdose and Death due to Medication Errors Dosing errors can result in accidental overdose and death. To reduce the risk of overdose and respiratory depression, ensure that the dose of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is communicated clearly and dispensed accurately [ see ] . Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) Advise patients to always use an accurate milliliter measuring device when measuring and administering Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Inform patients that household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and such use could lead to overdosage and serious adverse reactions [ see ] . For prescriptions where a measuring device is not provided, a pharmacist can provide an appropriate calibrated measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose. Overdosage ( 10 ) 5.6 Activities Requiring Mental Alertness: Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine, two of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, may produce marked drowsiness and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. Advise patients to avoid engaging in hazardous tasks requiring mental alertness and motor coordination after ingestion of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Avoid concurrent use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants because additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [ see ] . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) 5.7 Risks from Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3 A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Concomitant use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex with a CYP3 A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics ( e.g. , erythromycin ) , azole-antifungal agents ( e.g. , ketoconazole ) , and protease inhibitors ( e.g. , ritonavir ) , may increase plasma concentrations of hydrocodone and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [ see ] , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3 A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex-treated patients may increase hydrocodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) Concomitant use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex with CYP3 A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3 A4 inhibitor could decrease hydrocodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone. Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in patients who are taking a CYP3 A4 inhibitor or inducer. If concomitant use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex with a CYP3 A4 inhibitor or inducer is necessary, monitor patients for signs and symptoms that may reflect opioid toxicity and opioid withdrawal [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , ] . 7.3 ) 5.8 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids, including Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, with benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, avoid use of opioid cough medications in patients taking benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.5 ) ] . Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of similar pharmacologic properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with concomitant use of opioid cough medications and benzodiazepines, other CNS depressants, or alcohol. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation if Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is used with benzodiazepines, alcohol, or other CNS depressants [ see ] . Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) Patients must not consume alcoholic beverages, or prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol, while on Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex therapy. The co-ingestion of alcohol with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may result in increased plasma levels and a potentially fatal overdose of hydrocodone [ see ] . Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) 5.9 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [ see ] . The use of hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions. Contraindications ( 4 ) The concurrent use of anticholinergics with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may produce paralytic ileus [ see ] . Drug Interactions ( 7.10 ) The hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may result in constipation or obstructive bowel disease, especially in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders. Use with caution in patients with underlying intestinal motility disorders. The hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, resulting in an increase in biliary tract pressure. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase [ see ] . Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis for worsening symptoms. Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 ) 5.10 Risks of Use in Patients with Head Injury, Impaired Consciousness, Increased Intracranial Pressure, or Brain Tumors Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure. In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention ( e.g. , those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors ) , Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Furthermore, opioids produce adverse reactions that may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. 5.11 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex therapy. 5.12 Severe Hypotension Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs ( e.g. , phenothiazines or general anesthetics ) [ see ] . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex. Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) In patients with circulatory shock, Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in patients with circulatory shock. 5.13 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex is not recommended for use in pregnant women. Prolonged use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) , ] . Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) 5.14 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.15 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Because opioid agonists may increase biliary tract pressure, with resultant increase in plasma amylase or lipase levels, determination of these enzyme levels may be unreliable for 24 hours after administration of a dose of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex.",
