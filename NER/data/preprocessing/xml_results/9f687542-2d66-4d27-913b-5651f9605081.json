    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ACULAR is indicated for the temporary relief of ocular itching due to seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. ACULAR is also indicated for the treatment of postoperative inflammation in patients who have undergone cataract extraction. ACULAR is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for: The temporary relief of ocular itching due to seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. ( 1 ) The treatment of inflammation following cataract surgery. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ACULAR solution is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the formulation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Delayed healing ( 5.1 ) Cross-sensitivity or hypersensitivity ( 5.2 ) Increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation ( 5.3 ) Corneal effects including keratitis ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Delayed Healing Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. 5.2 Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs. There have beenÂ reports of bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma associated with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution in patients who have either a known hypersensitivity to aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or a past medical history of asthma. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs. 5.3 Increased Bleeding Time With some NSAIDs, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery. It is recommended that ACULAR be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications, which may prolong bleeding time. 5.4 Corneal Effects Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs and should be closely monitored for corneal health. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events. 5.5 Risk of Contamination Avoid allowing the tip of the bottle to contact the eye or surrounding structures because this could cause the tip to become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions. 5. 6 Contact Lens Wear ACULAR should not be administered while wearing contact lenses.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Delayed Healing [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Cross-Sensitivity or Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Increased Bleeding Time [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Corneal Effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] The most frequent adverse reactions reported by up to 40% of patients participating in clinical trials have been transient stinging and burning on instillation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial s Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most frequent adverse reactions reported with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solutions have been transient stinging and burning on instillation. These reactionsÂ were reported by up to 40% of patients participating in clinical trials. Other adverse reactions occurring approximately 1% to 10% of the time during treatment withÂ ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solutions included allergic reactions (including eye swelling, hyperemia, and pruritus), corneal edema, iritis, ocular inflammation, ocular irritation, ocular pain, superficial keratitis, and superficial ocular infections. Other adverse reactions reported rarely with the use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solutions included: corneal infiltrates, corneal ulcer, eye dryness, headaches, and visual disturbance (blurry vision). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.5% in clinical practice. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the drug. Eye Disorders: corneal erosion, corneal perforation, corneal thinning, and epithelial breakdown. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: bronchospasm or exacerbation of asthma."
