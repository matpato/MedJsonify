Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with MOUNJARO [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.4 )] Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 ( 4 , 5.1 ) Known serious hypersensitivity to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in MOUNJARO ( 4 , 5.4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: Has been reported in clinical trials. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin: Concomitant use with an insulin secretagogue or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. Reducing dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin may be necessary. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis and angioedema) have been reported. Discontinue MOUNJARO if suspected and promptly seek medical advice. ( 5.4 ) Acute Kidney Injury: Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions. ( 5.5 ) Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. Has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease and is not recommended in these patients. ( 5.6 ) Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with a History of Diabetic Retinopathy: Has not been studied in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema. Monitor patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy for progression. ( 5.7 ) Acute Gallbladder Disease: Has occurred in clinical trials. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and clinical follow-up are indicated. ( 5.8 ) Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation: Has been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers of any planned surgeries or procedures. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors In both sexes of rats, tirzepatide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in a 2-year study at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( . It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. 13.1 )] MOUNJARO is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN 2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of MOUNJARO and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with MOUNJARO. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. In clinical studies, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 MOUNJARO-treated patients (0.23 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 comparator-treated patients (0.11 patients per 100 years of exposure). MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with a prior history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on MOUNJARO. After initiation of MOUNJARO, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue MOUNJARO and initiate appropriate management. 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Patients receiving MOUNJARO in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported in patients treated with MOUNJARO. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of MOUNJARO; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Do not use in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in MOUNJARO [see Contraindications ( . 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with MOUNJARO. 5.5 Acute Kidney Injury MOUNJARO has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions ( . These events may lead to dehydration, which if severe could cause acute kidney injury. 6.1 )] In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of MOUNJARO in patients with renal impairment reporting severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Use of MOUNJARO has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions . In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO (5 mg 1.3%, 10 mg 0.4%, 15 mg 1.2%) than placebo (0.9%). 6.1 ] MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients. 5.7 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with a History of Diabetic Retinopathy Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy. 5.8 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. In MOUNJARO placebo-controlled clinical trials, acute gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, biliary colic, and cholecystectomy) was reported by 0.6% of MOUNJARO-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated. 5.9 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. 12.2 )] Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking MOUNJARO, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing MOUNJARO could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking MOUNJARO.",

Pool of Seven Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse reactions were also evaluated in a larger pool of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus participating in seven controlled clinical trials which included two placebo-controlled trials (SURPASS-1 and -5), three trials of MOUNJARO in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, and/or SGLT2 Inhibitors (SURPASS-2, -3, -4) [see Clinical Studies ( and two additional trials conducted in Japan. In this pool, a total of 5119 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with MOUNJARO for a mean duration of 48.1 weeks. The mean age of patients was 58 years, 4% were 75 years or older and 58% were male. The population was 65% White, 24% Asian, 7% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 3% Black or African American; 38% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.

Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=235) % MOUNJARO 5 mg (N=237) % MOUNJARO 10 mg (N=240) % MOUNJARO 15 mg (N=241) % Nausea 4 12 15 18 Diarrhea 9 12 13 17 Decreased Appetite 1 5 10 11 Vomiting 2 5 5 9 Constipation 1 6 6 7 Dyspepsia 3 8 8 5 Abdominal Pain 4 6 5 5 In the pool of seven clinical trials, the types and frequency of common adverse reactions, not including hypoglycemia, were similar to those listed in Table 1 . Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO than placebo (placebo 20.4%, MOUNJARO 5 mg 37.1%, MOUNJARO 10 mg 39.6%, MOUNJARO 15 mg 43.6%). More patients receiving MOUNJARO 5 mg (3.0%), MOUNJARO 10 mg (5.4%), and MOUNJARO 15 mg (6.6%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (0.4%). The majority of reports of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occurred during dose escalation and decreased over time. The following gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently in MOUNJARO-treated patients than placebo-treated patients (frequencies listed, respectively, as: placebo; 5 mg; 10 mg; 15 mg): eructation (0.4%, 3.0%, 2.5%, 3.3%), flatulence (0%, 1.3%, 2.5%, 2.9%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (0.4%, 1.7%, 2.5%, 1.7%), abdominal distension (0.4%, 0.4%, 2.9%, 0.8%). Other Adverse Reactions Hypoglycemia Table 2 summarizes the incidence of hypoglycemic events in the placebo-controlled trials. Table 2: Hypoglycemia Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus * Reflects the study treatment period. Data include events occurring during 4 weeks of treatment-free safety follow up. Events after introduction of a new glucose-lowering treatment are excluded. ** Episodes requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.

In a clinical trial up to 104 weeks of treatment, when administered with a sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia (glucose level <54 mg/dL) occurred in 13.8%, 9.9%, and 12.8%, and severe hypoglycemia occurred in 0.5%, 0%, and 0.6% of patients treated with MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively. 14 )] Heart Rate Increase In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, treatment with MOUNJARO resulted in a mean increase in heart rate of 2 to 4 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute in placebo-treated patients. Episodes of sinus tachycardia, associated with a concomitant increase from baseline in heart rate of ≥15 beats per minute, also were reported in 4.3%, 4.6%, 5.9% and 10% of subjects treated with placebo, MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively. For patients enrolled in Japan, these episodes were reported in 7% (3/43), 7.1% (3/42), 9.3% (4/43), and 23% (10/43) of patients treated with placebo, MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively. The clinical relevance of heart rate increases is uncertain. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with MOUNJARO in the pool of placebo-controlled trials, sometimes severe (e.g., urticaria and eczema); hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 3.2% of MOUNJARO-treated patients compared to 1.7% of placebo-treated patients. In the pool of seven clinical trials , hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 106/2,570 (4.1%) of MOUNJARO-treated patients with anti-tirzepatide antibodies and in 73/2,455 (3.0%) of MOUNJARO-treated patients who did not develop anti-tirzepatide antibodies [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 )]. Injection Site Reactions In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, injection site reactions were reported in 3.2% of MOUNJARO-treated patients compared to 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. In the pool of seven clinical trials, injection site reactions occurred in 119/2,570 (4.6%) of MOUNJARO-treated patients with anti-tirzepatide antibodies and in 18/2,455 (0.7%) of MOUNJARO-treated patients who did not develop anti-tirzepatide antibodies [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.6 )]. Acute Gallbladder Disease In the pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials, acute gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, biliary colic and cholecystectomy) was reported by 0.6% of MOUNJARO-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. Dysesthesia In the pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials, dysesthesia was reported by 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.4% of patients treated with MOUNJARO 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, respectively. No events were reported by patients receiving placebo. Dysgeusia In the pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials, dysgeusia was reported by 0.1% of MOUNJARO-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Abnormalities Amylase and Lipase Increase In the pool of placebo-controlled clinical trials, treatment with MOUNJARO resulted in mean increases from baseline in serum pancreatic amylase concentrations of 33% to 38% and serum lipase concentrations of 31% to 42%. Placebo-treated patients had a mean increase from baseline in pancreatic amylase of 4% and no changes were observed in lipase. The clinical significance of elevations in lipase or amylase with MOUNJARO is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of MOUNJARO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity : anaphylaxis, angioedema Gastrointestinal : ileus Pulmonary : Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation."
