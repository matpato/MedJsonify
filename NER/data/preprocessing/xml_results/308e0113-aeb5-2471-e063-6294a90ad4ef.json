  "indications": "INDICATIONS REGIOCIT ( sodium chloride and sodium citrate ) solution is indicated for use as replacement solution for regional citrate anticoagulation ( RCA ) of the extracorporeal circuit in patients treated with continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) , particularly when systemic anticoagulation with heparin is contraindicated, e.g. , in patients with increased bleeding risks. REGIOCIT should be administered only under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of CRRT. Pediatrics Pediatrics ( <18 years of age ) : No data are available to Health Canada; therefore, Health Canada has not authorized an indication for pediatric use. Geriatrics Geriatrics ( > 65 years of age ) : Evidence from clinical studies and experience suggests that use in the geriatric population is not associated with differences in safety or effectiveness.",
  "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Contraindications for the use of REGIOCIT include: Severe liver failure Shock with muscle hypoperfusion Known hypersensitivity to any component of REGIOCIT Adverse Event Reporting Report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of this product. Healthcare facilities and prescribing health care providers or their designee receiving REGIOCIT will track all medication errors associated with the use of and all serious adverse events that are considered to be potentially attributable to REGIOCIT use and must report these to FDA using one of the following methods: Complete and submit a MedWatch form online ( www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm ) Complete and submit FDA Form 3500 ( health professional ) by fax ( 1-800-FDA-0178 ) ( this form can be found via link above ) . Call 1-800-FDA-1088 for questions. Submitted reports should state, “use of REGIOCIT was under an EUA” at the beginning of the question “Describe Event” for further analysis. Contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-866-888-2472 or global_pharmacovigilance_deerfield@baxter.com What is an EUA? The United States FDA has made REGIOCIT available to treat patients in an ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic under an emergency access mechanism called an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) . The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service ( HHS ) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. REGIOCIT made available under an EUA have not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that REGIOCIT may be effective for use as a replacement solution in adult patients treated with Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ( CRRT ) and requiring regional citrate anticoagulation ( RCA ) of the extracorporeal circuit in an ICU setting during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) pandemic, and that the known and potential benefits of REGIOCIT for such use outweigh the known and potential risks of REGIOCIT. This EUA for REGIOCIT is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of the products, unless terminated or revoked ( after which the products may no longer be needed ) . The EUA will end when the declaration is terminated or revoked or when there is a change in the approval status of the product such that an EUA is no longer needed.

  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 2.1 Hypocalcemia REGIOCIT solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation. Calcium reinfusion is required during use of REGIOCIT and blood calcium concentrations ( ionized and total ) must be monitored. 2.3 Hypomagnesemia REGIOCIT solution contains no magnesium. Use of the REGIOCIT solution may result in hypomagnesemia due to CRRT effluent losses. Magnesium levels must be monitored as infusion of magnesium may be necessary. 2.4 Hypoglycemia REGIOCIT solution contains no dextrose. Administration of REGIOCIT solution may lead to hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels must be monitored regularly. 2.5 Hypokalemia REGIOCIT solution contains no potassium. The serum potassium concentration must be monitored before and during CRRT. 2.6 Metabolic Alkalosis REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Metabolization of 1 mol of citrate generates 3 mol of bicarbonate. Additional sodium bicarbonate ( or buffer source ) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance. If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate/replacement flow rate ( when applicable ) or change the composition of the CRRT solution. 2.7 Metabolic Acidosis Metabolic acidosis may occur if metabolic clearance of citrate by the liver or skeletal muscle is impaired. If citrate accumulation develops and/or metabolic acidosis develops or worsens during therapy with REGIOCIT solution, the infusion rate may need to be decreased or its administration stopped. 2.8 Use in Patients with Mild to Moderate Hepatic Impairment Metabolism of citrate ( to bicarbonate ) may be impaired in patients with hepatic impairment, resulting in accumulation of citrate. If REGIOCIT solution is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid–base imbalance. 2.9 Hypoosmolarity/Hypotonicity REGIOCIT solution is hypoosmolar/hypotonic relative to standard CRRT replacement fluids and should be used with caution in patients with traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, or increased intracranial pressure.",
