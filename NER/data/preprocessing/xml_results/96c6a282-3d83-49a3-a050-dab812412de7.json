Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1     Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis ILD/pneumonitis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 4.8% of patients treated with TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1, with 1.9% of patients experiencing Grade 3 ILD/pneumonitis and one patient experiencing death (0.3%). Nine patients (2.4%) discontinued TABRECTA due to ILD/pneumonitis. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher ILD/pneumonitis was 1.8 months (range: 0.2 months to 1.7 years). Monitor for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold TABRECTA in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.2     Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 15% of patients treated with TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1. Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT/AST occurred in 7% of patients. Three patients (0.8%) discontinued TABRECTA due to increased ALT/AST. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher increased ALT/AST was 1.8 months (range: 0.5 to 46.4 months). Monitor liver function tests (including ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of TABRECTA, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop increased transaminases or bilirubin. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TABRECTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.3     Pancreatic Toxicity Elevations in amylase and lipase levels occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Increased amylase/lipase occurred in 14% of patients treated with TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1. Grade 3 and 4 increased amylase/lipase occurred in 7% and 1.9% of patients, respectively. Three patients (0.8%) discontinued TABRECTA due to increased amylase/lipase. The median time-to-onset of Grade 3 or higher increased amylase/lipase was 2 months (range: 0.03 to 31.1 months). Pancreatitis (Grade 3) occurred in one patient (0.3%); TABRECTA was permanently discontinued for this event. Monitor amylase and lipase at baseline and regularly during treatment with TABRECTA. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, temporarily withhold, dose reduce, or permanently discontinue TABRECTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.4     Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions occurred in patients treated with TABRECTA in clinical trials other than GEOMETRY mono-1 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity included pyrexia, chills, pruritus, rash, decreased blood pressure, nausea and vomiting. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, temporarily withhold or permanently discontinue TABRECTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.5     Risk of Photosensitivity Based on findings from animal studies, there is a potential risk of photosensitivity reactions with TABRECTA [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)] . In GEOMETRY mono-1, it was recommended that patients use precautionary measures against ultraviolet exposure such as use of sunscreen or protective clothing during treatment with TABRECTA. Advise patients to limit direct ultraviolet exposure during treatment with TABRECTA. 5.6     Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and  its mechanism of action, TABRECTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of capmatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations at exposures less than the human exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the 400 mg twice daily clinical dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TABRECTA and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] .",

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1     Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of TABRECTA was evaluated in GEOMETRY mono-1 [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Patients received TABRECTA 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (N = 373). Among patients who received TABRECTA, 37% were exposed for at least 6 months and 22% were exposed for at least one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 53% of patients who received TABRECTA. Serious adverse reactions in ≥ 2% of patients included dyspnea (7%), pneumonia (7%), pleural effusion (4.3%), musculoskeletal pain (3.8%), general physical health deterioration (2.9%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.7%), edema (2.4%), and vomiting (2.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.5% of patients who received TABRECTA, including pneumonitis (0.3%) and death, not otherwise specified (0.3%). Permanent discontinuation of TABRECTA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 17% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 1%) leading to permanent discontinuation of TABRECTA were ILD/pneumonitis (2.4%), edema (2.4%), fatigue (1.3%), and pneumonia (1.1%). Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 57% of patients who received TABRECTA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in > 2% of patients who received TABRECTA included edema, increased blood creatinine, nausea, increased lipase, vomiting, increased ALT, dyspnea, pneumonia, fatigue, increased amylase, increased AST, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, and increased blood bilirubin. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 26% of patients who received TABRECTA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in > 2% of patients who received TABRECTA included edema, increased ALT and increased blood creatinine. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) in patients who received TABRECTA were edema, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, cough, and decreased appetite.
