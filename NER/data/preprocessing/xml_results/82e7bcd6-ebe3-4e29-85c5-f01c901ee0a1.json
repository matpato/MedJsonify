    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial ischemia/infarction and Prinzmetal's angina: Perform cardiac evaluation in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias: Discontinue ZEMBRACE SymTouch if occurs. ( 5.2 ) Chest/throat/neck/jaw pain, tightness, pressure, or heaviness: Generally, not associated with myocardial ischemia; evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients at high risk. ( 5.3 ) Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke: Discontinue ZEMBRACE SymTouch if occurs. ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal ischemia and reactions, peripheral vasospastic reactions: Discontinue ZEMBRACE SymTouch if occurs. ( 5.5 ) Medication overuse headache: Detoxification may be necessary. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin syndrome: Discontinue ZEMBRACE SymTouch if occurs. ( 5.7 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with epilepsy or a lowered seizure threshold. ( 5.10 ) 5.1\tMyocardial Ischemia, Myocardial Infarction, and Prinzmetal's Angina The use of ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. 5-HT 1 agonists, including ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection, may cause coronary artery vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), even in patients without a history of CAD. Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan-naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, strong family history of CAD) prior to receiving ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection. If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm, ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated. For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, consider administering the first dose of ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately following ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection. For such patients, consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long-term users of ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection. 5.2\tArrhythmias Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT 1 agonists. Discontinue ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection if these disturbances occur. ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders. 5.3\tChest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal's variant angina. 5.4\tCerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT 1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, TIA). Discontinue ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or in patients who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA. 5.5\tOther Vasospasm Reactions ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non-coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5-HT 1 agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional ZEMBRACE SymTouch injections. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT 1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT 1 agonists have not been clearly established. 5.6\tMedication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. 5.7\tSerotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Drug Interactions (7.4) ] 5.8\tIncrease in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT 1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with ZEMBRACE SymTouch. ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.9\tHypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life-threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. 5.10\tSeizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures. There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. ZEMBRACE SymTouch injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.",

Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials with Sumatriptan Injection Migraine Headache: Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 US placebo-controlled clinical trials in migraine subjects (Studies 2 and 3), following either a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo. Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1.

There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions. Adverse Reactions in a Study with ZEMBRACE SymTouch The most common adverse reactions in a placebo-controlled trial with ZEMBRACE SymTouch were injection site reactions (including injection site bruising, erythema, hemorrhage, induration, irritation, pain, paresthesia, pruritis, swelling, and urticaria), occurring in 30% of ZEMBRACE SymTouch-treated patients compared to 13% of placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions with ZEMRACE SymTouch are expected to be similar to those observed with sumatriptan injection. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sumatriptan tablets, sumatriptan nasal spray, and sumatriptan injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Hypotension, palpitations Neurological Dystonia, tremor"
