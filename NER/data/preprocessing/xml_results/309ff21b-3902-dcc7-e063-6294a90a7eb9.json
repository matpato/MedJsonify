    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Limitation of Use: Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension should not be used as an emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia because of its delayed onset of action . [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is indicated for the treatment of hyperkalemia (1) . Limitation of Use: Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension should not be used as an emergency treatment for life-threatening hyperkalemia because of its delayed onset of action (1) .",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: •Hypersensitivity to polystyrene sulfonate resins •Obstructive bowel disease •Neonates with reduced gut motility •Hypersensitivity to polystyrene sulfonate resins (4)•Obstructive bowel disease (4)•Neonates with reduced gut motility (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS •Intestinal Necrosis: cases of intestinal necrosis and other serious gastrointestinal events have been reported (5.1). •Electrolyte Disturbances: Severe hypokalemia can occur. (5.2). •Fluid overload in patient sensitive to high sodium intake: Monitor patients who are sensitive to sodium intake for signs of fluid overload. (5.3). •Risk of aspiration: Acute bronchitis or bronchopneumonia caused by inhalation of sodium polystyrene sulfonate particles has been reported. (5.4) 5.1 Intestinal Necrosis Cases of intestinal necrosis, some fatal, and other serious gastrointestinal adverse events (bleeding, ischemic colitis, perforation) have been reported in association with Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension use. The majority of these cases reported the concomitant use of sorbitol. Risk factors for gastrointestinal adverse events were present in many of the cases including prematurity, history of intestinal disease or surgery, hypovolemia, and renal insufficiency and failure. Concomitant administration of sorbitol is not recommended. •Use only in patients who have normal bowel function. Avoid use in patients who have not had a bowel movement post-surgery. •Avoid use in patients who are at risk for developing constipation or impaction (including those with history of impaction, chronic constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, vascular intestinal atherosclerosis, previous bowel resection, or bowel obstruction). Discontinue use in patients who develop constipation. 5.2 Electrolyte Disturbances Monitor serum potassium during therapy because severe hypokalemia may occur. Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension is not totally selective for potassium, and small amounts of other cations such as magnesium and calcium can also be lost during treatment. Monitor calcium and magnesium in patients receiving Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension. 5.3 Fluid Overload in Patients Sensitive to High Sodium Intake Each 15 g dose of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension contains 1500 mg (60 mEq) of sodium. Monitor patients who are sensitive to sodium intake (heart failure, hypertension, edema) for signs of fluid overload. Adjustment of other sources of sodium may be required. 5.4 Risk of Aspiration Cases of acute bronchitis or bronchopneumonia caused by inhalation of sodium polystyrene sulfonate particles have been reported. Patients with impaired gag reflex, altered level of consciousness, or patients prone to regurgitation may be at increased risk. Administer Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension with the patient in an upright position. 5.5 Binding to Other Orally Administered Medications Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension may bind orally administered medications, which could decrease their gastrointestinal absorption and lead to reduced efficacy. Administer other oral medications at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension. Patients with gastroparesis may require a 6 hour separation. [SEE DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1) and DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Intestinal Necrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Electrolyte Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) ] Aspiration [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate Powder, for Suspension. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, fecal impaction, gastrointestinal concretions (bezoars), ischemic colitis, nausea, ulcerations, vomiting, gastric irritation, intestinal obstruction (due to concentration of aluminium hydroxide) Metabolic: systemic alkalosis Adverse reactions reported include: anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, fecal impaction, gastrointestinal concretions (bezoars), ischemic colitis, nausea, vomiting (6) .
