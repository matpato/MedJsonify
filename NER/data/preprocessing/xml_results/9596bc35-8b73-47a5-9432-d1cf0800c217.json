    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, arrhythmia, seizures, and renal impairment : Encourage adequate hydration, assess concurrent medications, and consider laboratory assessments prior to and after use. ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 7.1 ) Use in patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution, ensure adequate hydration, and consider testing. ( 4 , 5.3 , 7.1 ) Syncope : Resulted in serious outcomes including falls, head injuries, and fractures; encourage adequate hydration. ( 5.5 ) Mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease. ( 5.6 ) Suspected GI obstruction or perforation : Rule out diagnosis before administration. ( 4 , 5.7 ) Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration. ( 5.8 ) 5.1\tSerious Fluid and Electrolyte Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking CLENPIQ, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Approximately 20% of patients in both arms (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid, or 2 L of PEG + E plus two × 5-mg bisacodyl tablets) of clinical trials of another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product had orthostatic changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate on the day of colonoscopy and up to seven days post colonoscopy. In a single study of patients 9 to 16 years of age, approximately 20% of patients who received another oral product of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid had orthostatic changes (changes in blood pressure and/or heart rate) compared with approximately 7% of those who received the comparator (PEG) [see . These changes occurred up to five days post colonoscopy. Clinical Studies (14) ] Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse reactions including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, renal impairment, and syncope [see . Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with CLENPIQ. Advise patients to consume a variety of clear liquids (e.g., balanced electrolyte solution), and not only water after each dose of CLENPIQ. In addition, use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients who have conditions or who are using medications that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or that may increase the risk of seizure, arrhythmia, and renal impairment Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] 5.2\tSeizures There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness with the use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.3\tUse in Patients with Renal Impairment CLENPIQ is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), accumulation of  magnesium in plasma may occur. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function (such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [see . These patients may be at increased risk for renal injury. Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Consider performing baseline and post-colonoscopy laboratory tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) in these patients. Drug Interactions (7.1) ] 5.4\tCardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing CLENPIQ for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias. 5.5  Syncope Syncope has been reported with CLENPIQ in the postmarketing setting. Some cases were serious events that included falls with associated head injuries or fractures requiring hospitalization. In some cases, electrolyte abnormalities were also present (e.g., hyponatremia and hypokalemia). Cases have been reported after one or two  CLENPIQ doses and many of these cases occurred within 12 hours of dosing. Patients should be aware of the risk of syncope during treatment and adequately hydrate before, during, and after the use of CLENPIQ. Advise patients to consume a variety of clear liquids (e.g., balanced electrolyte solution), not only water after each dose of CLENPIQ and to get up gradually from a lying or sitting position [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 5.6\tColonic Mucosal Ulceration, Ischemic Colitis, and Ulcerative Colitis Osmotic laxatives may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization. Concurrent use of additional stimulant laxatives with CLENPIQ may increase this risk. Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.7\tUse in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering CLENPIQ [see . Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis. Contraindications (4) ] 5.8\tAspiration Patients with impaired gag reflex are at risk for regurgitation or aspiration during the administration of CLENPIQ. Observe these patients during the administration of CLENPIQ.",

Adults Clinical Study of CLENPIQ - Study 1 Table 1 displays the most common adverse reactions in a randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, non-inferiority trial of CLENPIQ for colon cleansing in adults (Study 1). CLENPIQ was compared to another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product, both administered according to the Split-Dose dosage regimen [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Observed in at Least 2% of Patients Undergoing Colon Cleansing in Study 1 Adverse Reaction Split-Dose Regimen CLENPIQ (N=448) % Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid Powder for reconstitution (N=453) % Nausea 3 3 Headache 3 3 Hypermagnesemia Magnesium levels returned to normal within one week after colonoscopy in all patients in the CLENPIQ group. 2 5 Abdominal pain Abdominal pain included reports of abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, and abdominal pain lower. 2 2 Dehydration or dizziness 2 2 Clinical Study of Another Sodium Picosulfate, Magnesium Oxide and Anhydrous Citric Acid Product - Study 2 In a randomized, multicenter, investigator-blinded, active-controlled clinical trial for colon cleansing in adults, another oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product was compared with a regimen of two liters (2 L) of polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution (PEG + E) and two 5-mg bisacodyl tablets (Study 2). In this study the protocol specified that abdominal bloating, distention, pain/cramping, and watery diarrhea, which are known to occur in response to bowel preparation, were documented as adverse events only if they required medical intervention (such as a change in study drug or led to discontinuation, therapeutic or diagnostic procedures, met the criteria for serious adverse event) or showed clinically significant worsening during the study that was not in the frame of the usual clinical course, as determined by the investigator. The most common adverse reactions in Study 2 are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions abdominal bloating, distention, pain/cramping, and watery diarrhea not requiring an intervention were not collected Observed in at Least 1% of Patients Undergoing Colon Cleansing in Study 2 Adverse Reaction Split-Dose Regimen Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid (N=305) % 2 L PEG + E 2 L PEG + E = two liters polyethylene glycol plus electrolytes solution with 2 × 5-mg bisacodyl tablets (N=298) % Nausea 3 4 Headache 2 2 Vomiting 1 3 Electrolyte Abnormalities In Study 1, rates of abnormal electrolyte shifts were generally similar between CLENPIQ and another sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid product (Table 3). In general, these shifts were transient and not clinically significant. In Study 2, sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid was in general associated with numerically higher rates of abnormal electrolyte shifts on the day of colonoscopy compared to the control regimen (Table 3). These shifts were transient in nature and numerically similar between treatment arms at the Day 28 visit.

Electrolytes abnormalities were observed in pediatric patients similar to those seen in adults. Three patients had abnormally low glucose levels (40 to 47 mg/dL). Two patients received sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid and one received the comparator (PEG). The abnormal values occurred at the colonoscopy visit for one patient (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid) and at the 5-day follow up visit for the other two patients (sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid and PEG). All three patients were asymptomatic. Clinical Studies (14) ] 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of oral sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity :  rash, urticaria, and purpura Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, proctalgia, vomiting, reversible aphthoid ileal ulcers, and ischemic colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Neurologic: generalized tonic-clonic seizures with and without hyponatremia in epileptic patients, and syncope [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5) ]"
