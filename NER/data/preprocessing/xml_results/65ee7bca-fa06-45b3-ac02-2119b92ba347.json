  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Pioglitazone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings [see . Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] Important Limitations of Use Pioglitazone tablets exert its antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin. Pioglitazone tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, as it would not be effective in these settings. Use caution in patients with liver disease [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione and an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) gamma indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings. ( 1, 14 ) Important Limitations of Use: • Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis. ( 1 )",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Initiation in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure [see Boxed Warning ] . • Use in patients with known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone or any other component of pioglitazone tablets. • Initiation in patients with established New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III or IV heart failure [see . Boxed Warning ] ( 4 ) • Use in patients with known hypersensitivity to pioglitazone or any other component of pioglitazone tablets. ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure. Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.1 ) • Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. ( 5.2 ) • Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt pioglitazone and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart pioglitazone if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) • Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer. Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer. Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. ( 5.4 ) • Edema: Dose-related edema may occur. ( 5.5 ) • Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients. Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health. ( 5.6 ) • Macular edema: Postmarketing reports. Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes. ( 5.7 ) • Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone must be considered [see , Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 ) and . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.2 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications ( particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas ) may be at risk for hypoglycemia. A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel ( serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] , aspartate aminotransferase [AST] , alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin ) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone should be initiated with caution. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests ( ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range ) , pioglitazone treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Pioglitazone should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on pioglitazone. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with pioglitazone can be used with caution. 5.4 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 ( 0.54% ) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 ( 0.19% ) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 ( 0.23% ) cases on pioglitazone and two ( 0.08% ) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo ( HR =1; [95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72] ) . Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ] . Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to pioglitazone vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with pioglitazone, while others did. A large prospective 10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to pioglitazone, compared to those never exposed to pioglitazone ( HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.89 to 1.26] ) . A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer ( HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.22 to 2.19] ) . Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to pioglitazone and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10-year observational study in the U.S. , but were in others. Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data. Pioglitazone may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors. There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors. Consequently, pioglitazone should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with pioglitazone should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer. 5.5 Edema In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related [see . In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] Pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients with edema. Because thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure. Patients treated with pioglitazone should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure [see . Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] 5.6 Fractures In PROactive ( the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events ) , 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone ( N=2605 ) , force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo ( N=2633 ) in addition to standard of care. During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% ( 44/870 ) for pioglitazone versus 2.5% ( 23/905 ) for placebo. This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study. The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb. No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7% ) versus placebo ( 2.1% ) . The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with pioglitazone and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care. 5.7 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination. Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed. Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione. Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care. Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.8 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone.",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: • Congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] • Edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] • Fractures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥5% ) are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, sinusitis, myalgia, and pharyngitis.

Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone in randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone in the PROactive clinical trial. In these trials, over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for six months or longer, over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for one year or longer, and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone for at least two years. In six pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy and 16- to 24-week add-on combination therapy trials, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4.5% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 5.8% for comparator-treated patients. The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control, although the incidence of these events was lower ( 1.5% ) with pioglitazone than with placebo ( 3% ) . In the PROactive trial, the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9% for patients treated with pioglitazone and 7.7% for placebo-treated patients. Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo. Common Adverse Events: 16- to 26-Week Monotherapy Trials A summary of the incidence and type of common adverse events reported in three pooled 16- to 26-week placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of pioglitazone is provided in Table 1. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of >5% and more commonly in patients treated with pioglitazone than in patients who received placebo.

Almost all patients ( 95% ) were receiving cardiovascular medications ( beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates ) . At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1 c of 8.1% . Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months. The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 ( 19.7% ) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 ( 21.7% ) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint ( hazard ratio 0.9; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.8, 1.02; p=0.1 ) . Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo for the three-year incidence of a first event within this composite, there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone. The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9. Table 9.

The mechanism of weight gain is unclear but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation. Tables 10 and 11 summarize the changes in body weight with pioglitazone and placebo in the 16- to 26-week randomized, double-blind monotherapy and 16- to 24-week combination add-on therapy trials and in the PROactive trial.

One randomized, double-blind 3-year trial comparing pioglitazone to glyburide as add-on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter. A total of 3/1051 ( 0.3% ) patients treated with pioglitazone and 9/1046 ( 0.9% ) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range. None of the patients treated with pioglitazone in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range, a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug-induced liver injury. Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone clinical trials, adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing. In the 16-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.7% with pioglitazone 30 mg and 0.5% with placebo. In the 16-week add-on to insulin trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.9% with pioglitazone 15 mg, 15.4% with pioglitazone 30 mg, and 4.8% with placebo. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone 45 mg compared to pioglitazone 30 mg in both the 24-week add-on to sulfonylurea trial ( 15.7% vs. 13.4% ) and in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial ( 47.8% vs. 43.5% ) . Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia. All three patients were receiving pioglitazone 30 mg ( 0.9% ) in the 24-week add-on to insulin trial. An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia ( defined as causing considerable interference with patient’s usual activities ) that did not require hospitalization. These patients were receiving pioglitazone 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea ( n=2 ) or pioglitazone 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin ( n=12 ) . Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study [see . During the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 ( 0.54% ) randomized to pioglitazone and 5 out of 2633 ( 0.19% ) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 ( 0.23% ) cases on pioglitazone and two ( 0.08% ) cases on placebo. After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to pioglitazone. During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to pioglitazone or placebo ( HR =1; 95% CI: 0.59 to 1.72 ) Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ] [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit. In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, mean hemoglobin values declined by 2% to 4% in patients treated with pioglitazone compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of -1% to +1% in placebo-treated patients. These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter. These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects. Creatine Phosphokinase During protocol-specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) in pioglitazone clinical trials, an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine ( 0.2% ) patients treated with pioglitazone ( values of 2150 to 11400 IU/L ) and in no comparator-treated patients. Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone, two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone due to the elevation. These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae. The relationship of these events to pioglitazone therapy is unknown. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pioglitazone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. • New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] • Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone, both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration. In postmarketing experience, there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials. Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume-related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure [see .
