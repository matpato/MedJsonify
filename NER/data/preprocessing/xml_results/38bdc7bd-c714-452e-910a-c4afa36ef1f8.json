    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE QULIPTA is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. QULIPTA is a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS QULIPTA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to atogepant or any of the components of QULIPTA. Reactions have included anaphylaxis and dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to atogepant or to any of the components of QULIPTA.  ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue QULIPTA and initiate appropriate therapy. Severe hypersensitivity reactions have included anaphylaxis and dyspnea. These reactions can occur days after administration. ( 5.1 ) Hypertension: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension may occur. ( 5.2 ) Raynaud’s phenomenon: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud’s phenomenon may occur. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, and facial edema, have been reported with use of QULIPTA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Hypersensitivity reactions can occur days after administration. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue QULIPTA and institute appropriate therapy [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 5. 2 Hyper tension Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA, in the postmarketing setting. Some of the patients who developed new-onset hypertension had risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment, but was most frequently reported within 7 days of therapy initiation. QULIPTA was discontinued in many of the reported cases. Monitor patients treated with QULIPTA for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of QULIPTA is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology or blood pressure is inadequately controlled. 5. 3 Raynaud’s Phenomenon Development of Raynaud’s phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud’s phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including QULIPTA. In reported cases with small molecule CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 1.5 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms. QULIPTA should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud’s phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud’s phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Raynaud’s Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] The most common adverse reactions (at least 4% and greater than placebo) are nausea, constipation, and fatigue/somnolence. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie at 1-800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of QULIPTA was evaluated in 2657 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of QULIPTA.  Of these, 1225 patients were exposed to QULIPTA for at least 6 months, and 826 patients were exposed for 12 months. In the 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 314 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 10 mg once daily, 411 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 30 mg once daily, 678 patients received at least one dose of QULIPTA 60 mg once daily, and 663 patients received placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] . Approximately 88% were female, 75% were White, 13% were Black, 10% were Asian, and 10% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean age at study entry was 41 years (range 18 to 74 years). The most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 4% and greater than placebo) are nausea, constipation, and fatigue/somnolence. Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred during Studies 1, 2, and 3. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring with an Incidence of At Least 2% for QULIPTA and Greater than Placebo in Studies 1, 2, and 3 * Placebo (N= 663 ) % QULIPTA 10 mg (N=314) % QULIPTA 30 mg (N=411) % QULIPTA 60 mg (N= 678 ) % Nausea 3 5 6 9 Constipation 2 6 6 8 Fatigue/Somnolence 4 4 4 5 Decreased Appetite <1 2 1 3 Dizziness 2 2 2 3 * 10 mg and 30 mg incidence from Studies 1 and 2; 60 mg pooled incidence from Studies 1, 2, and 3. The adverse reactions that most commonly led to discontinuation of QULIPTA in these studies were nausea (0.6%), constipation (0.5%), and fatigue/somnolence (0.2%). Liver Enzyme Elevations In Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3, the rate of transaminase elevations over 3 times the upper limit of normal was similar between patients treated with QULIPTA (0.9%) and those treated with placebo (1.2%). However, there were cases with transaminase elevations over 3 times the upper limit of normal that were temporally associated with QULIPTA treatment; these were asymptomatic and resolved within 8 weeks of discontinuation. There were no cases of severe liver injury or jaundice. Decreases in Body Weight In Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3, the proportion of patients with a weight decrease of at least 7% at any point was 2.5% for placebo, 3.8% for QULIPTA 10 mg, 3.2% for QULIPTA 30 mg, and 5.3% for QULIPTA 60 mg. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of QULIPTA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis, dyspnea, rash, pruritus, urticaria, facial edema) [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Vascular Disorders: Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] , Raynaud’s phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]"
