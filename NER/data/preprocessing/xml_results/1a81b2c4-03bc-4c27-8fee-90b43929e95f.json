( 2.2 , 5.1 ) • Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Severe and fatal cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been reported.  Monitor for pulmonary symptoms of ILD/pneumonitis.  Interrupt IBRANCE immediately in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis.  Permanently discontinue IBRANCE if severe ILD/pneumonitis occurs. ( 5.2 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: IBRANCE can cause fetal harm.  Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\tNeutropenia Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in PALOMA-2 with an incidence of 80% and PALOMA-3 with an incidence of 83%.  A Grade ≥3 decrease in neutrophil counts was reported in 66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-2 and 66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3.  In PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3, the median time to first episode of any grade neutropenia was 15 days and the median duration of Grade ≥3 neutropenia was 7 days [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Monitor complete blood counts prior to starting IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated.  Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across PALOMA-2 and PALOMA-3.  One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in PALOMA-3.  Physicians should inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever [see . Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.2\tInterstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, including IBRANCE when taken in combination with endocrine therapy. Across clinical trials (PALOMA-1, PALOMA-2, PALOMA-3), 1.0% of IBRANCE-treated patients had ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3 or 4 and no fatal cases were reported.  Additional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, cough, dyspnea).  In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms and are suspected to have developed pneumonitis, interrupt IBRANCE immediately and evaluate the patient.  Permanently discontinue IBRANCE in patients with severe ILD or pneumonitis [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.3\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  In animal reproduction studies, administration of palbociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal exposures that were ≥4 times the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC).  Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IBRANCE and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]",

PALOMA-2: IBRANCE plus Letrozole Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer for initial endocrine based therapy The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) versus placebo plus letrozole was evaluated in PALOMA-2.  The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in 444 out of 666 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-2.  The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus letrozole was 19.8 months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus letrozole arm was 13.8 months. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole.  No dose reduction was allowed for letrozole in PALOMA-2. Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 43 of 444 (9.7%) patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole and in 13 of 222 (5.9%) patients receiving placebo plus letrozole.  Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole included neutropenia (1.1%) and alanine aminotransferase increase (0.7%). The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) of any grade reported in patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, anemia, rash, asthenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, decreased appetite, dry skin, pyrexia, and dysgeusia. The most frequently reported Grade ≥3 adverse reactions (≥5%) in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole by descending frequency were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, and anemia. Adverse reactions (≥10%) reported in patients who received IBRANCE plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole in PALOMA-2 are listed in Table 4. Table 4.

The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in 345 out of 517 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in PALOMA-3.  The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus fulvestrant was 10.8 months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus fulvestrant arm was 4.8 months. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant.  No dose reduction was allowed for fulvestrant in PALOMA-3. Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 19 of 345 (6%) patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant, and in 6 of 172 (3%) patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant.  Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant included fatigue (0.6%), infections (0.6%), and thrombocytopenia (0.6%).

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Respiratory Disorders : Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/non-infectious pneumonitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES) Male patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer Based on limited data from postmarketing reports and electronic health records, the safety profile for men treated with IBRANCE is consistent with the safety profile in women treated with IBRANCE."
