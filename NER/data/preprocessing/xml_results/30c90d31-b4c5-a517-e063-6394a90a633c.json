    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Vitafol ® -OB+DHA is indicated to provide vitamin, mineral and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation prior to conception, throughout pregnancy, and during the postnatal period for the lactating and non-lactating mother.* Vitafol ® -OB+DHA does not contain fish, fish oils, fish proteins or fish byproducts.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Vitafol ® -OB+DHA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components or color additives. Folic acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Iron therapy is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage disease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyridoxine responsive anemia, or cirrhosis of the liver. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathryroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur. Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended. Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals, but generally at doses substantially higher than those in Vitafol ® -OB+DHA. Allergic reactions have been reported with some forms of gum acacia to include respiratory problems and skin lesions. Contact your doctor for medical advice about serious adverse events. To report a serious adverse event or obtain product information, contact 1-877-324-9349."
