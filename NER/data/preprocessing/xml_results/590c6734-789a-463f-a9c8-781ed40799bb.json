  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE JATENZO ( testosterone undecanoate ) is an androgen indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone: Primary hypogonadism ( congenital or acquired ) : testicular failure due to conditions such as cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, orchiectomy, Klinefelter syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage from alcohol or heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone concentrations and gonadotropins ( follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] , luteinizing hormone [LH] ) above the normal range. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( congenital or acquired ) : gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from causes such as tumors, trauma, or radiation. These men have low testosterone serum concentrations but have gonadotropins in the normal or low range. Limitations of use: Safety and efficacy of JATENZO in men with “age-related hypogonadism” have not been established. Safety and efficacy of JATENZO in males less than 18 years old have not been established [ see Use in Specific Populations ( ] . 8.4 ) JATENZO ( testosterone undecanoate ) is an androgen indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone ( 1 ) . Limitations of use: Safety and efficacy of JATENZO in men with “age-related hypogonadism” have not been established ( 1 ) Safety and efficacy of JATENZO in males less than 18 years old have not been established ( 1 , 8.4 ) .",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS JATENZO is contraindicated in: Men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ] . 5.3 ) Women who are pregnant. Testosterone can cause virilization of the female fetus when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( ] . 8.1 ) Men with known hypersensitivity to JATENZO or any of its ingredients [ see Description ( ] . 11 ) Men with breast cancer or known or suspected prostate cancer ( 4 , 5.3 ) . Women who are pregnant. Testosterone may cause fetal harm ( 4 , 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.2 ) . Known hypersensitivity to JATENZO or any of its ingredients ( 4 ) .",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Polycythemia: Monitor hematocrit approximately every 3 months to detect increased red blood cell mass and polycythemia ( 5.1 ) . Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) : VTE, including deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , have been reported in patients using testosterone. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE ( 5.2 ) . Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer: Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH ( 5.3 ) . Blood Pressure Increases: JATENZO can increase blood pressure, which can increase cardiovascular risk over time. Measure blood pressure periodically. Not recommended for use in men with uncontrolled hypertension ( 5.4 ) Abuse of Testosterone: Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids ( 5.5 ) . Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis: Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia ( 5.7 ) . Edema: Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may occur in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease ( 5.9 , 6.1 ) . Sleep Apnea: Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors ( 5.11 ) . Monitor prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) and lipid concentrations periodically ( 5.3 , 5.12 ) . Risk of Depression and Suicide: Depression and suicidal ideation have occurred during clinical trials in patients treated with JATENZO ( 5.15 ) . 5.1 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering the dose or discontinuation of JATENZO. Check that hematocrit is not elevated prior to initiating JATENZO. Evaluate hematocrit approximately every 3 months while the patient is on JATENZO. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop JATENZO until the hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. If JATENZO is restarted and again causes hematocrit to become elevated, stop JATENZO permanently. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ] . 5.2 ) 5.2 Venous Thromboembolism There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , in patients using testosterone replacement products such as JATENZO. In the Testosterone Replacement therapy for Assessment of long-term Vascular Events and efficacy ResponSE in hypogonadal men ( TRAVERSE ) Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cardiovascular ( CV ) outcomes study, compared to placebo, topical testosterone gel was associated with a higher risk of VTE ( 1.7% vs 1.2% ) which included DVT ( 0.6% vs 0.5% ) and PE ( 0.9% vs 0.5% ) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with JATENZO and initiate appropriate workup and management [ see Adverse Reactions ( ] . 6.2 ) 5.3 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [ see Contraindications ( ] . 4 ) 5.4 Blood Pressure Increases JATENZO can increase blood pressure. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) demonstrated JATENZO increased systolic /diastolic BP by an average of 4.9/2.5 mmHg from baseline after 4 months of treatment in a clinical trial [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . In patients with hypertension on antihypertensive therapy, JATENZO increased the mean systolic/diastolic BP by 5.4/3.2 mmHg from baseline. Average blood pressures had not plateaued at the end of the trial . The CV risk associated with topical testosterone gel was evaluated in TRAVERSE, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, CV outcomes study in men with a history of CV disease or multiple CV risk factors. In TRAVERSE, topical testosterone gel increased mean systolic blood pressure by 1.8 mmHg from baseline. However, the incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) , including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI] and non-fatal stroke, were similar between treatment groups ( 7% for topical testosterone gel vs 7.3% for placebo ) [See Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Monitor blood pressure periodically in men using JATENZO, especially men with hypertension. JATENZO is not recommended for use in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. 5.5 Abuse of Testosterone and Monitoring of Testosterone Concentrations Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( ] . 9 ) If testosterone abuse is suspected, check testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range [see Dose and Administration ( ] . However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events. 2 ) 5.6 Not for Use in Women Due to lack of controlled studies in women and potential virilizing effects, JATENZO is not indicated for use in women [ see Contraindications ( and 4 ) Use in Specific Populations ( ] . 8.1 , 8.2 ) 5.7 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including JATENZO, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH possibly leading to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count [ see Use in Specific Populations ( ] . Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use JATENZO. 8.3 ) 5.8 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens ( e.g. , methyltestosterone ) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects ( peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice ) . Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas. JATENZO is not known to cause these adverse effects. Nonetheless, patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction ( e.g. jaundice ) . If these occur, promptly discontinue JATENZO while the cause is evaluated. 5.9 Edema Androgens, including JATENZO, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. 5.10 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated for hypogonadism. 5.11 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung disease. 5.12 Lipid Changes Changes in the serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment of lipid lowering drugs or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. Monitor the lipid profile periodically, particularly after starting testosterone therapy. 5.13 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including JATENZO, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia ( and associated hypercalciuria ) . Monitor serum calcium concentrations regularly during treatment with JATENZO in these patients. 5.14 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including JATENZO, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.15 Risk of Depression and Suicide Depression and suicidal ideation has been reported in patients treated with JATENZO in clinical trials. Advise patients and caregivers to seek medical attention for manifestations of new onset or worsening depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, anxiety, or other mood changes [ see Adverse Events ( ] . 6.1 )",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 2% ) : polycythemia, diarrhea, dyspepsia, eructation, peripheral edema, nausea, increased hematocrit, headache, prostatomegaly, and hypertension ( 6.1 ) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Tolmar, Inc. at 1-844-4 TO-LMAR or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of JATENZO was evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical study with 166 patients treated with JATENZO twice daily with morning and evening meals for approximately 4 months. All patients were started on 237 mg twice daily, then the dose was titrated to 158 mg, 198 mg, 316 mg, or 396 mg twice daily to achieve testosterone concentrations in the eugonadal range. Table 2 summarizes adverse reactions ( ≥2% ) reported in this 4-month study. Table 2: Number ( % ) of Patients with Adverse Reactions ≥ 2% in a 4-Month Study with JATENZO Among the 569 patients who received JATENZO in all Phase 2 and 3 trials combined, the following adverse reactions were reported in >2% of patients: polycythemia, diarrhea, dyspepsia, eructation, peripheral edema, nausea, increased hematocrit, headache, prostatomegaly, and hypertension. Three of the 166 patients ( 1.8% ) in the 4-month study experienced adverse reactions that led to premature discontinuation from the study, including rash ( n=1 ) and headache ( n=2 ) . Preferred Term Overall ( N = 166 ) n ( % ) Headache 8 ( 4.8 ) Hematocrit increased 8 ( 4.8 ) Hypertension 6 ( 3.6 ) High-density lipoprotein decreased 5 ( 3.0 ) Nausea 4 ( 2.4 ) BP Increases In the 4-month clinical study, 24-hour ABPM was conducted on 166 patients. ABPM was conducted at baseline and at Day 139 of JATENZO therapy. A total of 135 patients had acceptable ABPM recordings at both time periods and were at least 85% compliant with study drug. In that group, the mean change in 24-hour systolic BP and diastolic BP from baseline to final on-treatment visit on Day 139 ( n=135 ) was +4.9 mmHg ( 95% CI 3.5, 6.4 ) and +2.5 mmHg ( 95% CI 1.5, 3.6 ) , respectively. In patients with a history of hypertension who were receiving antihypertensive therapy, the mean ABPM systolic and diastolic BP increased by 5.4 mmHg [95% CI 3.3, 7.6] and 3.2 mmHg [95% CI 1.7, 4.7] , respectively [n=67] . In patients with no history of hypertension, the mean ABPM systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased by 4.4 mmHg [95% CI 2.3, 6.4] and 1.8 mmHg [95% CI 0.2, 3.3] , respectively [n=63] . Twelve ( 7.2% ) patients on JATENZO either started antihypertensive medications or had their antihypertensive regimen increased during the study. A total of 6 patients were reported to have an adverse reaction of hypertension ( 2 patients with hypertension and 4 patients with worsening hypertension ) , and 3 were reported to have an adverse reaction of increased blood pressure. HR Increases JATENZO increased mean heart rate by an average of 2.2 beats per minute ( bpm ) [95% CI ( 1.0, 3.3 ) , N=135] during the study. Patients without a history of hypertension had a greater average increase in mean heart rate ( 2.7 bpm [95% CI ( 0.8, 4.6 ) , N=63] ) compared to patients with treated hypertension ( 1.9 bpm [95% CI ( 0.3, 3.5 ) , N=67 ) ] ) . Increases in Hematocrit Increases in hematocrit were reported in 8 of the 166 ( 4.8% ) patients, which occurred in the second half of the study. None of these increases led to premature discontinuation of JATENZO. Headaches Headaches were reported in 8 of the 166 patients ( 4.8% ) of which three required treatment with analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 2 led to premature discontinuation from the study. Five of these 8 patients had headache events that resolved within 1 to 2 days. Depression and suicidal ideation Two of the 166 patients ( 1.2% ) reported either worsening depression ( n=1 ) or new-onset depression ( n=1 ) . One of the 569 patients ( 0.2% ) in clinical trials had suicidal ideation. Each patient completed the study. Increases in Serum PSA The mean increase from baseline in PSA was 0.2 ng/mL ( n=161 ) . Increases in serum PSA concentrations, defined as an increase from baseline of at least 1.4 ng/mL or PSA greater than 4 ng/mL, occurred in 3 ( 1.9% ) of the patients at the final visit. Cardiovascular Outcomes TRAVERSE was a randomized, double-blind, cardiovascular outcomes study to assess the cardiovascular ( CV ) safety of topical testosterone gel compared to placebo in 5198 hypogonadal men aged 45 to 80 years with a history of CV disease or with multiple CV risk factors. The primary outcome was the incidence of the composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) , consisting of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) , and non-fatal stroke. The mean duration of therapy was approximately 22 months. The mean duration of follow-up was 33 months. Approximately 61% of all patients discontinued topical testosterone gel or placebo therapy. The mean patient age ( ±SD ) was 63.3 ( 7.9 ) years. Approximately 80% of patients were White, 17% were Black, and 3% were of other races or ethnic groups. Approximately 69% , 84% , and 93% had diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, respectively. Approximately 55% had preexisting cardiovascular disease. The mean serum testosterone concentration at baseline in patients receiving topical testosterone gel was 220.4 ng/dL ( n=2129 ) . The mean serum testosterone concentrations at 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, and 48 months in patients receiving topical testosterone gel were 440.5 ng/dL ( n=1683 ) , 420.9 ng/dl ( n=1125 ) , 428.7 ng/dL ( n=731 ) , and 365.2 ng/dL ( n=220 ) , respectively. For patients treated with topical testosterone gel, the incidence of MACE was 7.0% ( n=182 events ) and for those receiving placebo, the incidence of MACE was 7.3% ( n=190 events ) . The study demonstrated non-inferiority of topical testosterone gel versus placebo because the upper bound of 95% CI was less than the pre-specified risk margin, of 1.5 for MACE ( Hazard Ratio 0.96 [95% CI: 0.78, 1.17] ) . Additional Adverse Reactions Reported in TRAVERSE Additional adverse reactions reported in TRAVERSE at an incidence rate >2% in either treatment group and greater in topical testosterone gel versus placebo included: nonfatal arrythmias warranting intervention ( 5.2% vs 3.3% ) , atrial fibrillation ( 3.5% vs 2.4% ) , acute kidney injury ( 2.3% vs 1.5% ) and bone fracture ( 3.5% vs 2.5% ) . For the adverse reaction of bone fracture, each event was adjudicated by clinical review. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of testosterone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Disorders : myocardial infarction, stroke [ see Warnings and Precautions ( , 5.4 ) Clinical Trial Experience ( ] 6.1 ) Vascular Disorders : Venous thromboembolism [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ] 5.1 )"
