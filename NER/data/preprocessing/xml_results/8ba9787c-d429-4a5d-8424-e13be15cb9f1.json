  "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Buprenorphine HCl Injection is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternate treatments are inadequate. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, even at recommended doses [see reserve Buprenorphine HCl Injection for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g. , non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products] : WARNINGS: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse ] Have not been tolerated, or are not expected to be tolerated, Have not provided adequate analgesia, or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia. Buprenorphine HCl Injection should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.",
  "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Buprenorphine HCl Injection is contraindicated in patients with: Significant respiratory depression [See . WARNINGS ] Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment [See WARNINGS ] . Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [See . WARNINGS ] Hypersensitivity to buprenorphine ( e.g. anaphylaxis ) or any other ingredient in Buprenorphine HCl Injection [See WARNINGS ] .",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Buprenorphine HCl contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance. As an opioid, buprenorphine HCl exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed buprenorphine HCl. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing buprenorphine HCl, and reassess all patients receiving buprenorphine HCl for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse ( including drug or alcohol addiction or abuse ) or mental illness ( e.g. , major depression ) . The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the prescribing of buprenorphine HCl for the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as buprenorphine HCl, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of buprenorphine HCl along with the frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing buprenorphine HCl. Strategies to reduce these risks include proper product storage and control practices for a C-III drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory depression and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status. Carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of buprenorphine HCl, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of buprenorphine HCl are essential. Overestimating the buprenorphine HCl dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea ( CSA ) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see . Dosage and Administration ] Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of buprenorphine HCl with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol ( e.g. , non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids ) . Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see Drug Interactions ] . If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of buprenorphine HCl for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients , Pregnancy ] . Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia ( OIH ) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see ] . DEPENDENCE Symptoms of OIH include ( but may not be limited to ) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli ( allodynia ) . These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation ( safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety ) [see ] . DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION , WARNINGS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of buprenorphine HCl in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Buprenorphine HCl-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive, including apnea, even at recommended dosages of buprenorphine HCl [see . WARNINGS ] Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients. Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating buprenorphine HCl and when buprenorphine HCl is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. WARNINGS ] . Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. Severe Hypotension Buprenorphine HCl may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume, or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs ( e.g. , phenothiazines or general anesthetics ) . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of buprenorphine HCl. In patients with circulatory shock, buprenorphine HCl may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of buprenorphine HCl in patients with circulatory shock. Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention ( e.g. , those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors ) , buprenorphine HCl may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with buprenorphine HCl. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of buprenorphine HCl in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. QTc Prolongation Thorough QT studies with buprenorphine products have demonstrated QT prolongation ≤ 15 msec. This QTc prolongation effect does not appear to be mediated by hERG channels. Based on these two findings, buprenorphine is unlikely to be pro-arrhythmic when used alone in patients without risk factors. The risk of combining buprenorphine with other QT-prolonging agents is not known. Consider these observations in clinical decisions when prescribing Buprenorphine HCl to patients with risk factors such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, recent conversion from atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, digitalis therapy, baseline QT prolongation, subclinical long-QT syndrome, or severe hypomagnesemia. Anaphylactic/Allergic Reactions Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported both in clinical trials and in post-marketing experience. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. Buprenorphine HCl is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine. Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Buprenorphine HCl is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The buprenorphine in buprenorphine HCl injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in the serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The buprenorphine in buprenorphine HCl injection may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during buprenorphine HCl therapy. Risks Driving and Operating Machinery Buprenorphine HCl may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of buprenorphine HCl and know how they will react to the medication [see PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ] . PRECAUTIONS General Buprenorphine HCl should be administered with caution in the elderly, debilitated patients, in children and those with severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; myxedema or hypothyroidism; adrenal cortical insufficiency ( e.g. , Addison’s disease ) ; CNS depression or coma; toxic psychoses; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; acute alcoholism; delirium tremens; or kyphoscoliosis. Because buprenorphine HCl is metabolized by the liver, the activity of buprenorphine HCl may be increased and/or extended in those individuals with impaired hepatic function or those receiving other agents known to decrease hepatic clearance. Buprenorphine HCl has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure to a similar degree as other opioid analgesics, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. Information for Patients Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Inform patients that the use of buprenorphine HCl, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose or death [see . WARNINGS ] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting buprenorphine HCl or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages [see WARNINGS ] . Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see . WARNINGS , ADVERSE REACTIONS ] Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see . PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ] Constipation Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics , ADVERSE REACTIONS ] . Drug Interactions Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Buprenorphine HCl Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Intervention: Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression ( including sedation ) . Examples: Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, alcohol. Inhibitors of CYP3 A4 Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of buprenorphine and CYP3 A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of buprenorphine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of buprenorphine HCl is achieved. After stopping a CYP3 A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the buprenorphine plasma concentration will decrease [see , potentially resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to buprenorphine. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics ] Intervention: If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of buprenorphine HCl until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation. If a CYP3 A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the buprenorphine HCl dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. Examples: Macrolide antibiotics ( e.g. , erythromycin ) , azole-antifungal agents ( e.g. ketoconazole ) , protease inhibitors ( e.g. , ritonavir ) CYP3 A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of buprenorphine and CYP3 A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of buprenorphine [see , potentially resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to buprenorphine. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics ] After stopping a CYP3 A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the buprenorphine plasma concentration will increase [see , which could increase or prolong both therapeutic effects and adverse reactions and may cause serious respiratory depression. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics ] Intervention: If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the buprenorphine HCl dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3 A4 inducer is discontinued, consider buprenorphine HCl dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression. Examples: Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue buprenorphine HCl if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system ( e.g. , mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol ) , certain muscle relaxants ( i.e. , cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone ) , monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors ( those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue ) . Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOIs ) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome opioid toxicity ( e.g. , respiratory depression, coma ) . Intervention: The use of buprenorphine HCl is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. Examples: phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Clinical Impact: May reduce the analgesic effect of buprenorphine HCl and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use. Examples: butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Buprenorphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Intervention: Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and buprenorphine HCl for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of buprenorphine HCl and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase the risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when buprenorphine HCl is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Antiretrovirals: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NRTIs ) Clinical Impact: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) do not appear to induce or inhibit the P450 enzyme pathway, thus no interactions with buprenorphine are expected. Intervention: None Antiretrovirals: Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) Clinical Impact: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) are metabolized principally by CYP3 A4. Efavirenz, nevirapine, and etravirine are known CYP3 A inducers, whereas delaviridine is a CYP3 A inhibitor. Significant pharmacokinetic interactions between NNRTIs ( e.g. , efavirenz and delavirdine ) and buprenorphine have been shown in clinical studies, but these pharmacokinetic interactions did not result in any significant pharmacodynamic effects. Intervention: If prescribing an NNRTI to a patient taking BUPRENEX, frequently reevaluate for this interaction and adjust dosing as necessary. Examples: efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, delavirdine Antiretrovirals: Protease Inhibitors ( PIs ) Clinical Impact: Studies have shown some antiretroviral protease inhibitors ( PIs ) with CYP3 A4 inhibitory activity ( nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir ) have little effect on buprenorphine pharmacokinetic and no significant pharmacodynamic effects. Other PIs with CYP3 A4 inhibitory activity ( atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir ) resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, and patients in one study reported increased sedation. Symptoms of opioid excess have been found in post- marketing reports of patients receiving buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly. Intervention: Monitor patients taking buprenorphine HCl and atazanavir with and without ritonavir, and dose reduction of buprenorphine HCl may be warranted. Examples: atazanavir, ritonavir Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice. Buprenorphine was administered in the diet at doses of 0.6, 5.5, and 56 mg/kg/day for 27 months in rats. These doses were approximately equivalent to 5.7, 52 and 534 times the recommended human dose ( 1.2 mg ) on a mg/m 2 body surface area basis. Statistically significant dose-related increases in testicular interstitial ( Leydig’s ) cell tumors occurred, according to the trend test adjusted for survival. Pairwise comparison of the high dose against control failed to show statistical significance. In the mouse study, buprenorphine was administered in the diet at doses of 8, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day for 86 weeks. The high dose was approximately equivalent to 477 times the recommended human dose ( 1.2 mg ) on a mg/m 2 basis. Buprenorphine was not carcinogenic in mice. Mutagenesis Buprenorphine was studied in a series of tests. Results were negative in Chinese hamster bone marrow and spermatogonia cells, and negative in mouse lymphoma L5178 Y assay. Results were equivocal in the Ames test: negative in studies in two laboratories, but positive in frame shift mutation at high dose ( 5 mg/plate ) in a third study. Impairment of Fertility Reproduction studies of buprenorphine in rats demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at daily oral doses up to 80 mg/kg ( approximately 763 times the recommended human daily dose of 1.2 mg on a mg/m 2 basis ) or up to 5 mg/kg I.M. or S.C. ( approximately 48 times the recommended human daily dose of 1.2 mg on a mg/m 2 basis ) . Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see . Available data with buprenorphine HCl in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. WARNINGS: Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ] Reproductive and developmental studies in rats and rabbits identified adverse events at approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine HCl. Embryofetal death was observed in both rats and rabbits administered buprenorphine during the period of organogenesis at doses approximately 54 and 2.2 times, respectively, the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine. Pre- and postnatal development studies in rats demonstrated increased neonatal deaths at 2.7 times and above and dystocia at approximately 27 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine. No clear teratogenic effects were seen when buprenorphine was administered during organogenesis with a range of doses 5 times or greater than the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine. However, increases in skeletal abnormalities were noted in rats and rabbits administered buprenorphine daily during organogenesis at doses approximately 5.4 and 10.8 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg/day of buprenorphine, respectively. In a few studies, some events such as acephalus and omphalocele were also observed but these findings were not clearly treatment-related [see . Based on animal data, advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Data ] The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20% , respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or failure to gain weight. Signs of neonatal withdrawal usually occur in the first days after birth. The duration and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome may vary. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see WARNINGS: Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome ] . Labor and Delivery The safety of buprenorphine HCl given during labor and delivery has not been established. As with all opioids, use of buprenorphine prior to delivery may result in respiratory depression in the newborn. Closely monitor neonates for signs of respiratory depression. An opioid antagonist such as naloxone should be available for reversal of opioid induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Data Human Data Studies have been conducted to evaluate neonatal outcomes in women exposed to buprenorphine during pregnancy. Limited published data on malformations from trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports on buprenorphine use in pregnancy have not shown an increased risk of major malformations. Based on these studies the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome is not clear and there does not appear to be a dose-response relationship. Animal Data The exposure margins listed below are based on body surface area comparisons ( mg/m 2 ) to MRHD of 1.8 mg buprenorphine via buprenorphine HCl injection. Following oral administration to rats no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 250 mg/kg/day ( estimated exposure approximately 1351 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) in the presence of maternal toxicity ( mortality ) . Following oral administration to rabbits, no teratogenic effects were observed at buprenorphine doses up to 40 mg/kg/day ( estimated exposure approximately 432 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) in the absence of clear maternal toxicity. No definitive drug-related teratogenic effects were observed in rats and rabbits at IM doses up to 30 mg/kg/day ( estimated exposure approximately 161 times and 324 times, respectively, the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) . Maternal toxicity resulting in mortality was noted in these studies in both rats and rabbits. Acephalus was observed in one rabbit fetus from the low-dose group and omphalocele was observed in two rabbit fetuses from the same litter in the mid-dose group; no findings were observed in fetuses from the high-dose group. Maternal toxicity was seen in the high-dose group but not at the lower doses where the findings were observed. Following oral administration of buprenorphine to rats, dose-related post-implantation losses, evidenced by increases in the numbers of early resorptions with consequent reductions in the numbers of fetuses, were observed at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater ( estimated exposure approximately 54 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) . In the rabbit, increased post-implantation losses occurred at an oral dose of 40 mg/kg/day. Following IM administration in the rat and the rabbit, post-implantation losses, as evidenced by decreases in live fetuses and increases in resorptions, occurred at 30 mg/kg/day. Buprenorphine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits after IM or subcutaneous ( SC ) doses up to 5 mg/kg/day ( estimated exposure was approximately 27 and 54 times, respectively, the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) , after IV doses up to 0.8 mg/kg/day ( estimated exposure was approximately 4.3 and 8.7 times, respectively, the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) , or after oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day in rats ( estimated exposure was approximately 865 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) and 25 mg/kg/day in rabbits ( estimated exposure was approximately 270 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) . Significant increases in skeletal abnormalities ( e.g. , extra thoracic vertebra or thoraco-lumbar ribs ) were noted in rats after SC administration of 1 mg/kg/day and up ( estimated exposure was approximately 5.4 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) , but were not observed at oral doses up to 160 mg/kg/day. Increases in skeletal abnormalities in rabbits after IM administration of 5 mg/kg/day ( estimated exposure was approximately 54 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) in the absence of maternal toxicity or oral administration of 1 mg/kg/day or greater ( estimated exposure was approximately 10.8 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) were not statistically significant. In rabbits, buprenorphine produced statistically significant pre-implantation losses at oral doses of 1 mg/kg/day or greater and post-implantation losses that were statistically significant at IV doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day or greater ( estimated exposure approximately 2.2 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) . No maternal toxicity was noted at doses causing post-implantation loss in this study. Dystocia was noted in pregnant rats treated intramuscularly with buprenorphine from Gestation Day 14 through Lactation Day 21 at 5 mg/kg/day ( approximately 27 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) . Fertility, pre- , and post-natal development studies with buprenorphine in rats indicated increases in neonatal mortality after oral doses of 0.8 mg/kg/day and up ( approximately 4.3 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) , after IM doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day and up ( approximately 2.7 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) , and after SC doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day and up ( approximately 0.5 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) . An apparent lack of milk production during these studies likely contributed to the decreased pup viability and lactation indices. Delays in the occurrence of righting reflex and startle response were noted in rat pups at an oral dose of 80 mg/kg/day ( approximately 432 times the MRHD of 1.8 mg ) . Lactation An apparent lack of milk production during general reproduction studies with buprenorphine in rats caused decreased viability and lactation indices. Use of high doses of sublingual buprenorphine in pregnant women showed that buprenorphine passes into the mother’s milk. Breast-feeding is therefore not advised in nursing mothers treated with buprenorphine HCl. Clinical Considerations Breast-feeding is therefore not advised in nursing mothers treated with buprenorphine HCl. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see ADVERSE REACTIONS ] . Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine HCl have been established for children between 2 and 12 years of age. Use of buprenorphine HCl in children is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of buprenorphine HCl in adults, with additional data from studies of 960 children ranging in age from 9 months to 18 years of age. Data is available from a pharmacokinetic study, several controlled clinical trials, and several large post-marketing studies and case series. The available information provides reasonable evidence that buprenorphine HCl may be used safely in children ranging from 2 to 12 years of age, and that it is of similar effectiveness in children as in adults. Geriatric Use Elderly patients ( aged 65 years or older ) may have increased sensitivity to buprenorphine. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of buprenorphine HCl slowly in geriatric patients and monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression [see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS ] . Buprenorphine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.",
  "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent side effect in clinical studies involving 1.133 patients was sedation which occurred in approximately two-thirds of the patients. Although sedated, these patients could easily be aroused to an alert state. Other less frequent adverse reactions occurring in 5 to 10% of the patients were: Nausea Dizziness/Vertigo Occurring in 1 to 5% of the patients: Sweating Headache Hypotension Nausea/Vomiting Vomiting Hypoventilation Miosis The following adverse reactions were reported to have occurred in less than 1% of the patients: CNS Effect: confusion, blurred vision, euphoria, weakness/fatigue, dry mouth, nervousness, depression, slurred speech, paresthesia. Cardiovascular: hypertension, tachycardia, bradycardia. Gastrointestinal: constipation. Respiratory: dyspnea, cyanosis. Dermatological: pruritus. Ophthalmological: diplopia, visual abnormalities. Miscellaneous: injection site reaction, urinary retention, dreaming, flushing/warmth, chills/cold, tinnitus, conjunctivitis, Wenckebach block, and psychosis. Other effects observed infrequently include malaise, hallucinations, depersonalization, coma, dyspepsia, flatulence, apnea, rash, amblyopia, tremor, and pallor. The following reactions have been reported to occur rarely: loss of appetite, dysphoria/agitation, diarrhea, urticaria, and convulsions/lack of muscle coordination. Allergic Reactions: Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing experience of buprenorphine HCl injection and other buprenorphine-containing products. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to buprenorphine HCl injection. In the United Kingdom, buprenorphine HCl was made available under monitored release regulation during the first year of sale, and yielded data from 1.736 physicians on 9.123 patients ( 17.120 administrations ) . Data on 240 children under the age of 18 years were included in this monitored release program. No important new adverse effects attributable to buprenorphine HCl were observed. Postmarketing Experience Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics ] Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see . WARNINGS ] Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor ( e.g. , diabetes ) ."
