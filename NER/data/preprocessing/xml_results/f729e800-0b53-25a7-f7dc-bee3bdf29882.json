  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Bromfenac Ophthalmic Solution, 0.07% is indicated for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and reduction of ocular pain in patients who have undergone cataract surgery. Bromfenac Ophthalmic Solution, 0.07% is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) indicated for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and reduction of ocular pain in patients who have undergone cataract surgery.

  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Sulfite Allergic Reactions ( 5.1 ) • Slow or Delayed Healing ( 5.2 ) • Potential for Cross-Sensitivity ( 5.3 ) • Increased Bleeding Time ( 5.4 ) • Keratitis and Corneal Reactions ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Sulfite Allergic Reactions Bromfenac ophthalmic solution, 0.07% contains sodium sulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people. 5.2 Slow or Delayed Healing All topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , including bromfenac, may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. 5.3 Potential for Cross-Sensitivity There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs, including bromfenac. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs. 5.4 Increased Bleeding Time With some NSAIDs, including bromfenac, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with platelet aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied NSAIDs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues ( including hyphemas ) in conjunction with ocular surgery. It is recommended that bromfenac ophthalmic solution, 0.07% be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications which may prolong bleeding time. 5.5 Keratitis and Corneal Reactions Use of topical NSAIDs, including bromfenac, may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs, including bromfenac, and should be closely monitored for corneal health. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases ( e.g. , dry eye syndrome ) , rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 24 hours prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days postsurgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events. 5.6 Risk of Contamination Do not touch dropper tip to the eye, eyelids, or to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Replace the bottle cap after using. 5.7 Contact Lens Wear Bromfenac ophthalmic solution, 0.07% should not be instilled while wearing contact lenses. Remove contact lenses prior to instillation of bromfenac ophthalmic solution, 0.07% . The preservative in bromfenac ophthalmic solution, 0.07% , benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Lenses may be reinserted after 10 minutes following administration of bromfenac ophthalmic solution, 0.07% .",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions in 3 to 8% of patients were anterior chamber inflammation, foreign body sensation, eye pain, photophobia, and blurred vision ( 6.1 ) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most commonly reported adverse reactions following use of bromfenac ophthalmic solution, 0.07% following cataract surgery include: anterior chamber inflammation, foreign body sensation, eye pain, photophobia, and vision blurred. These reactions were reported in 3% to 8% of patients."
