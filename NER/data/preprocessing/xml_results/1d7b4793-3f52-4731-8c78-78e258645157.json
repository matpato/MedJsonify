    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage : Monitor for bleeding and manage ( 5.1 ). Infections : Monitor patients for fever and infections, evaluate promptly, and treat ( 5.2 ). Cardiac Arrhythmias , Cardiac Failure , and Sudden Death : Monitor for symptoms of arrhythmias and cardiac failure and manage ( 5.3 ). Hypertension : Monitor blood pressure and treat ( 5.4 ). Cytopenias : Check complete blood counts monthly ( 5.5 ). Second Primary Malignancies : Other malignancies have occurred in patients, including skin cancers, and other carcinomas ( 5.6 ). Hepatotoxicity, Including Drug- Induced Liver Injury :  Monitor hepatic function throughout treatment ( 5.7 ). Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) : Assess baseline risk and take precautions. Monitor and treat for TLS ( 5.8 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.9 , 8.1 , 8.3 ). 5.1 Hemorrhage Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients who received IMBRUVICA. Major hemorrhage (≥ Grade 3, serious, or any central nervous system events; e.g., intracranial hemorrhage [including subdural hematoma], gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and post procedural hemorrhage) occurred in 4.2% of patients, with fatalities occurring in 0.4% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA in 27 clinical trials. Bleeding events of any grade including bruising and petechiae occurred in 39%, and excluding bruising and petechiae occurred in 23% of patients who received IMBRUVICA, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood. Use of either anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents concomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major hemorrhage. Across clinical trials, 3.1% of 2,838 patients who received IMBRUVICA without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy experienced major hemorrhage.  The addition of antiplatelet therapy with or without anticoagulant therapy increased this percentage to 4.4%, and the addition of anticoagulant therapy with or without antiplatelet therapy increased this percentage to 6.1%.  Consider the risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co-administered with IMBRUVICA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 5.2 Infections Fatal and non-fatal infections (including bacterial, viral, or fungal) have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 21% of 1,476 patients with B-cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )] . Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA. Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. Monitor and evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias, Cardiac Failure, and Sudden Death Fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure have occurred with IMBRUVICA. Deaths due to cardiac causes or sudden deaths occurred in 1% of 4,896 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials, including in patients who received IMBRUVICA in unapproved monotherapy or combination regimens. These adverse reactions occurred in patients with and without preexisting hypertension or cardiac comorbidities. Patients with cardiac comorbidities may be at greater risk of these events. Grade 3 or greater ventricular tachyarrhythmias were reported in 0.2%, Grade 3 or greater atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were reported in 3.7%, and Grade 3 or greater cardiac failure was reported in 1.3% of 4,896 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials, including in patients who received IMBRUVICA in unapproved monotherapy or combination regimens. These events have occurred particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors including hypertension and diabetes mellitus, a previous history of cardiac arrhythmias, and in patients with acute infections [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Evaluate cardiac history and function at baseline, and monitor patients for cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac function.  Obtain further evaluation (e.g., ECG, echocardiogram) as indicated for patients who develop symptoms of arrhythmia (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, chest pain), new onset dyspnea, or other cardiovascular concerns. Manage cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure appropriately, follow dose modification guidelines [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] , and consider the risks and benefits of continued IMBRUVICA treatment. 5.4 Hypertension Hypertension occurred in 19% of 1,476 patients with B-cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials.  Grade 3 or greater hypertension occurred in 8% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Based on data from a subset of these patients (N=1,124), the median time to onset was 5.9 months (range, 0 to 24 months). In a long-term safety analysis over 5 years of 1,284 patients with B-cell malignancies treated for a median of 36 months (range, 0 to 98 months), the cumulative rate of hypertension increased over time. The prevalence for Grade 3 or greater hypertension was 4% (year 0-1), 7% (year 1-2), 9% (year 2-3), 9% (year 3-4), and 9% (year 4-5); the overall incidence for the 5-year period was 11%. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA, initiate or adjust anti-hypertensive medication throughout treatment with IMBRUVICA as appropriate, and follow dosage modification guidelines for Grade 3 or higher hypertension [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . 5.5 Cytopenias In 645 patients with B-cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA as a single agent, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 23% of patients, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 8% and grade 3 or 4 anemia in 2.8%, based on laboratory measurements [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Monitor complete blood counts monthly. 5.6 Second Primary Malignancies Other malignancies (10%), including non-skin carcinomas (3.9%), occurred among the 1,476 patients with B-cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The most frequent second primary malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (6%). 5.7 Hepatotoxicity, Including Drug-Induced Liver Injury Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), has occurred in patients treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including IMBRUVICA. Evaluate bilirubin and transaminases at baseline and throughout treatment with IMBRUVICA. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after IMBRUVICA, monitor more frequently for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity. If DILI is suspected, withhold IMBRUVICA. Upon confirmation of DILI, discontinue IMBRUVICA. 5. 8 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with IMBRUVICA [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] .  Assess the baseline risk (e.g., high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions. Monitor patients closely and treat as appropriate. 5. 9 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals, IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Administration of ibrutinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity including malformations at exposures that were 3-20 times higher than those reported in patients with hematologic malignancies. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMBRUVICA and for 1 month after the last dose.

    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Cardiac Arrhythmias, Cardiac Failure, and Sudden Death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Second Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hepatotoxicity, including DILI [see Warning s and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] The most common (≥30%) adverse reactions in patients with B-cell malignancies are thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neutropenia, rash, anemia, bruising, and nausea ( 6 ). The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in adult or pediatric patients with cGVHD are fatigue, anemia, bruising, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, muscle spasms, stomatitis, hemorrhage, nausea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, and headache ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pharmacyclics at 1-877-877-3536 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Unless otherwise specified, the pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to IMBRUVICA in 6 trials. IMBRUVICA was  administered as a single agent at 420 mg orally once daily (475 patients), as a single agent at 560 mg orally once daily [1.3 times the recommended adult dosage (174 patients)], and in combination with other drugs at 420 mg orally once daily (827 patients) in patients with B-cell malignancies.  In this pooled safety population of 1,476 patients, 87% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 68% were exposed for greater than one year.  The most common adverse reactions (≥ 30%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neutropenia, rash, anemia, bruising, and nausea. Certain subsections in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS include patients who received IMBRUVICA in unapproved monotherapy or combination regimens. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in one single-arm, open-label clinical trial (Study 1102) and five randomized controlled clinical trials (RESONATE, RESONATE-2, HELIOS, iLLUMINATE, and E1912) in patients with CLL/SLL (n=2,016 total, including n=1,133 patients exposed to IMBRUVICA). In general, patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≤ 30 mL/min, AST or ALT ≥ 2.5 x ULN, or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x ULN (unless of non-hepatic origin) were excluded from these trials. In Study E1912, patients with AST or ALT > 3 x ULN or total bilirubin > 2.5 x ULN were excluded. Study 1102 included 51 patients with previously treated CLL/SLL. RESONATE included 386 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL who received single agent IMBRUVICA or ofatumumab. RESONATE-2 included 267 randomized patients with treatment naïve CLL or SLL who were 65 years or older and received single agent IMBRUVICA or chlorambucil. HELIOS included 574 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL who received IMBRUVICA in combination with BR or placebo in combination with BR. iLLUMINATE included 228 randomized patients with treatment naïve CLL/SLL who were 65 years or older or with coexisting medical conditions and received IMBRUVICA in combination with obinutuzumab or chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. E1912 included 510 patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL who were 70 years or younger and received IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab or received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). The most common adverse reactions in patients with CLL/SLL receiving IMBRUVICA (≥ 30%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neutropenia, rash, anemia, bruising, and nausea. Four to 10 percent of patients with CLL/SLL receiving IMBRUVICA discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. These included pneumonia, hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, neutropenia, arthralgia, rash, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in approximately 9% of patients. Study 1102 Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities from Study 1102 (N=51) using single agent IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily in patients with previously treated CLL/SLL occurring at a rate of ≥ 10% with a median duration of treatment of 15.6 months are presented in Table 5 and Table 6 .

Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in two single-arm  clinical trials (Study 1118 and the INNOVATE monotherapy arm) and one randomized controlled trial (INNOVATE), including a total of 169 patients with WM exposed to IMBRUVICA. Study 1118 included 63 patients with previously treated WM who received single agent IMBRUVICA. INNOVATE included 150 patients with treatment naïve or previously treated WM who received IMBRUVICA or placebo in combination with rituximab. The INNOVATE monotherapy arm included 31 patients with previously treated WM who received IMBRUVICA after failure of prior rituximab-containing therapy. The most common adverse reactions in Studies 1118 and INNOVATE (≥ 20%) were neutropenia, diarrhea, bruising, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, musculoskeletal pain, rash, and nausea. Five percent of patients receiving IMBRUVICA across Studies 1118 and INNOVATE discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was atrial fibrillation. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 14% of patients.

Patients age 12 years and older were treated with IMBRUVICA 420 mg orally once daily, and patients age 1 year to less than 12 years were treated with IMBRUVICA 240 mg/m 2 orally once daily [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . The median duration of exposure to IMBRUVICA was 7.1 months (range, 0.2 to 25.9 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 64% of patients who received IMBRUVICA. Serious adverse reactions in more than two patients included pneumonia, pyrexia, sepsis, and stomatitis.  Fatal adverse reactions occurred in two patients who received IMBRUVICA, including sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Permanent discontinuation of IMBRUVICA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation in at least two patients included hemorrhage. Dose reductions of IMBRUVICA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reduction in at least two patients included stomatitis. The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were anemia, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, diarrhea, pneumonia, abdominal pain, stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, and headache.

Additional Important Adverse Reactions Cardiovascular Events Data on cardiovascular events are based on randomized controlled trials with IMBRUVICA (n=2,115; median treatment duration of 19.1 months for 1,157 patients treated with IMBRUVICA and 5.3 months for 958 patients in the control arm). The incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular flutter, and ventricular tachycardia) of any grade was 1.0% versus 0.4% and of Grade 3 or greater was 0.3% versus 0% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to patients in the control arm.  The incidence of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of any grade was 8.4% versus 1.6% and for Grade 3 or greater was 4.0% versus 0.5% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to patients in the control arm. In addition, the incidence of cardiac failure of any grade was 1.7% versus 0.5% and for Grade 3 or greater was 1.2% versus 0.3% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to patients in the control arm. The incidence of ischemic cerebrovascular events (cerebrovascular accidents, ischemic stroke, cerebral ischemia, and transient ischemic attack) of any grade was 1% versus 0.4% and Grade 3 or greater was 0.5% versus 0.2% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to patients in the control arm, respectively. Diarrhea In randomized controlled trials (n=2,115; median treatment duration of 19.1 months for 1,157 patients treated with IMBRUVICA and 5.3 months for 958 patients in the control arm), diarrhea of any grade occurred at a rate of 43% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to 19% of patients in the control arm. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 3% versus 1% of IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. Less than 1% (0.3%) of subjects discontinued IMBRUVICA due to diarrhea compared with 0% in the control arm. Based on data from 1,605 of these patients, the median time to first onset was 21 days (range, 0 to 708) versus 46 days (range, 0 to 492) for any grade diarrhea and 117 days (range, 3 to 414) versus 194 days (range, 11 to 325) for Grade 3 diarrhea in IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 85% versus 89% had complete resolution, and 15% versus 11% had not reported resolution at time of analysis in IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. The median time from onset to resolution in IMBRUVICA-treated subjects was 7 days (range, 1 to 655) versus 4 days (range, 1 to 367) for any grade diarrhea and 7 days (range, 1 to 78) versus 19 days (range, 1 to 56) for Grade 3 diarrhea in IMBRUVICA-treated subjects compared to the control arm, respectively. Visual Disturbance In randomized controlled trials (n=2,115; median treatment duration of 19.1 months for 1,157 patients treated with IMBRUVICA and 5.3 months for 958 patients in the control arm), blurred vision and decreased visual acuity of any grade occurred in 11% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA (9% Grade 1, 2% Grade 2, no Grade 3 or higher) compared to 6% in the control arm (5% Grade 1 and < 1% Grade 2 and 3). Based on data from 1,605 of these patients, the median time to first onset was 91 days (range, 0 to 617) versus 100 days (range, 2 to 477) in IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. Of the patients who reported visual disturbances, 60% versus 71% had complete resolution and 40% versus 29% had not reported resolution at the time of analysis in IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively.  The median time from onset to resolution was 37 days (range, 1 to 457) versus 26 days (range, 1 to 721) in IMBRUVICA-treated subjects compared to the control arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of IMBRUVICA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic failure including acute and/or fatal events, hepatic cirrhosis, drug-induced liver injury Respiratory disorders: interstitial lung disease Metabolic and nutrition disorders: tumor lysis syndrome Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, angioedema, urticaria Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), onychoclasis, panniculitis, neutrophilic dermatoses, cutaneous vasculitis Infections: hepatitis B reactivation Nervous system disorders: peripheral neuropathy"
