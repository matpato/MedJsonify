    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ADDYI is indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), as characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is NOT due to: • A co-existing medical or psychiatric condition, • Problems within the relationship, or • The effects of a medication or other drug substance. Acquired HSDD refers to HSDD that develops in a patient who previously had no problems with sexual desire. Generalized HSDD refers to HSDD that occurs regardless of the type of stimulation, situation or partner. Limitations of Use • ADDYI is not indicated for the treatment of HSDD in postmenopausal women or in men. • ADDYI is not indicated to enhance sexual performance. ADDYI is indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) as characterized by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is NOT due to: • A co-existing medical or psychiatric condition, • Problems within the relationship, or • The effects of a medication or other drug substance.

    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ADDYI is contraindicated in patients: • Using concomitant moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see . and Boxed Warning ] Warnings and Precautions (5.2) • With hepatic impairment [see . and Boxed Warning ] Warnings and Precautions (5.5) • With known hypersensitivity to ADDYI or any of its components. Reactions, including anaphylaxis, reactions consistent with angioedema (e.g., swelling of the face, lips, and mouth), pruritus, and urticaria have been reported [see . ] Adverse Reactions (6.2) • Moderate or strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (4, 5.2) • Hepatic impairment (4, 5.5)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypotension and Syncope due to an Interaction with Alcohol : After taking ADDYI at bedtime, advise patients to avoid alcohol until the following day. (5.1) • Hypotension and Syncope with ADDYI Alone : Patients with pre-syncope should immediately lie supine and promptly seek medical help if symptoms do not resolve. (5.4) • Hypersensitivity Reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, pruritus, urticaria : Avoid in women with known hypersensitivity to ADDYI or any of its components ( ) 5.6 • Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression (e.g., Somnolence, Sedation) : Can occur with ADDYI alone. Exacerbated by other CNS depressants, and in settings where flibanserin concentrations are increased. Patients should avoid activities requiring full alertness (e.g., operating machinery or driving) until at least six hours after each dose and until they know how ADDYI affects them. (5.3) 5.1 Hypotension and Syncope due to an Interaction with Alcohol Taking ADDYI within two hours after consuming alcohol increases the risk of severe hypotension and syncope. To reduce this risk, counsel patients to wait at least two hours after drinking one or two standard alcoholic drinks before taking ADDYI at bedtime [see . Patients who drink three or more standard alcoholic drinks should skip their ADDYI dose that evening. One standard alcoholic drink contains 14 grams of pure alcohol and is equivalent to one 12-ounce regular beer (5% alcohol), 5-ounces wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits/shot (40% alcohol). Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] After taking ADDYI at bedtime, advise patients to not use alcohol until the following day. 5.2 Hypotension and Syncope with CYP3A4 Inhibitors Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors The concomitant use of ADDYI with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors significantly increases flibanserin concentrations, which can lead to hypotension and syncope [see The concomitant use of ADDYI with a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is contraindicated. If the patient requires a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, discontinue ADDYI at least 2 days prior to starting the moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. In cases where the benefit of initiating a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor within 2 days of stopping ADDYI clearly outweighs the risk of flibanserin exposure related hypotension and syncope, monitor the patient for signs of hypotension and syncope. Discontinue the moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor for 2 weeks before restarting ADDYI Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Multiple Concomitant Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of multiple weak CYP3A4 inhibitors that may include herbal supplements (e.g., ginkgo, resveratrol) or non-prescription drugs (e.g., cimetidine) could also lead to clinically relevant increases in flibanserin concentrations that may increase the risk of hypotension and syncope [see . Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.3 Central Nervous System Depression ADDYI can cause CNS depression (e.g., somnolence, sedation). In five 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of premenopausal women with HSDD, the incidence of somnolence, sedation or fatigue was 21% and 8% in patients treated with 100 mg ADDYI once daily at bedtime and placebo, respectively [see . The risk of CNS depression is increased if ADDYI is taken during waking hours, or if ADDYI is taken with alcohol or other CNS depressants, or with medications that increase flibanserin concentrations, such as CYP3A4 inhibitors Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Patients should not drive or engage in other activities requiring full alertness until at least 6 hours after taking ADDYI and until they know how ADDYI affects them [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 5.4 Hypotension and Syncope with ADDYI Alone The use of ADDYI − without other concomitant medications known to cause hypotension or syncope − can cause hypotension and syncope. In five 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of premenopausal women with HSDD, hypotension was reported in 0.2% and <0.1% of ADDYI-treated patients and placebo-treated patients, respectively; syncope was reported in 0.4% and 0.2% of ADDYI- treated patients and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The risk of hypotension and syncope is increased if ADDYI is taken during waking hours or if higher than the recommended dose is taken [see Consider the benefits of ADDYI and the risks of hypotension and syncope in patients with pre-existing conditions that predispose to hypotension. Patients who experience pre-syncope should immediately lie supine and promptly seek medical help if the symptoms do not resolve. Prompt medical attention should also be obtained for patients who experience syncope. Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 5.5 Syncope and Hypotension in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The use of ADDYI in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment significantly increases flibanserin concentrations, which can lead to hypotension and syncope. Therefore, the use of ADDYI is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, reactions consistent with angioedema (e.g., swelling of the face, lips, and mouth), pruritus, and urticaria have been reported with ADDYI. ADDYI is contraindicated in women with known hypersensitivity to ADDYI or any of its components [see . Immediately discontinue ADDYI and initiate appropriate treatment if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs. ] Adverse Reactions (6.2) 5.7 Mammary Tumors in Female Mice In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice, there was a statistically significant and dose-related increase in the incidence of malignant mammary tumors in female mice at exposures 3 and 10 times the recommended clinical dose. No such increases were seen in male mice or in male or female rats [see . The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]",

The approved 100 mg ADDYI dosage at bedtime was administered to 2,997 premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD in clinical trials, of whom 1672 received treatment for at least 6 months, 850 received treatment for at least 12 months, and 88 received treatment for at least 18 months [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Data from Five 24-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials in Premenopausal Women with HSDD The data presented below are derived from five 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in premenopausal women with acquired, generalized HSDD. In these five trials, the frequency and quantity of alcohol use was not recorded. Three of these trials (Studies 1 through 3) also provided efficacy data [see One of these trials (Study 5) did not evaluate the 100 mg bedtime dose. Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. In four trials, 100 mg ADDYI at bedtime was administered to 1543 premenopausal women with HSDD, of whom 1060 completed 24 weeks of treatment. The clinical trial population was generally healthy without significant comorbid medical conditions or concomitant medications. The age range was 18-56 years old with a mean age of 36 years old, and 88% were Caucasian and 9% were Black. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 0.9% and 0.5% of ADDYI-treated patients and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 13% among patients treated with 100 mg ADDYI at bedtime and 6% among patients treated with placebo. Table 1 displays the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in four trials of premenopausal women with HSDD. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of ≥1% of patients receiving 100 mg ADDYI at bedtime and at a higher incidence than placebo-treated patients.

Common Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients receiving 100 mg ADDYI at bedtime and at a higher incidence than placebo-treated patients. in Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trials in Premenopausal Women with HSDD Placebo (N=1556) ADDYI (N=1543) Dizziness 2.2% 11.4% Somnolence 2.9% 11.2% Nausea 3.9% 10.4% Fatigue 5.5% 9.2% Insomnia 2.8% 4.9% Dry mouth 1.0% 2.4% Less Common Adverse Reactions In four trials in premenopausal women with HSDD treated with 100 mg ADDYI at bedtime, less common adverse reactions (reported in ≥1% but <2% of ADDYI-treated patients and at a higher incidence than with placebo) included: • Anxiety (ADDYI 1.8%; placebo 1.0%), • Constipation (ADDYI 1.6%; placebo 0.4%), • Abdominal pain (ADDYI 1.5%; placebo 0.9%), • Metrorrhagia (ADDYI 1.4%; placebo 1.4%), • Rash (ADDYI 1.3%; placebo 0.8%), • Sedation (ADDYI 1.3%; placebo 0.2%), and • Vertigo (ADDYI 1%; placebo 0.3%). Appendicitis In the five trials of premenopausal women with HSDD, appendicitis was reported in 6/3973 (0.2%) flibanserin-treated patients, while there were no reports of appendicitis in the 1905 placebo-treated patients. Accidental Injury In five trials of premenopausal women with HSDD, accidental injury was reported in 42/1543 (2.7%) ADDYI-treated patients and 47/1905 (2.5%) placebo-treated patients. Among these 89 patients who experienced injuries, 9/42 (21%) ADDYI-treated patients and 3/47 (6%) placebo-treated patients reported adverse reactions consistent with CNS depression (e.g., somnolence, fatigue, or sedation) within the preceding 24 hours. Adverse Reactions in Patients Who Reported Hormonal Contraceptive Use In four trials of premenopausal women with HSDD, 1466 patients (43%) reported concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives (HC) at study enrollment. These trials were not prospectively designed to assess an interaction between ADDYI and HC. ADDYI-treated patients who reported HC use had a greater incidence of dizziness, somnolence, and fatigue compared to ADDYI-treated patients who did not report HC use (dizziness 9.9% in HC non-users, 13.4% in HC users; somnolence 10.6% in HC non-users, 12.3% in HC users; fatigue 7.5% in HC non-users, 11.4% in HC users). There were no meaningful differences in the incidence of these adverse reactions in placebo-treated patients who reported or did not report HC use [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Data from Other Trials One death occurred in a 54 year-old postmenopausal woman treated with 100 mg ADDYI taken at bedtime (ADDYI is not approved for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HSDD) [see . This patient had a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and baseline alcohol consumption of 1-3 drinks daily. She died of acute alcohol intoxication 14 days after starting ADDYI. Blood alcohol concentration on autopsy was 0.289 g/dL. The autopsy report also noted coronary artery disease. A relationship between this patient’s death and use of ADDYI is unknown Indications and Usage (1) ] [see . Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypotension, Syncope, and CNS Depression in Studies of Healthy Subjects Hypotension, Syncope, and CNS Depression with Alcohol Alcohol and ADDYI Administration at the Same Time The first alcohol interaction study was conducted in 25 healthy subjects (23 men and 2 premenopausal women). The study excluded subjects who drank fewer than five alcoholic drinks per week and those with a history of orthostatic hypotension, or syncope. A single dose of 100 mg ADDYI was administered concurrently with 0.4 g/kg or 0.8 g/kg alcohol in the morning; alcohol was consumed over 10 minutes. Hypotension or syncope requiring therapeutic intervention (ammonia salts and/or placement in supine or Trendelenberg position) occurred in 4 (17%) of the 23 subjects co-administered 100 mg ADDYI and 0.4 g/kg alcohol (equivalent to two 12 ounce cans of beer containing 5% alcohol content, two 5 ounce glasses of wine containing 12% alcohol content, or two 1.5 ounce shots of 80-proof spirit in a 70 kg person). In these four subjects, all of whom were men, the magnitude of the systolic blood pressure reductions ranged from 28 to 54 mmHg and the magnitude of the diastolic blood pressure reductions ranged from 24 to 46 mmHg. In addition, 6 (25%) of the 24 subjects co-administered 100 mg ADDYI and 0.8 g/kg alcohol (equivalent to four 12 ounce cans of beer containing 5% alcohol content, four 5 ounce glasses of wine containing 12% alcohol content, or four 1.5 ounce shots of 80-proof spirit in a 70 kg person) experienced orthostatic hypotension when standing from a sitting position. The magnitude of the systolic blood pressure reduction in these 6 subjects ranged from 22 to 48 mmHg, and the diastolic blood pressure reductions ranged from 0 to 27 mmHg. One of these subjects required therapeutic intervention (ammonia salts and placement supine with the foot of the bed elevated). There were no events requiring therapeutic interventions when ADDYI or alcohol were administered alone. In this study, somnolence was reported in 67%, 74%, and 92% of subjects who received ADDYI alone, ADDYI in combination with 0.4 g/kg alcohol, and ADDYI in combination with 0.8 g/kg alcohol, respectively. [ see ]. Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3 and 5.4) In the second alcohol interaction study, 96 healthy premenopausal women received a single dose of 100 mg ADDYI concurrently with 0.2 g/kg, 0.4 g/kg, or 0.6 g/kg alcohol (equivalent to one, two or three alcoholic drinks in a 70 kg person, respectively) in the morning. The study excluded subjects with a history of syncope, orthostatic hypotension, hypotensive events, and dizziness, and those with a resting systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg. In this study, no subjects experienced syncope or hypotension requiring therapeutic intervention. However, subjects who were already hypotensive (blood pressure below 90/60 mmHg) or symptomatic (e.g., dizzy) while in the semi-recumbent position were not permitted to stand for orthostatic measurements, and those with blood pressures below 90/40 mmHg while in the semi-recumbent position had blood pressures repeated until it was deemed safe for them to change position. More subjects had missing or delayed orthostatic measurements (in general, due to hypotension or dizziness) when receiving ADDYI and alcohol, compared to those who received alcohol alone or ADDYI alone. This pattern of missing or delayed orthostatic measurements is concerning for a risk of hypotension and syncope if those subjects had been allowed to stand. In this study, somnolence was reported in 81-89% of subjects administered ADDYI with alcohol, compared to 25-41% of subjects administered alcohol alone and 84% of subjects taking ADDYI alone. Dizziness was reported in 27-40% of subjects administered ADDYI with alcohol, compared to 6-20% of subjects administered alcohol alone and 31% of subjects taking ADDYI alone. [ see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.3 , 5.4) Alcohol Use at Various Time Intervals Before ADDYI Administration In a third alcohol interaction study, 64 healthy premenopausal women consumed 0.4 g/kg alcohol (equivalent to 2 alcoholic drinks in a 70 kg person) two, four or six hours prior to receiving ADDYI 100 mg or placebo in the afternoon. The study excluded subjects with a history or presence of orthostatic hypotension, history of hypotension, syncope, or dizziness. Prior to receiving alcohol, the subjects in the ADDYI arm had taken ADDYI for three days to achieve steady state. Syncope occurred in one subject who received alcohol alone. The incidences of orthostatic hypotension and hypotension (blood pressure below 90/60 mmHg) at all time points were similar among subjects administered alcohol before ADDYI, subjects administered alcohol alone, and subjects administered ADDYI alone. Three subjects were unable to stand due to feeling dizzy or hypotension; two following alcohol and ADDYI separated by 2 and 6 hours, and one subject who received ADDYI alone. In this study, somnolence was reported in 35-53% of subjects administered ADDYI and alcohol, compared to 5-8% of subjects taking alcohol alone and 50% of subjects taking ADDYI alone. Dizziness was reported in 5-13% of subjects administered ADDYI and alcohol, compared to 0-3% of subjects taking alcohol alone and 12% of subjects taking ADDYI alone. Alcohol Use in the Evening Before Bedtime ADDYI Administration In another alcohol interaction study, 24 premenopausal women consumed 0.4 g/kg alcohol (equivalent to 2 alcoholic drinks in a 70 kg person) during the evening meal two and a half to four hours prior to taking ADDYI 100 mg at bedtime. There were no cases of syncope. Upon rising the following morning, the incidence of hypotension was 23% among subjects administered ADDYI after alcohol, 23% among subjects administered alcohol alone and 36% with ADDYI alone. No cases of somnolence or dizziness were reported in this study. Conclusions are limited because blood pressure and orthostatic measurements were not taken after ADDYI administration until the following morning. Hypotension and Syncope with Fluconazole In a pharmacokinetic drug interaction study of 100 mg ADDYI and 200 mg fluconazole (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, and a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor) in healthy subjects, hypotension or syncope requiring placement supine with legs elevated occurred in 3/15 (20%) subjects treated with concomitant ADDYI and fluconazole compared to no such adverse reactions in subjects treated with ADDYI alone or fluconazole alone. One of these 3 subjects became unresponsive with a blood pressure of 64/41 mm Hg and required transportation to the hospital emergency department where she required intravenous saline. Due to these adverse reactions, the study was stopped. In this study, the concomitant use of ADDYI and fluconazole increased flibanserin exposure 7-fold [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Syncope with Ketoconazole In a pharmacokinetic drug interaction study of 50 mg flibanserin and 400 mg ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, syncope occurred in 1/24 (4%) healthy subjects treated with concomitant flibanserin and ketoconazole, 1/24 (4%) receiving flibanserin alone, and no subjects receiving ketoconazole alone. In this study, the concomitant use of flibanserin and ketoconazole increased flibanserin exposure 4.5-fold [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Syncope in Poor CYP2C19 Metabolizers In a pharmacogenomic study of 100 mg ADDYI in subjects who were poor or extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers, syncope occurred in 1/9 (11%) subjects who were CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (this subject had a 3.2 fold higher flibanserin exposure compared to CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers) compared to no such adverse reactions in subjects who were CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers [see Drug Interactions (7) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval of ADDYI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, reactions consistent with angioedema (e.g., swelling of the face, lips, and mouth), pruritus, and urticaria."
