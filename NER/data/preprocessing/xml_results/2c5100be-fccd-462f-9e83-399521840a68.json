    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions (including shock) have been observed. Discontinue Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection and administer appropriate treatment. ( 5.1 ) • Hematological Effects: Isolated cases of acute intravascular hemolysis, hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinuria have been reported. Monitor rate of hemolysis. Discontinue if severe. ( 5.2 ) • Hepatic Effects: Abnormalities in liver tests; isolated cases of hepatic impairment, hepatitis, and hepatic failure have been observed. Monitor hepatic function. Discontinue if severe dysfunction occurs. ( 5.3 ) • Renal Effects: Elevations in BUN and creatinine; isolated cases of renal impairment or acute renal failure have been reported. Monitor renal function. ( 5.4 ) • Infusion and Injection Site Reactions can occur including rash, pruritus, facial swelling, and vasodilatation. Monitor infusion closely, slow infusion rate if necessary. ( 2.5 , 5.5 ) • High Sodium Load: Each 50, 100, and 150 mL Galaxy container contains 200, 400, and 600 mg of sodium, respectively.  Avoid use in patients with congestive heart failure, elderly patients, and patients requiring restricted sodium intake. ( 5.6 , 8.5 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Isolated cases of serious hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid) reactions (including shock) have been reported in patients receiving micafungin for injection. If these reactions occur, Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection infusion should be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered. 5.2 Hematological Effects Acute intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria was seen in a healthy volunteer during infusion of micafungin for injection (200 mg) and oral prednisolone (20 mg). Cases of significant hemolysis and hemolytic anemia have also been reported in patients treated with micafungin for injection. Patients who develop clinical or laboratory evidence of hemolysis or hemolytic anemia during Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection therapy should be monitored closely for evidence of worsening of these conditions and evaluated for the risk/benefit of continuing Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection therapy. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Laboratory abnormalities in liver function tests have been seen in healthy volunteers and patients treated with micafungin. In some patients with serious underlying conditions who were receiving micafungin along with multiple concomitant medications, clinical hepatic abnormalities have occurred, and isolated cases of significant hepatic impairment, hepatitis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for the risk/benefit of continuing Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection therapy. 5.4 Renal Effects Elevations in BUN and creatinine, and isolated cases of significant renal impairment or acute renal failure have been reported in patients who received micafungin for injection. In fluconazole-controlled trials, the incidence of drug-related renal adverse reactions was 0.4% for micafungin for injection-treated patients and 0.5% for fluconazole-treated patients. Patients who develop abnormal renal function tests during Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening renal function. 5.5 Infusion and Injection Site Reactions Possible histamine-mediated symptoms have been reported with micafungin for injection, including rash, pruritus, facial swelling, and vasodilatation. Slow the infusion rate if infusion reaction occurs [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Injection site reactions, including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis have been reported, at micafungin for injection doses of 50 to 150 mg/day. These reactions tended to occur more often in patients receiving micafungin for injection via peripheral intravenous administration [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 High Sodium Load Each 50 mg/50 mL Galaxy container of Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection contains 200 mg of sodium, each 100 mg/100 mL Galaxy container of Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection contains 400 mg of sodium, and each 150 mg/150 mL Galaxy container of Micafungin in Sodium Chloride Injection contains 600 mg of sodium.

The overall safety of micafungin for injection was assessed in 520 healthy volunteers and 3417 adult and pediatric patients who received single or multiple doses of micafungin for injection across 50 clinical trials, including the invasive candidiasis, esophageal candidiasis and prophylaxis trials. The doses of micafungin for injection administered included doses above and below the recommended doses [ and ranged from 0.75 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg in pediatric patients and 12.5 mg to 150 mg/day or greater in adults. see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 )] Clinical Trials Experience in Adults In clinical trials with micafungin for injection, 2497/2748 (91%) adult patients experienced at least one adverse reaction. Candidemia and Other Candida Infections In a randomized, double-blind trial for the treatment of candidemia and other Candida infections, adverse reactions occurred in 183/200 (92%) and 171/193 (89%) patients in the micafungin for injection 100 mg/day, and caspofungin (70 mg loading dose followed by 50 mg/day dose) treatment groups, respectively. Selected adverse reactions occurring in 5% or more of the patients and more frequently in the micafungin for injection treatment group, are shown in Table 3 . Table 3. Selected During IV Treatment + 3 days.

Prophylaxis of Candida Infections in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients A double-blind trial was conducted in a total of 882 patients scheduled to undergo an autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The median duration of treatment was 18 days (range 1 to 51 days) in both treatment arms. All adult patients who received micafungin for injection (382) or fluconazole (409) experienced at least one adverse reaction during the study. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions resulting in micafungin for injection discontinuation were reported in 15 (4%) adult patients; while those resulting in fluconazole discontinuation were reported in 32 (8%). Selected adverse reactions reported in 15% or more of adult patients and more frequently in the micafungin for injection treatment arm, are shown in Table 5 . Table 5.

Other selected adverse reactions reported at less than 5% in adult clinical trials are listed below: • Blood and lymphatic system disorders: coagulopathy, pancytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura • Cardiac disorders: cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion • General disorders and administration site conditions: infusion reaction, injection site thrombosis • Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatocellular damage, hepatomegaly, jaundice, hepatic failure • Immune disorders: hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction • Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hypernatremia, hypokalemia • Nervous system disorders: convulsions, encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage • Psychiatric disorders: delirium • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients The safety of micafungin for injection was assessed in 593 pediatric patients, 425 of whom were 4 months through 16 years of age and 168 of whom were 3 days to less than 4 months of age who received at least one dose of micafungin for injection across 15 clinical trials. Of the 425 pediatric patients, 4 months through 16 years of age enrolled in 11 clinical trials, 235 (55%) were male, 290 (68%) were white, with the following age distribution: 62 (15%) 4 months to <2 years, 108 (25%) 2 to 5 years, 140 (33%) 6 to 11 years, and 115 (27%) 12 to 16 years of age. The mean treatment duration was 26.1 days. A total of 246 patients received at least one dose of micafungin for injection ranging from 2 to 10 mg/kg. Overall, 388/425 (91%) patients experienced at least one adverse reaction. Adverse reactions occurring in ≥15% or more of micafungin-treated pediatric patients 4 months of age and older are: vomiting (32%), diarrhea (24%), pyrexia (24%), hypokalemia (22%), nausea (21%), mucosal inflammation (19%), thrombocytopenia (19%), abdominal pain (18%), headache (15%), and hypertension (15%). Two randomized, double-blind active-controlled trials included pediatric patients. In the invasive candidiasis/candidemia trial, the efficacy and safety of micafungin for injection (2 mg/kg/day for patients weighing 40 kg or less and 100 mg/day for patients weighing greater than 40 kg) was compared to amphotericin B liposome (3 mg/kg/day) in 112 pediatric patients. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurred in 51/56 (91%) of patients in the micafungin for injection group and 52/56 (93%) of patients in the amphotericin B liposome group. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions resulting in drug discontinuation were reported in 2 (4%) micafungin for injection-treated pediatric patients and in 9 (16%) amphotericin B liposome-treated pediatric patients. The prophylaxis study in patients undergoing HSCT investigated the efficacy of micafungin for injection (1 mg/kg/day for patients weighing 50 kg or less and 50 mg/day for patients weighing greater than 50 kg) as compared to fluconazole (8 mg/kg/day for patients weighing 50 kg or less and 400 mg/day for patients weighing greater than 50 kg). All 91 pediatric patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse reaction. Three (7%) pediatric patients discontinued micafungin for injection due to adverse reaction, while one (2%) patient discontinued fluconazole. Selected adverse reactions, occurring in 15% or more of the patients and more frequently in a micafungin for injection group, for the two comparative trials are shown in Table 6 . Table 6. Selected Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Candidemia and Other Candida Infections (C/IC), and in Hematopoietic Stem-Cell Recipients During Prophylaxis of Candida Infections Adverse Reactions Within a system organ class, patients may experience more than 1 adverse reaction. C/IC Study population included 20 pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age (10 in each arm).

The mean treatment duration was 16.6 days. A total of 59 patients received micafungin for injection at doses ≤4 mg/kg/day and 109 patients received micafungin for injection doses >4 mg/kg/day [5 to 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.3 to 3.8 times the recommended dosage in pediatric patients less than 4 months old)]. The adverse reaction profile of micafungin for injection in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age was generally comparable to that of pediatric patients 4 months of age and older and adults. The most frequent adverse reactions (≥15%) in pediatric patients younger than 4 months old receiving a micafungin for injection dose of approximately 4 mg/kg/day included hypokalemia (25%), thrombocytopenia (25%), acidosis (20%), sepsis (20%), anemia (15%), oxygen saturation decreased (15%), and vomiting (15%). No new safety signals were seen in patients who received 5 to 15 mg/kg/day [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Additional clinically significant adverse reactions reported in less than 15% of pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age who received approximately 4 mg/kg/day are listed below: • Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, coagulation disorder neonatal • Gastrointestinal Disorders: hematochezia, intestinal perforation, ascites, ileus, intestinal infarction, diarrhea, abdominal distension • General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: peripheral swelling, generalized edema, pyrexia, infusion site extravasation, edema neonatal • Hepatobiliary Disorders: hyperbilirubinemia • Investigations: blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood urea increased, ECG QRS complex prolonged • Vascular Disorders: neonatal hypotension, thrombophlebitis • Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: hypertonia neonatal • Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pleural effusion, respiratory failure, neonatal aspiration, respiratory distress • Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hyperglycemia, dehydration, hypocalcemia, hypermagnesemia 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of micafungin for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. • Blood and lymphatic system disorders: disseminated intravascular coagulation • Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic disorder • Renal and urinary disorders: renal impairment • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis • Vascular disorders: shock"
