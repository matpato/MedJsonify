    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE EVENITY is a sclerostin inhibitor indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use: Limit duration of use to 12 monthly doses. If osteoporosis therapy remains warranted, continued therapy with an anti-resorptive agent should be considered. ( 1.2 ) 1.1\tTreatment of Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk for Fracture EVENITY is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, or multiple risk factors for fracture; or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. 1.2\tLimitations of Use The anabolic effect of EVENITY wanes after 12 monthly doses of therapy. Therefore, the duration of EVENITY use should be limited to 12 monthly doses. If osteoporosis therapy remains warranted, continued therapy with an anti-resorptive agent should be considered [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS EVENITY is contraindicated in patients with: Hypocalcemia. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with EVENITY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ].

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE): Monitor for symptoms of MI and stroke and seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, dermatitis, rash, and urticaria. Discontinue EVENITY if a clinically significant allergic reaction occurs. ( 5.2 ) Hypocalcemia: Adequately supplement calcium and vitamin D during treatment with EVENITY. ( 5.3 ) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Monitor for symptoms. Consider discontinuation of therapy based on benefit-risk assessment. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femoral Fracture: Evaluate new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. ( 5.5 ) 5.1\tMajor Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) In a randomized controlled trial in postmenopausal women, there was a higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, in patients treated with EVENITY compared to those treated with alendronate [see . Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] EVENITY should not be initiated in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke within the preceding year. Consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Monitor for signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction and stroke and instruct patients to seek prompt medical attention if symptoms occur. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy, EVENITY should be discontinued. 5.2\tHypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, dermatitis, rash, and urticaria have occurred in EVENITY-treated patients. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue further use of EVENITY [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.3\tHypocalcemia Hypocalcemia has occurred in patients receiving EVENITY. Correct hypocalcemia prior to initiating EVENITY [see . Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D while on EVENITY [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) or receiving dialysis are at greater risk of developing hypocalcemia. Monitor serum calcium and adequately supplement patients who have severe renal impairment or are receiving dialysis with calcium and vitamin D. Instruct patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis, about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of maintaining calcium levels with adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation. 5.4\tOsteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients receiving EVENITY. A routine oral examination should be performed by the prescriber prior to initiation of EVENITY treatment. Concomitant administration of drugs associated with ONJ (chemotherapy, bisphosphonates, denosumab, angiogenesis inhibitors, and corticosteroids) may increase the risk of developing ONJ. Other risk factors for ONJ include cancer, radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, pre-existing dental disease or infection, anemia, and coagulopathy [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on benefit-risk assessment. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on EVENITY should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. In these patients, dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of EVENITY should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment. 5.5\tAtypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical low-energy or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in patients receiving EVENITY [see . These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. During EVENITY treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain. Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of EVENITY therapy should be considered based on benefit-risk assessment [see Clinical Studies (14) ].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Major adverse cardiac events [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypocalcemia [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Osteonecrosis of the Jaw [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) reported with EVENITY in clinical trials were arthralgia and headache.

The safety of EVENITY for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1, NCT01575834) of 7180 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 71 years). A total of 3581 and 3576 women received at least one dose of EVENITY and placebo, respectively, administered once every month during the 12-month double-blind study period. Women received at least 500 mg calcium and 600 international units of vitamin D supplementation daily and 77% received a loading dose of 50,000 to 60,000 international units of vitamin D within one week of randomization (if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were 40 ng/mL or less). The safety of EVENITY for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at high risk of fracture was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study (Study 2, NCT01631214) of 4093 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 74 years). A total of 2040 and 2014 women received at least one dose of EVENITY and alendronate, respectively, during the 12-month double-blind study period. Women received at least 500 mg calcium and 600 international units vitamin D supplementation daily and 74% received a loading dose of 50,000 to 60,000 international units of vitamin D within one week of randomization (if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were 40 ng/mL or less). In Study 1, during the 12-month double-blind treatment period, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 0.7% (24/3576) in the placebo group and 0.8% (29/3581) in the EVENITY group. The incidence of nonfatal serious adverse events was 8.3% in the placebo group and 9.1% in the EVENITY group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.1% in the placebo group and 1.1% in the EVENITY group. The most common adverse reactions reported with EVENITY (greater than or equal to 5% and at a higher incidence than placebo) were arthralgia and headache. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of EVENITY was arthralgia (6 subjects [0.2%] in the placebo group and 5 subjects [0.1%] in the EVENITY group). In Study 2, during the 12-month double-blind treatment period, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 1.1% (22/2014) in the alendronate group and 1.5% (30/2040) in the EVENITY group. The incidence of nonfatal serious adverse events was 13.3% in the alendronate group and 11.9% in the EVENITY group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse events was 1.2% in the alendronate group and 1.2% in the EVENITY group. The most common adverse reactions reported with EVENITY (greater than or equal to 5%) were arthralgia and headache. Table 1 outlines the most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than or equal to 2% of EVENITY treated women in at least one study.

Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) During the 12-month double-blind treatment period of the placebo-controlled trial (Study 1), myocardial infarction occurred in 9 (0.3%) women in the EVENITY group and 8 (0.2%) women in the placebo group; stroke occurred in 8 (0.2%) women in the EVENITY group and 10 (0.3%) women in the placebo group . These events occurred in patients with and without a history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Cardiovascular death occurred in 17 (0.5%) women in the EVENITY group and 15 (0.4%) women in the placebo group. The number of women with positively adjudicated MACE was 30 (0.8%) in the EVENITY group and 29 (0.8%) in the placebo group, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.03 (95% confidence interval [0.62, 1.72]) for EVENITY compared to placebo. During the 12-month double-blind treatment period of the active-controlled trial (Study 2), myocardial infarction occurred in 16 (0.8%) women in the EVENITY group and 5 (0.2%) women in the alendronate group; stroke occurred in 13 (0.6%) women in the EVENITY group and 7 (0.3%) women in the alendronate group. These events occurred in patients with and without a history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Cardiovascular death occurred in 17 (0.8%) women in the EVENITY group and 12 (0.6%) women in the alendronate group. The number of women with positively adjudicated MACE was 41 (2.0%) in the EVENITY group and 22 (1.1%) in the alendronate group, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.87 (95% confidence interval [1.11, 3.14]) for EVENITY compared to alendronate [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Across both trials, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 364 (6.5%) women in the EVENITY group and 365 (6.5%) women in the control group. Reported reactions included angioedema (3 [< 0.1%] women in the EVENITY group vs. 3 [< 0.1%] women in the control group), erythema multiforme (1 [< 0.1%] woman in the EVENITY group vs. no woman in the control group), dermatitis (32 [0.6%] women in the EVENITY group vs. 42 [0.8%] women in the control group), rash (60 [1.1%] women in the EVENITY group vs. 53 [0.9%] women in the control group), and urticaria (23 [0.4%] women in the EVENITY group vs. 27 [0.5%] women in the control group). Although angioedema, dermatitis and urticaria were not reported at a higher incidence with EVENITY than control, there were cases of angioedema, dermatitis and urticaria that were determined to be related to EVENITY use [see . Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypocalcemia Across both trials, adverse events of hypocalcemia occurred in 2 EVENITY-treated women and in 1 woman in the control group. Decreases in albumin-adjusted serum calcium to below the lower limit of the reference range (8.3 mg/dL) were reported in 14 (0.2%) women in the EVENITY group and 10 (0.2%) women in the control group. No patient receiving EVENITY developed serum calcium less than 7.5 mg/dL. The nadir in albumin-adjusted serum calcium occurred by month 1 after EVENITY dosing in patients with normal renal function [see . Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Injection Site Reactions Across both trials, injection site reactions occurred in 278 (4.9%) women in the EVENITY group and 157 (2.8%) women in the control group. The most common injection site reactions were pain (94 [1.7%] women in the EVENITY group; 70 [1.3%] women in the control group) and erythema (80 [1.4%] women in the EVENITY group and 14 [0.3%] women in the control group). Injection site reactions resulted in discontinuation of treatment in 7 (0.1%) EVENITY-treated patients and 3 (< 0.1%) patients in the control group. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Across both trials, osteonecrosis of the jaw occurred in one patient during treatment with EVENITY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fractures Across both trials, atypical femoral fracture occurred in one patient during treatment with EVENITY [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 6.2\tImmunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other romosozumab products may be misleading. The immunogenicity of EVENITY was evaluated using an immunoassay for the detection of anti-romosozumab-aqqg antibodies. An in vitro biological assay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for those subjects whose sera tested positive for anti-romosozumab-aqqg antibodies. Among 5914 postmenopausal women treated with EVENITY 210 mg monthly, 18.1% of subjects developed antibodies to romosozumab-aqqg. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to romosozumab-aqqg, 4.7% had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Development of antibodies to romosozumab-aqqg was associated with lower serum romosozumab-aqqg concentrations [see . Antibodies to romosozumab-aqqg were generally not associated with changes in the efficacy or safety of EVENITY. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]"
