    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of AIMOVIG and initiate appropriate therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur within hours to more than one week after administration. ( 5.1 ) Constipation with Serious Complications: Serious complications of constipation may occur. ( 5.2 ) Hypertension: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension may occur. ( 5.3 ) Raynaud's Phenomenon: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon may occur. ( 5.4 ) 5.1\tHypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, have been reported with AIMOVIG in postmarketing experience. Most hypersensitivity reactions were not serious and occurred within hours of administration, although some occurred more than one week after administration. If a serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of AIMOVIG and initiate appropriate therapy [see . Contraindications (4) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.2\tConstipation with Serious Complications Constipation with serious complications has been reported following the use of AIMOVIG in the postmarketing setting. There were cases that required hospitalization, including cases where surgery was necessary. In a majority of these cases, the onset of constipation was reported after the first dose of AIMOVIG; however, patients have also presented with constipation later on in treatment. AIMOVIG was discontinued in most reported cases of constipation with serious complications. Constipation was one of the most common (up to 3%) adverse reactions reported in clinical studies [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Monitor patients treated with AIMOVIG for severe constipation and manage as clinically appropriate [see . The concurrent use of medications associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may increase the risk for more severe constipation and the potential for constipation-related complications. Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.3\tHypertension Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of AIMOVIG in the postmarketing setting. Many of the patients had pre-existing hypertension or risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring pharmacological treatment and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment but was most frequently reported within seven days of dose administration. In the majority of the cases, the onset or worsening of hypertension was reported after the first dose. AIMOVIG was discontinued in many of the reported cases. Monitor patients treated with AIMOVIG for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of AIMOVIG is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology. 5.4\tRaynaud's Phenomenon Development of Raynaud's phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including AIMOVIG. In reported cases with monoclonal antibody CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 71 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms. AIMOVIG should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud's phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Constipation with Serious Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Raynaud's Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions in AIMOVIG clinical studies (occurring in at least 3% of treated patients and more often than placebo) are injection site reactions and constipation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Medical Information at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of AIMOVIG has been evaluated in 2537 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of AIMOVIG, representing 3040.2 patient-years of exposure. Of these, 2271 patients were exposed to 70 mg or 140 mg once monthly for at least 6 months, 1305 patients were exposed for at least 12 months, and 216 patients were exposed through 5 years. In placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3) of 2184 patients, 787 patients received at least one dose of AIMOVIG 70 mg once monthly, 507 patients received at least one dose of AIMOVIG 140 mg once monthly, and 890 patients received placebo during 3 months or 6 months of double-blind treatment [see . Approximately 84% were female, 91% were white, and the mean age was 42 years at study entry. Clinical Studies (14) ] The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 3% and more often than placebo) in the migraine studies were injection site reactions and constipation. Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred during the first 3 months in the migraine studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring with an Incidence of at Least 2% for Either Dose of AIMOVIG and at Least 2% Greater than Placebo During the First 3 Months in Studies 1, 2, and 3 Adverse Reaction AIMOVIG 70 mg Once Monthly N = 787 % AIMOVIG 140 mg Once Monthly N = 507 % Placebo N = 890 % Injection site reactions Injection site reactions include multiple adverse reactions related terms, such as injection site pain and injection site erythema. , The rate of injection site reactions reported in Table 1 is with the prefilled syringe. 6 5 3 Constipation 1 3 1 Cramps, muscle spasms < 1 2 < 1 In Studies 1, 2, and 3, 1.3% of patients treated with AIMOVIG 70 mg or 140 mg discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events. The most frequent injection site reactions were injection site pain, injection site erythema, and injection site pruritus. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of AIMOVIG. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, angioedema, and anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Constipation with serious complications [see , oral mucosal ulceration Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash, alopecia. Vascular Disorders: Hypertension [see , Raynaud's Phenomenon Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]."
