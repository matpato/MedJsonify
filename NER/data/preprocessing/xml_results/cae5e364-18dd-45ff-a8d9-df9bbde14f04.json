    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection before initiation of HCV treatment. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for HBV reactivation and hepatitis flare during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Hepatic Decompensation/Failure in Patients with Evidence of Advanced Liver Disease: Hepatic decompensation/failure, including fatal outcomes, have been reported mostly in patients with cirrhosis and baseline moderate or severe liver impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). Monitor for clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic decompensation. Discontinue MAVYRET in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation/failure. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Risk of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation in Patients Coinfected with HCV and HBV Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals, and who were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death. Cases have been reported in patients who are HBsAg positive and also in patients with serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection (i.e., HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive). HBV reactivation has also been reported in patients receiving certain immunosuppressant or chemotherapeutic agents; the risk of HBV reactivation associated with treatment with HCV direct-acting antivirals may be increased in these patients. HBV reactivation is characterized as an abrupt increase in HBV replication manifesting as a rapid increase in serum HBV DNA level. In patients with resolved HBV infection reappearance of HBsAg can occur. Reactivation of HBV replication may be accompanied by hepatitis, i.e., increase in aminotransferase levels and, in severe cases, increases in bilirubin levels, liver failure, and death can occur. Test all patients for evidence of current or prior HBV infection by measuring HBsAg and anti- HBc before initiating HCV treatment with MAVYRET. In patients with serologic evidence of HBV infection, monitor for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment with MAVYRET and during post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated. 5.2 Risk of Hepatic Decompensation/Failure in Patients with Evidence of Advanced Liver Disease Postmarketing cases of hepatic decompensation/failure, including those with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients treated with HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens, including MAVYRET. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The majority of patients with severe outcomes had evidence of advanced liver disease with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) prior to initiating therapy with MAVYRET, including some patients reported as having compensated cirrhosis with mild liver impairment (Child-Pugh A) at baseline but with a prior decompensation event (i.e., prior history of ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy). Rare cases of hepatic decompensation/failure were reported in patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A); many of these patients had evidence of portal hypertension. Events also occurred in patients taking a concomitant medication not recommended for coadministration, or in patients with confounding factors such as serious liver-related medical or surgical comorbidities. Cases typically occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment (median of 27 days). In patients with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) or evidence of advanced liver disease such as portal hypertension, perform hepatic laboratory testing as clinically indicated; and monitor for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation such as the presence of jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. Discontinue MAVYRET in patients who develop evidence of hepatic decompensation/failure. MAVYRET is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) or those with any history of prior hepatic decompensation [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.3 Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Concomitant Use of MAVYRET with Carbamazepine, Efavirenz Containing Regimens, or St. John’s Wort Carbamazepine, efavirenz, and St. John’s wort may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of MAVYRET. The use of these agents with MAVYRET is not recommended.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS In subjects receiving MAVYRET, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 10%) are headache and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie Inc. at 1-800-633-9110 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of MAVYRET cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Overall Adverse Reactions in Subjects without Cirrhosis or with Compensated Cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) The adverse reactions data for MAVYRET in subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) were derived from nine registrational Phase 2 and 3 trials which evaluated approximately 2,300 adults infected with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 HCV who received MAVYRET for 8, 12 or 16 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] . The overall proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.1% for subjects who received MAVYRET for 8, 12 or 16 weeks. The most common adverse reactions, all grades, observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving 8, 12, or 16 weeks of treatment with MAVYRET were headache (13%), fatigue (11%), and nausea (8%). In subjects receiving MAVYRET who experienced adverse reactions, 80% had an adverse reaction of mild severity (Grade 1). One subject experienced a serious adverse reaction. Adverse reactions (type and severity) were similar for subjects receiving MAVYRET for 8, 12 or 16 weeks. The type and severity of adverse reactions in subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) were similar to those seen in subjects without cirrhosis. Adverse Reactions in Subjects without Cirrhosis ENDURANCE-2 Among 302 treatment-naïve or PRS treatment-experienced, HCV genotype 2-infected adults without cirrhosis enrolled in ENDURANCE-2, adverse reactions (all intensity) occurring in at least 5% of subjects treated with MAVYRET for 12 weeks are presented in Table 4 . In subjects treated with MAVYRET for 12 weeks, 32% reported an adverse reaction, of which 98% had adverse reactions of mild or moderate severity. No subjects treated with MAVYRET or placebo in ENDURANCE-2 permanently discontinued treatment due to an adverse drug reaction. Table 4.

Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Compensated Cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) The safety of MAVYRET in HCV GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 subjects with compensated cirrhosis is based on data from 288 adults from the Phase 2/3 registrational trials treated with MAVYRET for 12 or more weeks and 343 adults from EXPEDITION-8 treated with MAVYRET for 8 weeks. The adverse reactions observed were generally consistent with those observed in clinical studies of MAVYRET in non-cirrhotic subjects [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . In the Phase 2/3 registrational trials, the adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 5% of compensated cirrhotic subjects (n=288) treated across all durations of MAVYRET were fatigue (15%), headache (14%), nausea (8%), diarrhea (6%), and pruritus (6%). In EXPEDITION-8, the adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 5% of compensated cirrhotic subjects (n=343) were fatigue (8%), pruritus (7%), and headache (6%). No subjects with compensated cirrhosis in the Phase 2/3 registrational trials (without severe renal impairment) or in EXPEDITION-8 discontinued treatment with MAVYRET due to an adverse reaction. Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Severe Renal Impairment Including Those on Dialysis The safety of MAVYRET in subjects with chronic kidney disease (Stage 4 or Stage 5 including subjects on dialysis) with genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) was assessed in 104 adults (EXPEDITION-4) who received MAVYRET for 12 weeks. The most common adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving 12 weeks of treatment with MAVYRET were pruritus (17%), fatigue (12%), nausea (9%), asthenia (7%), and headache (6%). In subjects treated with MAVYRET who reported an adverse reaction, 90% had adverse reactions of mild or moderate severity (Grade 1 or 2). The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 2%. Adverse Reactions in HCV/HIV-1 Co-infected Subjects The safety of MAVYRET in subjects with HIV-1 co-infection with genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) was assessed in 153 adults (EXPEDITION-2) who received MAVYRET for 8 or 12 weeks. Thirty-three subjects with HIV-1 coinfection also received 8 or 12 weeks of therapy in ENDURANCE-1. The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects (ENDURANCE-1 and EXPEDITION-2) was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. Adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving MAVYRET in EXPEDITION-2 for 8 or 12 weeks were fatigue (10%), nausea (8%), and headache (5%). Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Liver or Kidney Transplant The safety of MAVYRET was assessed in 100 adult post-liver or -kidney transplant recipients with genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis (MAGELLAN-2). The overall safety profile in transplant recipients was similar to that observed in subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 studies, without a history of transplantation. Adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving MAVYRET for 12 weeks were headache (17%), fatigue (16%), nausea (8%) and pruritus (7%). In subjects treated with MAVYRET who reported an adverse reaction, 81% had adverse reactions of mild severity. Two percent of subjects experienced a serious adverse reaction, and no subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. Adverse Reactions in People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) and those on Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for Opioid Use Disorder The safety of MAVYRET in PWID with HCV GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection is based on data from adults and adolescents in Phase 2 and 3 trials in which 62 subjects identified as current/recent PWID (defined as self-reported injection drug use within the last 12 months prior to starting MAVYRET) and 3,282 subjects reported no injection drug use (non-PWID). Among current/recent PWID, adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects were fatigue (16%), headache (13%), diarrhea (6%), and nausea (6%). Among non-PWID subjects, adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% were headache (7%) and fatigue (6%). Serious adverse reactions and/or adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in one current/recent PWID subject (2%) compared to less than 1% in non-PWID subjects [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.9 ) ]. Among 225 subjects reporting concomitant use of MAT for opioid use disorder, adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% were headache (15%), fatigue (12%), nausea (11%), and diarrhea (6%). Among 4,098 subjects who were not on MAT, adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% were headache (9%), fatigue (8%), and nausea (5%).  Serious adverse reactions and/or adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were not observed among subjects on MAT and were experienced by less than 1% of subjects not on MAT [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.9 ) ]. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Subjects 3 Y ears and Older The safety of MAVYRET in HCV GT1, 2, 3, or 4 infected adolescents is based on data from a Phase 2/3 open-label trial in 47 subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years without cirrhosis treated with MAVYRET for 8 or 16 weeks (DORA-Part 1). The adverse reactions observed in subjects 12 years to less than 18 years of age were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of MAVYRET in adults. The only adverse reaction observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving MAVYRET in DORA Part 1 was fatigue (6%). No subjects discontinued or interrupted treatment with MAVYRET due to an adverse reaction. The safety of MAVYRET in HCV GT 1, 2, 3, or 4 infected pediatric subjects aged 3 years to less than 12 years is based on data from a Phase 2/3 open-label trial in 80 subjects aged 3 to less than 12 years without cirrhosis treated with weight-based MAVYRET oral pellets in packets for 8, 12 or 16 weeks (DORA-Part 2). The adverse reactions observed in subjects 3 years to less than 12 years of age were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of MAVYRET in adults with the exception of vomiting (occurring at 8%), rash, and abdominal pain upper (each occurring at 4%) which were observed more frequently in pediatric subjects less than 12 years of age compared to adults. Other adverse reactions observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving MAVYRET in DORA-Part 2 include fatigue and headache, each occurring at 8%. One subject discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction of erythematous rash (Grade 3). All other adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 and no subjects interrupted treatment due to an adverse reaction [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.10 ) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities Serum bilirubin elevations Elevations of total bilirubin at least 2 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 3.5% of adult subjects treated with MAVYRET versus 0% in placebo; these elevations were observed in 1.2% of adult subjects across the Phase 2 and 3 trials. In adult subjects with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), 17% experienced early, transient post-baseline elevations of bilirubin above the upper limit of normal. These bilirubin elevations were typically less than two times the upper limit of normal, generally occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment and resolved with continued treatment. The subjects with compensated cirrhosis and bilirubin elevations did not have concurrent increases in ALT or AST, or signs of liver decompensation or failure, and these laboratory events did not lead to treatment discontinuation. MAVYRET inhibits OATP1B1/3 and is a weak inhibitor of UGT1A1 and may have the potential to impact bilirubin transport and metabolism, including direct and indirect bilirubin. Few subjects experienced jaundice or ocular icterus and total bilirubin levels decreased after completing MAVYRET. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MAVYRET. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
