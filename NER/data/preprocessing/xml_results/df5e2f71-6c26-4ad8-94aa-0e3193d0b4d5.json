    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hemorrhage : CYRAMZA increases the risk of hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including severe and fatal events. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience severe bleeding. ( 5.1 ) Gastrointestinal Perforations : CYRAMZA increases the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, which can be fatal. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a gastrointestinal perforation. ( 5.2 ) Impaired Wound Healing : Withhold CYRAMZA for 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CYRAMZA for at least 2 weeks following a major surgical procedure and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of CYRAMZA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.3 ) Arterial Thromboembolic Events (ATEs) : Serious and sometimes fatal ATEs can occur with CYRAMZA. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience an ATE. ( 5.4 ) Hypertension : Monitor blood pressure and treat hypertension. Withhold CYRAMZA for severe hypertension. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for hypertension that cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy and for hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. ( 5.5 ) Infusion-Related Reactions (IRR) : Monitor for signs and symptoms during infusion. Reduce the infusion rate for Grade 1 or 2 IRR and permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 IRR. ( 5.6 ) Worsening of Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment : New onset or worsening encephalopathy, ascites or hepatorenal syndrome can occur in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis. ( 5.7 ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome : Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA. ( 5.8 ) Proteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome : Monitor for proteinuria. Withhold CYRAMZA for urine protein levels greater than or equal to 2 g per 24 hours. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for urine protein levels greater than 3 g per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome. ( 5.9 ) Thyroid Dysfunction : Monitor thyroid function during treatment. ( 5.10 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.11 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage CYRAMZA increased the risk of hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including Grade ≥3 hemorrhagic events. Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade hemorrhage ranged from 13-55%. Grade 3-5 hemorrhage incidence ranged from 2-5% [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Patients with gastric cancer receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were excluded from enrollment in REGARD and RAINBOW; therefore, the risk of gastric hemorrhage in CYRAMZA-treated patients with gastric tumors receiving NSAIDs is unknown. Patients with NSCLC receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or with evidence of major airway invasion by cancer were excluded from REVEL. In addition, patients with NSCLC with a recent history of gross hemoptysis, those receiving chronic therapy with NSAIDs or other anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin, or with radiographic evidence of major blood vessel invasion or intratumor cavitation were excluded from REVEL and RELAY; therefore, the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage in these groups of patients is unknown. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience severe (Grade 3 or 4) bleeding [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.2 Gastrointestinal Perforations CYRAMZA can increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, a potentially fatal event. Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade and Grade 3-5 gastrointestinal perforations ranged from <1-2% [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience a gastrointestinal perforation [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.3 Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF or VEGFR pathway. CYRAMZA, a VEGFR2 antagonist, has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. CYRAMZA has not been studied in patients with serious or non-healing wounds. Withhold CYRAMZA for 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer CYRAMZA for at least 2 weeks following a major surgical procedure and until adequate wound healing. The  safety of resumption of CYRAMZA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.4 Arterial Thromboembolic Events Serious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs), including myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular accident, and cerebral ischemia, occurred across clinical trials. Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade ATE was 1-3%. Grade 3-5 ATE incidence was <1-2% [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who experience an ATE [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.5 Hypertension An increased incidence of severe hypertension occurred in patients receiving CYRAMZA. Across five clinical studies, excluding RELAY, in 1916 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade hypertension ranged from 11-26%. Grade 3-5 hypertension incidence ranged from 6-15% [see Adverse Reactions ( . In 221 patients with NSCLC receiving CYRAMZA in combination with erlotinib in the RELAY study, the incidence of new or worsening hypertension was higher (45%), as was the incidence of Grade 3-5 hypertension (24%). Of the patients experiencing new or worsening hypertension in RELAY (N=100 CYRAMZA and erlotinib; N=27 placebo and erlotinib), 13% of those treated with CYRAMZA and erlotinib required initiation of 3 or more antihypertensive medications compared to 4% of patients treated with placebo and erlotinib. 6.1 )] Control hypertension prior to initiating treatment with CYRAMZA. Monitor blood pressure every two weeks or more frequently as indicated during treatment. Withhold CYRAMZA for severe hypertension until medically controlled. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for medically significant hypertension that cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy or in patients with hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.6 Infusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions (IRR), including severe and life-threatening IRR, occurred in CYRAMZA clinical trials. The majority of IRR across trials occurred during or following a first or second CYRAMZA infusion. Symptoms of IRR included rigors/tremors, back pain/spasms, chest pain and/or tightness, chills, flushing, dyspnea, wheezing, hypoxia, and paresthesia. In severe cases, symptoms included bronchospasm, supraventricular tachycardia, and hypotension. Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA in which premedication was recommended or required, the incidence of all Grade IRR ranged from <1-9%. Grade 3-5 IRR incidence was <1% [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Premedicate prior to each CYRAMZA infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( . Monitor patients during the infusion for signs and symptoms of IRR in a setting with available resuscitation equipment. Reduce the infusion rate by 50% for Grade 1-2 IRR. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for Grade 3-4 IRR 2.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.7 Worsening of Pre-existing Hepatic Impairment Clinical deterioration, manifested by new onset or worsening encephalopathy, ascites, or hepatorenal syndrome, was reported in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis who received single agent CYRAMZA. Use CYRAMZA in patients with Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis only if the potential benefits of treatment are judged to outweigh the risks of clinical deterioration. Based on safety data from REACH-2, in patients with Child-Pugh A liver cirrhosis, the pooled incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome was higher for patients who received CYRAMZA (6%) compared to patients who received placebo (0%) [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.8 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) (also known as Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [RPLS]) has been reported in <0.1% of 2137 patients enrolled in six clinical studies with CYRAMZA. Symptoms of PRES include seizure, headache, nausea/vomiting, blindness, or altered consciousness, with or without associated hypertension. Confirm the diagnosis of PRES with magnetic resonance imaging and permanently discontinue CYRAMZA in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms may resolve or improve within days, although some patients with PRES can experience ongoing neurologic sequelae or death [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.9 Proteinuria Including Nephrotic Syndrome Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of all Grade proteinuria ranged from 3-34%. Grade ≥3 proteinuria (including 4 patients with nephrotic syndrome) incidence ranged from <1-3% [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Monitor proteinuria by urine dipstick and/or urinary protein creatinine ratio. If the result of the urine dipstick is 2+ or greater, perform a 24-hour urine collection for protein measurement. Withhold CYRAMZA for urine protein levels that are 2 or more grams over 24 hours. Reinitiate CYRAMZA at a reduced dose once the urine protein level returns to less than 2 grams over 24 hours. Permanently discontinue CYRAMZA for urine protein levels greater than 3 grams over 24 hours or in the setting of nephrotic syndrome [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.10 Thyroid Dysfunction Across six clinical studies in 2137 patients with various cancers treated with CYRAMZA, the incidence of Grade 1-2 hypothyroidism ranged from <1-3%; there were no reports of Grade 3-5 hypothyroidism [see Adverse Reactions ( . Monitor thyroid function during treatment with CYRAMZA. 6.1 )] 5.11 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Animal models link angiogenesis, VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryo-fetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CYRAMZA and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.3 )]",

The data described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to CYRAMZA in 2137 patients from six studies: REGARD, RAINBOW, RAISE, REVEL, REACH-2, and RELAY. Gastric Cancer The safety of CYRAMZA was evaluated in REGARD and RAINBOW [see Clinical Studies ( . Patients in both trials had locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (including GEJ adenocarcinoma) and had previously received platinum- or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy. Patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. Both trials excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, or patients receiving chronic anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin. REGARD excluded patients with bilirubin ≥1.5 mg/dL and RAINBOW excluded patients with bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). 14.1 )] CYRAMZA Administered as a Single Agent (REGARD) Patients received either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every two weeks. Patients randomized to CYRAMZA received a median of 4 doses; the median duration of exposure was 8 weeks and 32 (14% of 236) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months. The most common serious adverse reactions with CYRAMZA were anemia (3.8%) and intestinal obstruction (2.1%). Red blood cell transfusions were given to 11% of CYRAMZA-treated patients versus 8.7% of patients who received placebo. The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA-treated patients at a rate of ≥10% and ≥2% higher than placebo were hypertension and diarrhea. Table 2 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions (CTCAE, version 4.0) in REGARD.

In REGARD, according to laboratory assessment, 8% of CYRAMZA-treated patients developed proteinuria versus 3% of placebo-treated patients. Two patients discontinued CYRAMZA due to proteinuria. The rate of gastrointestinal perforation in REGARD was 0.8% and the rate of IRR was 0.4%. CYRAMZA Administered in Combination with Paclitaxel (RAINBOW) Patients received paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle with either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every two weeks. Patients randomized to CYRAMZA received a median of 9 doses; the median duration of exposure was 18 weeks, and 93 (28% of 327) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months. The most common serious adverse reactions in patients who received CYRAMZA with paclitaxel were neutropenia (3.7%) and febrile neutropenia (2.4%); 19% of patients who received CYRAMZA with paclitaxel received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of any component of the CYRAMZA with paclitaxel combination in ≥2% of patients in RAINBOW were neutropenia (4%) and thrombocytopenia (3%). The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in patients who received CYRAMZA with paclitaxel at a rate of ≥30% and ≥2% higher than placebo with paclitaxel were fatigue/asthenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and epistaxis.

Patients had previously untreated EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation-positive metastatic NSCLC. Patients had ECOG PS 0 or 1. RELAY excluded patients with bilirubin greater than the ULN, central nervous system (CNS) metastases, clinically active interstitial lung disease (ILD), uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, radiographic evidence of major blood vessel invasion or encasement by cancer or intra-tumor cavitation, or gross hemoptysis within the preceding 2 months. The study also excluded patients receiving chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) or anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin. 14.2 )] Patients received either CYRAMZA 10 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every two weeks in combination with erlotinib 150 mg taken orally once daily. Patients randomized to CYRAMZA received a median of 21 doses; the median duration of exposure was 11 months, and 90 (41% of 221) patients received CYRAMZA for at least 12 months. The most common serious adverse reactions in patients who received CYRAMZA with erlotinib were pneumonia (3.2%), cellulitis (1.8%), and pneumothorax (1.8%). Red blood cell transfusions were given to 3.2% of CYRAMZA-treated patients versus 0 patients who received placebo. Treatment discontinuation of all study drugs due to adverse reactions occurred in 13% of CYRAMZA with erlotinib-treated patients, with increased alanine aminotransferase (1.4%) and paronychia (1.4%) being the most common. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of CYRAMZA were proteinuria (8.6%) and hyperbilirubinemia (6%). The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA with erlotinib-treated patients at a rate of ≥30% of patients and ≥2% higher than placebo with erlotinib-treated patients were infections, hypertension, stomatitis, proteinuria, alopecia, and epistaxis.

REVEL excluded patients with bilirubin greater than the ULN, uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, radiographic evidence of major airway or blood vessel invasion by cancer, radiographic evidence of intra-tumor cavitation, or gross hemoptysis within the preceding 2 months, and patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or chronic anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin. 14.2 )]. Patients received either CYRAMZA 10 mg/kg or placebo intravenously in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 intravenously every 21 days. Due to an increased incidence of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in patients enrolled in East Asian sites, REVEL was amended and 24 patients (11 patients receiving CYRAMZA with docetaxel, 13 patients receiving placebo with docetaxel) at East Asian sites received a starting dose of docetaxel at 60 mg/m 2 every three weeks. Patients randomized to CYRAMZA received a median of 4.5 doses; the median duration of exposure was 3.5 months, and 195 (31% of 627) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months. The most common serious adverse reactions in patients who received CYRAMZA with docetaxel were febrile neutropenia (14%), pneumonia (6%), and neutropenia (5%). The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors was 42% in CYRAMZA with docetaxel-treated patients versus 37% in patients who received placebo with docetaxel. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of CYRAMZA were IRR (0.5%) and epistaxis (0.3%). For patients with non-squamous histology, the overall incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was 7% and the incidence of Grade ≥3 pulmonary hemorrhage was 1% for CYRAMZA with docetaxel compared to 6% overall incidence and 1% for Grade ≥3 pulmonary hemorrhage for placebo with docetaxel. For patients with squamous histology, the overall incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage was 10% and the incidence of Grade ≥3 pulmonary hemorrhage was 2% for CYRAMZA with docetaxel compared to 12% overall incidence and 2% for Grade ≥3 pulmonary hemorrhage for placebo with docetaxel. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently in CYRAMZA with docetaxel-treated patients (9%) than in placebo with docetaxel-treated patients (5%). The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA with docetaxel-treated patients at a rate of ≥30% and ≥2% higher than placebo with docetaxel were neutropenia, fatigue/asthenia, and stomatitis/mucosal inflammation. Table 6 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions (NCI CTCAE, version 4.0) in REVEL.

Patients had mCRC with disease progression on or after therapy with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine and ECOG PS 0 or 1. RAISE excluded patients with uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, and those who experienced any of the following during first-line therapy with a bevacizumab-containing regimen: an arterial thrombotic/thromboembolic event; Grade 4 hypertension; Grade 3 proteinuria; a Grade 3-4 bleeding event; or bowel perforation. 14.3 )] Patients received either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously in combination with FOLFIRI intravenously every two weeks. Patients randomized to CYRAMZA received a median of 8 doses (range 1-68); the median duration of exposure was 4.4 months, and 169 (32% of 529) patients received CYRAMZA for at least six months. The most common serious adverse reactions with CYRAMZA with FOLFIRI were diarrhea (3.6%), intestinal obstruction (3.0%), and febrile neutropenia (2.8%). Treatment discontinuation of any study drug due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently in CYRAMZA with FOLFIRI-treated patients (29%) than in placebo with FOLFIRI-treated patients (13%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of any component of CYRAMZA with FOLFIRI as compared to placebo with FOLFIRI were neutropenia (12.5% versus 5.3%) and thrombocytopenia (4.2% versus 0.8%). The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of CYRAMZA were proteinuria (1.5%) and gastrointestinal perforation (1.7%). The most common adverse reactions (all grades) observed in CYRAMZA with FOLFIRI-treated patients at a rate of ≥30% and ≥2% higher than placebo with FOLFIRI were diarrhea, neutropenia, decreased appetite, epistaxis, and stomatitis. Twenty percent of patients treated with CYRAMZA with FOLFIRI received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Table 7 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions (CTCAE, version 4.0) in RAISE.

Patients underwent periodic TSH laboratory assessments until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Increased TSH levels were observed in 53 (46%) patients treated with CYRAMZA with FOLFIRI compared with 4 (4%) patients treated with placebo with FOLFIRI. Hepatocellular Carcinoma The safety of CYRAMZA was evaluated in REACH-2 [see Clinical Studies ( . Patients had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B HCC who were no longer amenable to locoregional therapy, or BCLC stage C HCC, Child-Pugh score A, and baseline AFP ≥400 ng/mL. Patients had ECOG PS 0 or 1. REACH-2 excluded patients with clinically meaningful ascites, history of or current hepatic encephalopathy, uncontrolled hypertension, major surgery within 28 days, bilirubin >1.5 times ULN, severe variceal bleeding in the 3 months prior to treatment or with varices at high risk of bleeding, and patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation or chronic anti-platelet therapy other than once daily aspirin. 14.4 )] Patients received either CYRAMZA 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously every two weeks. Patients received a median of 6 doses (range 1-51) of CYRAMZA; the median duration of exposure was 12 weeks (range 2-107 weeks) and 48 patients (24% of 197) received CYRAMZA for at least six months. The most common serious adverse reactions with CYRAMZA were ascites (3%) and pneumonia (3%). Treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 18% of CYRAMZA-treated patients, with proteinuria being the most frequent (2%). The most common adverse reactions reported in ≥15% of patients and ≥2% higher than placebo were fatigue, peripheral edema, hypertension, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, proteinuria, nausea, and ascites. The most common laboratory abnormalities ≥30% and ≥2% higher than placebo were thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia. Table 8 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions (CTCAE, version 4.0) and Table 9 provides the incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities in REACH-2.

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to CYRAMZA with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In clinical trials, 86/2890 (3%) of CYRAMZA-treated patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 14 of the 86 patients who tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-ramucirumab antibodies. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CYRAMZA. Because such reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system: Thrombotic microangiopathy Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified: Hemangioma Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal: Dysphonia Vascular: Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture Cardiac: Heart failure"
