    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other components of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. Hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions, have been reported in patients treated with methylphenidate [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with an MAOI, because of the risk of hypertensive crises [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Known hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other product components of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets (4) . Concurrent treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), or use of an MAOI within the preceding 14 days (4) .",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease : Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease (5.2). Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate : Monitor blood pressure and pulse (5.3). Psychiatric Adverse Reactions : Prior to initiating methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. If new psychotic or manic symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets (5.4). Priapism : If abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections occur, patients should seek immediate medical attention (5.5). Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud’s Phenomenon : Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy (5.6). Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients : Closely monitor growth (height and weight) in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted (5.7). Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma: Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets -treated patients considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., patients with significant hyperopia) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist (5.8). Increased Intraocular Pressure (IOP) and Glaucoma: Prescribe methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets to patients with open-angle glaucoma or abnormally increased IOP only if the benefit of treatment is considered to outweigh the risk. Closely monitor patients with a history of increased IOP or open angle glaucoma (5.9). Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette’s Syndrome: Before initiating methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Regularly monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate (5.10). 5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets can be diverted for nonmedical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)] , and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. Before prescribing methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets to anyone else. Throughout methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment, reassess each patient’s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. 5.2 Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who are treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets use in patients with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. 5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 beats per minute). Some patients may have larger increases. Monitor all methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients for hypertension and tachycardia. 5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed mood episode in patients. Prior to initiating methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression). New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple shortterm, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. 5.5 Priapism Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate use in both adult and pediatric male patients. Although priapism was not reported with methylphenidate initiation, it developed after some time on methylphenidate, often subsequent to an increase in dosage. Priapism also occurred during methylphenidate withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention. 5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud’s Phenomenon CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud’s phenomenon, were observed in postmarketing reports and at the therapeutic dosage of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or discontinuation of the CNS stimulant. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. 5.7 Long-Term Suppression of Growth CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that pediatric patients who received methylphenidate for 7 days per week throughout the year had a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this development period. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated pediatric patients. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. 5.8 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma There have been reports of angle closure glaucoma associated with methylphenidate treatment. Although the mechanism is not clear, methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., patients with significant hyperopia) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. 5.9 Increased Intraocular Pressure and Glaucoma There have been reports of an elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with methylphenidate treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Prescribe methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and methylphenidate hydrochloride sustained-release tablets to patients with open-angle glaucoma or abnormally increased IOP only if the benefit of treatment is considered to outweigh the risk. Closely monitor methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients with a history of abnormally increased IOP or open angle glaucoma. 5.10 Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette’s Syndrome CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette’s syndrome has also been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. Before initiating methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette’s syndrome. Regularly monitor methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette’s syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.",
