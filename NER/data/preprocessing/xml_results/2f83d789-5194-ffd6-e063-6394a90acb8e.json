  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE RALDESY TM is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in adults. RALDESY is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in adults ( 1 ) .",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS RALDESY is contraindicated in patients taking, or within 14 days of stopping, monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) , including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue, because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) , or use within 14 days of stopping MAOIs ( 4 ) .",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents ( e.g. , SSRI, SNRI, triptans ) , but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue RALDESY and initiate supportive treatment ( 5.2 ) . Cardiac Arrhythmias: Increases the QT interval. Avoid use with drugs that also increase the QT interval and in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval ( 5.3 ) . Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope: Warn patients of risk and symptoms of hypotension ( 5.4 ) . Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.5 ) . Priapism: Cases of painful and prolonged penile erections and priapism have been reported. Immediate medical attention should be sought if signs and symptoms of prolonged penile erections or priapism are observed ( 5.6 ) . Activation of Mania or Hypomania: Screen for bipolar disorder and monitor for mania or hypomania ( 5.7 ) . Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Has potential to impair judgment, thinking, and motor skills. Advise patients to use caution when operating machinery ( 5.9 ) . Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Avoid use of antidepressants, including RALDESY, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. ( 5.10 ) . 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs ( SSRIs and other antidepressant classes ) that included approximately 77.000 adult patients and over 4.500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1.000 patients treated are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Risk Differences of the Number of Cases of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range ( years ) Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1.000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional patients 18-24 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer patient ≥65 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients extends to longer-term use, i.e. , beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing RALDESY, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome SSRIs, including RALDESY, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs ( including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John’s Wort ) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. , MAOIs [see Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes ( e.g. , agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma ) , autonomic instability ( e.g. , tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular symptoms ( e.g. , tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination ) , seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms ( e.g. , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ) . The concomitant use of RALDESY with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate RALDESY in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes ( such as oral tablets or local tissue injection ) . If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking RALDESY, discontinue RALDESY before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Monitor all patients taking RALDESY for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with RALDESY and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of RALDESY with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Cardiac Arrhythmias Clinical studies indicate that trazodone hydrochloride may be arrhythmogenic in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs, ventricular couplets, tachycardia with syncope, and torsade de pointes. Postmarketing reports, including torsade de pointes have been reported at doses of 100 mg or less with the immediate-release trazodone hydrochloride tablets. RALDESY should also be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, as well as other circumstances that may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death, including symptomatic bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and the presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. RALDESY is not recommended for use during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction. Caution should be used when administering RALDESY to patients with cardiac disease and such patients should be closely monitored, since antidepressant drugs ( including RALDESY ) may cause cardiac arrhythmias [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] Trazodone hydrochloride prolongs the QT/QT c interval. The use of RALDESY Should be avoided in patients with known QT prolongation or in combination with other drugs that are inhibitors of CYP3 A4 ( e.g. , itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole ) , or known to prolong QT interval including Class 1 A antiarrhythmics ( e.g. , quinidine, procainamide ) or Class 3 antiarrhythmics ( e.g. , amiodarone, sotalol ) , certain antipsychotic medications ( e.g. , ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine ) , and certain antibiotics ( e.g. , gatifloxacin ) . Concomitant administration of drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . 5.4 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope has been reported in patients receiving trazodone hydrochloride. Concomitant use with an antihypertensive may require a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug. 5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including RALDESY, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ) , other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies ( case-control and cohort design ) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of RALDESY and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing RALDESY. 5.6 Priapism Cases of priapism ( painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration ) have been reported in males receiving trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Males who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should immediately discontinue the drug and seek emergency medical attention [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) , Overdosage ( 10 ) ] . RALDESY should be used with caution in males who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism ( e.g. , sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia ) , or in men with anatomical deformation of the penis ( e.g. , angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie’s disease ) . 5.7 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with RALDESY or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Activation of mania/hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with antidepressants. Prior to initiating treatment with RALDESY, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] 5.8 Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances ( e.g. , paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations ) , tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [See Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] . 5.9 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment RALDESY TM may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them adversely. 5.10 Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including RALDESY may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including RALDESY, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. 5.11 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including RALDESY. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) . In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue RALDESY and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]",

Occasional sinus bradycardia has occurred in long-term studies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trazodone hydrochloride tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: hemolytic anemia, leukocytosis Cardiac disorders: cardiospasm, congestive heart failure, conduction block, orthostatic hypotension and syncope, palpitations, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, ventricular ectopic activity, including ventricular tachycardia and QT prolongation. Prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia have been reported at doses of 100 mg per day or less [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] .
