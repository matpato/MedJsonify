The following reactions have been reported in association with the administration of deferiprone: Henoch-Schönlein purpura; urticaria; and periorbital edema with skin rash [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )].

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Liver Enzyme Elevations: Monitor monthly and discontinue for persistent elevations. ( 5.2 ) Zinc Deficiency: Monitor during therapy and supplement for deficiency. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Agranulocytosis and Neutropenia Fatal agranulocytosis can occur with FERRIPROX use. FERRIPROX can also cause neutropenia, which may foreshadow agranulocytosis. Measure the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) before starting FERRIPROX therapy and monitor it regularly while on therapy. Reduction in the frequency of ANC monitoring should be considered on an individual patient basis, according to the health care provider's assessment of the patient's understanding of the risk minimization measures required during therapy. Interrupt FERRIPROX therapy if neutropenia develops (ANC < 1.5 x 10 9 /L). Interrupt FERRIPROX if infection develops and monitor the ANC frequently. Advise patients taking FERRIPROX to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative of infection. The incidence of agranulocytosis was 1% of patients in pooled clinical trials of 642 patients with thalassemia syndromes and 0.5% of patients in pooled clinical trials of 196 patients with sickle cell disease or other anemias. The mechanism of FERRIPROX-associated agranulocytosis is unknown. Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon discontinuation of FERRIPROX, but there have been reports of agranulocytosis leading to death. Implement a plan to monitor for and to manage agranulocytosis and neutropenia prior to initiating FERRIPROX treatment. For agranulocytosis (ANC < 0.2 x 10 9 /L) and severe neutropenia (0.2 x 109/L ≤ ANC < 0.5 x 109/L): Consider hospitalization and other management as clinically appropriate. Do not resume FERRIPROX in patients who have developed agranulocytosis unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks. Do not rechallenge patients who have developed neutropenia with FERRIPROX unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks. For neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 x 10 9 /L and ≥ 0.5 x 10 9 /L): Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue FERRIPROX and all other medications with a potential to cause neutropenia. Obtain a complete blood cell (CBC) count, including a white blood cell (WBC) count corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and a platelet count daily until recovery (ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10 9 /L). 5.2 Liver Enzyme Elevations In pooled clinical trials, 7.5% of 642 patients with thalassemia syndromes treated with FERRIPROX developed increased ALT values. Four (0.62%) FERRIPROX-treated subjects discontinued the drug due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 (0.16%) due to an increase in both ALT and AST. In pooled clinical trials, 7.7% of 196 patients with sickle cell disease or other anemias treated with FERRIPROX developed increased ALT values. Monitor serum ALT values monthly during therapy with FERRIPROX and consider interruption of therapy if there is a persistent increase in the serum transaminase levels [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 )] 5.3 Zinc Deficiency Decreased plasma zinc concentrations have been observed on FERRIPROX therapy. Monitor plasma zinc annually, and supplement in the event of a deficiency [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 )] 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and evidence of genotoxicity, FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. The available data on the use of FERRIPROX in pregnant women are insufficient to inform risk. In animal studies, administration of deferiprone during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal death and malformations at doses lower than equivalent human clinical doses. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least six months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least three months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )].",

The following adverse reaction information represents the pooled data collected from single arm or active-controlled clinical trials with FERRIPROX Tablets (deferiprone) (three times a day) or FERRIPROX Oral Solution (deferiprone). Thalassemia Syndromes The safety of FERRIPROX was evaluated in the pooled clinical trial database [see Clinical Studies ( . Patients received FERRIPROX Tablets (three times a day) or FERRIPROX Oral Solution. FERRIPROX was administered orally three times a day (total daily dose either 50, 75, or 99 mg/kg), N=642.

The most serious adverse reaction reported in clinical trials with FERRIPROX was agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )] The most common adverse reactions (≥6%) reported during clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgia, alanine aminotransferase increased and neutropenia. The table below lists the adverse drug reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients treated with FERRIPROX in clinical trials in patients with thalassemia syndromes.

Chromaturia (reddish/brown discoloration of the urine) is a result of the excretion of iron in the urine. Sickle Cell Disease or Other Anemias The safety of FERRIPROX compared to deferoxamine was evaluated in LA38-0411 [see Clinical Studies ( . Patients received FERRIPROX Tablets or FERRIPROX Oral Solution orally three times a day (total daily dose 75-99 mg/kg/day) n=152) or the control arm, deferoxamine, 20-40 mg/kg/day (children) or 40-50 mg/kg/day (adults), by subcutaneous infusion for 5 – 7 days per week, n=76. Among 152 patients receiving FERRIPROX, 120 (78.9%) were exposed for 6 months or longer and 17 (11.2%) were exposed for greater than one year. 14.2 )] The median age of patients who received FERRIPROX was 15 years (range 3, 59 years); 54.6% male; 78.9% White, 15.1% Black and 5.9% Multi-racial. The most common adverse reactions (≥6%) reported during clinical trials in patients with SCD or other anemias were pyrexia, abdominal pain, bone pain, headache, vomiting, pain in extremity, sickle cell anemia with crisis, back pain, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, arthralgia, oropharyngeal pain, nasopharyngitis, neutrophil count decreased, cough and nausea.

Pediatric Patients FERRIPROX has been studied in 86 pediatric patients with sickle cell disease or other anemias. Pediatric patients (<17 years) had an increase in the following adverse reactions as compared to adults: abdominal pain, neutrophil count decreased, bone pain and oropharyngeal pain. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving FERRIPROX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: thrombocytosis, pancytopenia. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, cardiac failure. Congenital, familial and genetic disorders: hypospadias. Eye disorders: diplopia, papilledema, retinal toxicity. Gastrointestinal disorders: enterocolitis, rectal hemorrhage, gastric ulcer, pancreatitis, parotid gland enlargement.
