    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) : MDS/AML occurred in patients exposed to TALZENNA, and some cases were fatal. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity and discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. ( 5.1 ) • Myelosuppression : TALZENNA may affect hematopoiesis and can cause anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia. ( 5.2 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : TALZENNA can cause fetal harm. Advise of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\tMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) , including cases with a fatal outcome, has been reported in patients who received TALZENNA. Overall, MDS/AML has been reported in 0.4 % (3 out of 788 ) of solid tumor patients treated with TALZENNA as a single agent in clinical studies. In TALAPRO-2, MDS/AML occurred in 2 out of 511 (0.4%) patients treated with TALZENNA and enzalutamide and in 0 out of 517 (0%) patients treated with placebo and enzalutamide The durations of TALZENNA treatment in these five patients prior to developing MDS/AML [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] were 0.3, 1, 2, 3, and 5 years , respectively. Most of these patients had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA damaging agents including radiotherapy. Do not start TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy. Monitor blood counts monthly during treatment with TALZENNA . For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt TALZENNA and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. If counts do not recover within 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. If MDS/AML is confirmed, discontinue TALZENNA. 5.2\tMyelosuppression Myelosuppression consisting of anemia, neutropenia , and/or thrombocytopenia, have been reported in patients treated with TALZENNA [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 39%, 21%, and 15% of patients receiving TALZENNA as a single agent . Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 0.7%, 0.3%, and 0.3% of patients. In TALAPRO-2, Grade ≥3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported, respectively, in 45%, 18%, and 8% of patients receiving TALZENNA and enzalutamide. Overall, 39% of patients (199/511) required a red blood cell transfusion, including 22% (111/511) who required multiple transfusions. Discontinuation due to anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred, respectively, in 7%, 3%, and 0.4% of patients. Withhold TALZENNA until patients have adequately recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous therapy. Monitor blood counts monthly during treatment with TALZENNA. If hematological toxicities do not resolve within 28 days, discontinue TALZENNA and refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics . [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] 5.3\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal data, TALZENNA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In an animal reproduction study, administration of talazoparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused fetal malformations and structural skeletal variations, and embryo-fetal death at exposures that were 0.24 times the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 1 mg daily. Apprise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of TALZENNA [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months following the last dose of TALZENNA [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]",

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to single agent TALZENNA in solid tumor clinical studies, including 286 patients enrolled in EMBRACA trial and to TALZENNA 0.5 mg daily in combination with enzalutamide in 511 patients enrolled in the TALAPRO-2 trial that included 197 patients with HRR gene-mutated mCRPC. g BRCA m HER2-negative Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer EMBRACA The safety of TALZENNA as a single agent was evaluated in g BRCA m patients with HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had previously received no more than 3 lines of chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic disease [see . EMBRACA was a randomized, open-label, multi-center study in which 412 patients received either TALZENNA 1 mg once daily (N=286) or a chemotherapy agent (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine) of the healthcare provider's choice (N=126) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Permanent discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 5% of TALZENNA patients. Dosing interruptions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 65% of patients receiving TALZENNA; dose reductions due to any cause occurred in 53% of TALZENNA patients.

TALZENNA with Enzalutamide N=197 Placebo with Enzalutamide N=199 Grades 1-4 % Grade 3 % Grade 4 % Grades 1-4 % Grade 3 % Grade 4 % Fatigue Includes fatigue and asthenia. 49 4 0 40 1 0 Nausea 21 2 0 17 1 0.5 Decreased appetite 20 1 0 14 1 1 Fractures Fractures include multiple similar terms. 14 3 0 10 1.5 0 Dizziness Includes dizziness, dizziness postural, vertigo. 13 1.5 0 9 1.5 0 Dysgeusia Includes ageusia, anosmia, dysgeusia. 10 0 0 4.5 0 0 Clinically relevant adverse reactions in <10% of patients who received TALZENNA with enzalutamide included abdominal pain (9%), vomiting (9%), alopecia (7%), dyspepsia (4%), venous thromboembolism (3%) and stomatitis (2%).
