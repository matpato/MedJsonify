  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide is a combination of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic indicated for: Treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.1 ) Reduction of the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. There is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Hypertension Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular ( CV ) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ( JNC ) . Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension ( for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia ) , and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects ( as monotherapy ) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects ( e.g. , on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease ) . These considerations may guide selection of therapy. This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) ] . Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, but there is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients. [See Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) , and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] .",

  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. ( 5.2 ) Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients. ( 5.3 ) Observe for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance. ( 5.5 ) Acute angle-closure glaucoma. ( 5.6 ) Exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. Adverse reactions include fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients ( e.g. , those being treated with high doses of diuretics ) , symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. Do not use losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide as initial therapy in patients with intravascular volume depletion. 5.3 Impaired Renal Function Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-­angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system ( e.g. , patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion ) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 ) ] . 5.4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma but are more likely in patients with such a history [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Effects In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia ( serum potassium <3.5 mEq/L ) was 6.7% versus 3.5% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia ( serum potassium >5.7 mEq/L ) was 0.4% versus 0% for placebo. Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide also contains losartan which can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Concomitant use of other drugs that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in patients receiving thiazide therapy. Because losartan decreases uric acid, losartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide attenuates the diuretic-induced hyperuricemia. Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels. 5.6 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. 5.7 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo ) are dizziness, upper respiratory infection, cough, and back pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in 858 patients treated for essential hypertension and 3889 patients treated for hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse events was required in only 2.8% and 2.3% of patients treated with the combination and placebo, respectively. In these double-blind controlled clinical trials, adverse reactions occurring in greater than 2% of subjects treated with losartan-hydrochlorothiazide and at a greater rate than placebo were: back pain ( 2.1% vs 0.6% ) , dizziness ( 5.7% vs 2.9% ) , and upper respiratory infection ( 6.1% vs 4.6% ) . The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide and/or the individual components: Blood and the lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Anorexia, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, electrolyte imbalance including hyponatremia and hypokalemia. Psychiatric disorders: Insomnia, restlessness. Nervous system disorders: Dysgeusia, headache, migraine, paraesthesias. Xanthopsia, transient blurred vision. Eye disorders: Cardiac disorders: Palpitation, tachycardia. Vascular disorders: Dose-related orthostatic effects, necrotizing angiitis ( vasculitis, cutaneous vasculitis ) . Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal disorders: Dyspepsia, abdominal pain, gastric irritation, cramping, nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, sialoadenitis. Hepato-biliary disorders: Jaundice ( intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice ) . Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash, pruritus, purpura, toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, photosensitivity, cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Muscle cramps, muscle spasm. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Glycosuria, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis, renal failure. Renal and urinary disorders: Reproductive system and breast disorders: Erectile dysfunction/impotence. General disorders and administration site conditions: Chest pain, malaise, weakness. Liver function abnormalities. Investigations: Cough Persistent dry cough has been associated with ACE-inhibitor use and in practice can be a cause of discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Two prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who had experienced cough while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. Patients who had typical ACE-inhibitor cough when challenged with lisinopril, whose cough disappeared on placebo, were randomized to losartan 50 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, or either placebo ( one study, n=97 ) or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide ( n=135 ) . The double-blind treatment period lasted up to 8 weeks. The incidence of cough is shown in Table 1 below. Table 1: * Demographics = ( 89% Caucasian, 64% female ) † Demographics = ( 90% Caucasian, 51% female ) Study 1* HCTZ Losartan Lisinopril Cough 25% 17% 69% Study 2 † Placebo Losartan Lisinopril Cough 35% 29% 62% These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy, in a population that all had cough associated with ACE-inhibitor therapy, is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy. Cases of cough, including positive re-challenges, have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Digestive: Hepatitis has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan. Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity: Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue. Vasculitis, including Henoch-Schönlein purpura; anaphylactic reactions which can present as respiratory distress ( including pneumonitis and pulmonary edema ) . Rhabdomyolysis. Musculoskeletal: Skin: Erythroderma. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16.000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of ≥50.000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6.700 patients per year."
