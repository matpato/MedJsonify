Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of ≥5% in an uncontrolled trial in 66 patients with cystinuria age 9 to 68 years are shown in the table below. Patients in group 1 had previously been treated with d-penicillamine; those in group 2 had not. Of those patients who had stopped taking d-penicillamine due to toxicity (34 out of 49 patients in group 1), 22 were able to continue treatment with tiopronin. In those without prior history of d-penicillamine treatment, 6% developed reactions of sufficient severity to require tiopronin withdrawal. Table 1 presents adverse reactions ≥5% in either treatment group occurring in this trial. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in One or More Patients System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Group 1 Previously treated with d-penicillamine (N=49) Group 2 Naïve to d-penicillamine (N=17) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders anemia 1 (2%) 1 (6%) Gastrointestinal Disorders nausea 12 (25%) 2 (12%) emesis 5 (10%) – diarrhea/soft stools 9 (18%) 1 (6%) abdominal pain – 1 (6%) oral ulcers 6 (12%) 3 (18%) General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions fever 4 (8%) – weakness 2 (4%) 2 (12%) fatigue 7 (14%) – peripheral (edema) 3 (6%) 1 (6%) chest pain – 1 (6%) Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders anorexia 4 (8%) – Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders arthralgia – 2 (12%) Renal and Urinary Disorders proteinuria 5 (10%) 1 (6%) impotence – 1 (6%) Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders cough – 1 (6%) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders rash 7 (14%) 2 (12%) ecchymosis 3 (6%) – pruritus 2 (4%) 1 (6%) urticaria 4 (8%) – skin wrinkling 3 (6%) 1 (6%) Taste Disturbance A reduction in taste perception may develop. It is believed to be the result of chelation of trace metals by tiopronin. Hypogeusia is often self-limited. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Adverse reactions have been reported from the literature, as well as during postapproval use of tiopronin. Because the postapproval reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to tiopronin exposure. Adverse reactions reported during the postmarketing use of tiopronin are listed by body system in Table 2 .
