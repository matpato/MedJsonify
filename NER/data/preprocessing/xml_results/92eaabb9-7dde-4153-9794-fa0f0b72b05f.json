  "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Leuprolide acetate injection is indicated in the palliative treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.",
  "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Leuprolide acetate injection is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to GnRH, GnRH agonist analogs or any of the excipients in leuprolide acetate injection: Reports of anaphylactic reactions to GnRH agonist analogs have been reported in the medical literature.",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Initially, leuprolide acetate, like other LH-RH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone. Transient worsening of symptoms, or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer, may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of leuprolide acetate treatment. A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. As with other LH-RH agonists, isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically. Leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm. Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) levels is recommended, especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology. It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions.PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy ( see and WARNINGS sections ) . ADVERSE REACTIONS Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol, an ingredient of the drug's vehicle, may present symptoms of hypersensitivity, usually local, in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site. Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists. Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Monitor blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1 c ) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes. Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. Based on findings in animal studies, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy ( sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis ) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. Information for Patients See which appears after the INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS section. REFERENCE Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) . In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued. Drug Interactions See section. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary-gonadal system. Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted with leuprolide acetate in rats and mice. In rats, a dose-related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses ( 0.6 to 4 mg/kg ) . There was a significant but not dose-related increase of pancreatic islet-cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males ( highest incidence in the low dose group ) . In mice, no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg/kg for two years. Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg/day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg/day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities. Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems. These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential. Leuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male and female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3 months ( approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans ) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and suppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of a monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy ( sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis ) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose ( see ) . Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus. Data Data Animal Data Major fetal malformations were observed in developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rabbits after a single administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0.00024, 0.0024, and 0.024 mg/kg ( approximately 1/600 to 1/6 the human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose in animals and humans ) . Since a depot formulation was utilized in the study, a sustained exposure to leuprolide was expected throughout the period of organogenesis and to the end of gestation. Similar studies in rats did not demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations, however, there was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats. Lactation The safety and efficacy of leuprolide acetate have not been established in females. There is no information regarding the presence of leuprolide acetate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from leuprolide acetate, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action, leuprolide acetate may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential. Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for leuprolide acetate injection, the majority ( 69% ) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age. Therefore, the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in this population.",
  "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment. This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms, usually manifested by an increase in bone pain ( see section ) . In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week. Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases. WARNINGS Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and/or urinary obstruction which, if aggravated, may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction. In a comparative trial of leuprolide acetate injection versus DES, in 5% or more of the patients receiving either drug, the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician. Often, causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Reactions considered not drug related are excluded. * Physiologic effect of decreased testosterone.

Postmarketing During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations, the following adverse events were reported. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely ( incidence rate of about 0.002% ) reported. Rash, urticaria, and photosensitivity reactions have also been reported. Localized reactions including induration and abscess have been reported at the site of injection. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia ( e.g. , joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath ) have been reported individually and collectively. Cardiovascular System – Hypotension, Myocardial infarction, Pulmonary embolism; Endocrine System – Diabetes; Gastrointestinal System – Hepatic dysfunction; Hepato-biliary disorder – Serious drug-induced liver injury; Hemic and Lymphatic System – Decreased WBC; Integumentary System – Hair growth; Central/Peripheral Nervous System – Convulsion, Peripheral neuropathy, Spinal fracture/paralysis, Hearing disorder; Miscellaneous – Hard nodule in throat, Weight gain, Increased uric acid; Musculoskeletal System – Tenosynovitis-like symptoms; Respiratory System – Respiratory disorders, Interstitial lung disease; Urogenital System – Prostate pain. Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH-RH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Pituitary apoplexy: During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy ( a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland ) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed, with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. See other LUPRON DEPOT and leuprolide acetate injection package inserts for other events reported in the same and different patient populations.
