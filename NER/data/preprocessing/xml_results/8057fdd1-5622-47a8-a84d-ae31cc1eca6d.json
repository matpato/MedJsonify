  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Infections : Serious, life-threatening infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST. Do not initiate treatment with ARCALYST in patients with active or chronic infections. Discontinue treatment if a patient develops a serious infection. ( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of ARCALYST and initiate appropriate therapy. ( 5.3 ) Immunizations : Avoid live vaccines. Update recommended vaccinations prior to initiation of therapy per current guidelines. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) blockade may interfere with the immune response to infections. Treatment with another medication that works through inhibition of IL-1 has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections, and serious infections have been reported in patients taking ARCALYST [see . There was a greater incidence of infections in CAPS and RP patients on ARCALYST compared with placebo. Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] In the controlled portion of the CAPS study [see , severe infection ( bronchitis ) was reported in one patient receiving ARCALYST. In an open-label extension study in CAPS, one patient developed bacterial meningitis and died Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] In clinical studies, ARCALYST has not been administered concomitantly with tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitors. An increased incidence of serious infections has been associated with administration of an IL-1 blocker in combination with TNF inhibitors. ARCALYST is not recommended for use with TNF inhibitors because this may increase the risk of serious infections. Drugs that affect the immune system by blocking TNF have been associated with an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis ( TB ) . It is possible that taking drugs such as ARCALYST that block IL-1 increases the risk of TB or other atypical or opportunistic infections. Refer to current practice guidelines for evaluation and treatment of possible latent tuberculosis infections before initiating therapy with ARCALYST. Treatment with ARCALYST should not be initiated in patients with an active or chronic infection. Discontinue ARCALYST if a patient develops a serious infection. 5.2 Risk of Malignancy The impact of treatment with ARCALYST on the development of malignancies is not known. Treatment with immunosuppressants, including ARCALYST, may result in an increase in the risk of malignancies. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions associated with ARCALYST occurred in clinical trials. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue ARCALYST and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.4 Lipid Profile Changes Cholesterol and lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Increases in non-fasting lipid profile parameters occurred in patients treated with ARCALYST in clinical trials. Monitor patients' lipid profiles and consider lipid-lowering therapies if needed, based on cardiovascular risk factors and current guidelines [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . 5.5 Immunizations Since no data are available on the risks of secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST, avoid administration of live vaccines during treatment with ARCALYST. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccines in patients receiving ARCALYST. Since ARCALYST may interfere with normal immune response to new antigens, vaccines may not be effective in patients receiving ARCALYST. Because IL-1 blockade may interfere with immune response to infections, it is recommended that prior to initiation of therapy with ARCALYST, adult and pediatric patients receive all recommended vaccinations, as per current immunization guidelines, including pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine.",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling. Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Risk of Malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Lipid Profile Changes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] The most common adverse reactions reported by patients with CAPS and RP treated with ARCALYST are injection-site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections.

The data described herein reflect exposure to ARCALYST in over 2.000 patients who received at least one dose, including approximately 1700 exposed to 160 mg or more, of whom 151 patients were exposed for at least 6 months and 111 patients for at least one year. These included patients with CAPS and RP, patients with other diseases, and healthy volunteers. CAPS Approximately 60 patients with CAPS were treated weekly with 160 mg of ARCALYST. The pivotal trial population included 47 patients with CAPS. These patients were between the ages of 22 and 78 years ( average 51 years ) . Thirty-one patients were female and 16 were male. All of the patients were White/Caucasian. Six pediatric patients ( 12 to17 years ) were enrolled directly into the open-label extension phase of the trial. Part A of the clinical trial was conducted in patients with CAPS who were naïve to treatment with ARCALYST. Part A of the study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, six-week study comparing ARCALYST to placebo [see . Table 1 reflects the frequency of adverse events reported by at least two patients during Part A. Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] Table 1: Most Frequent Adverse Reactions in Patients with CAPS ( Part A, Reported by at Least Two Patients ) Adverse Event ARCALYST 160 mg ( n = 23 ) Placebo ( n= 24 ) Any AE 17 ( 74% ) 13 ( 54% ) Injection-site reactions 11 ( 48% ) 3 ( 13% ) Upper respiratory tract infection 6 ( 26% ) 1 ( 4% ) Nausea 1 ( 4% ) 3 ( 13% ) Diarrhea 1 ( 4% ) 3 ( 13% ) Sinusitis 2 ( 9% ) 1 ( 4% ) Abdominal pain upper 0 2 ( 8% ) Cough 2 ( 9% ) 0 Hypoesthesia 2 ( 9% ) 0 Stomach discomfort 1 ( 4% ) 1 ( 4% ) Urinary tract infection 1 ( 4% ) 1 ( 4% ) DIRA In a 2-year, open-label study, 6 pediatric patients with DIRA, 3 years to 6 years of age, received a 2.2 to 4.4 mg/kg dose of ARCALYST once weekly [see . The safety profile was generally consistent with that seen in patients with CAPS. The most common adverse reactions were upper respiratory infection ( 6 of 6 ) , rash ( 5 of 6 ) , otitis media ( 3 of 6 ) , pharyngitis ( 3 of 6 ) and rhinorrhea ( 3 of 6 ) . Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] RP In the RP phase 3 study, a total of 86 patients received at least one dose of ARCALYST with a median treatment duration of 9 months [see Of the patients, 49 ( 57% ) were female and 37 ( 43% ) were male; 93% were White/Caucasian. The mean age was 44.7 years. Seven patients ( 8% ) were aged 12-17 years old. No new adverse reactions were identified in this study. Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ] . Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Injection-Site Reactions In patients with CAPS or RP, the most common and consistently reported adverse event associated with ARCALYST was injection-site reaction ( ISR ) . The ISRs included erythema, swelling, pruritus, mass, bruising, inflammation, pain, edema, dermatitis, discomfort, urticaria, vesicles, warmth and hemorrhage. Most injection-site reactions lasted for one to two days. Infections During Part A in the CAPS study, the incidence of patients reporting infections was greater with ARCALYST ( 48% ) than with placebo ( 17% ) . In Part B, randomized withdrawal, the incidence of infections was similar in the ARCALYST ( 18% ) and the placebo patients ( 22% ) . Part A of the trial was initiated in the winter months, while Part B was predominantly performed in the summer months. In placebo-controlled studies across a variety of patient populations encompassing 360 patients treated with rilonacept and 179 treated with placebo, the incidence of infections was 34% and 27% ( 2.15 per patient-exposure year and 1.81 per patient-exposure year ) , respectively, for rilonacept and placebo. Serious Infections Six serious infections were reported by four patients during the CAPS clinical program: Mycobacterium intracellulare infection; gastrointestinal bleeding and colitis; sinusitis and bronchitis; and Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] One patient receiving ARCALYST for an unapproved indication in another study developed an infection in his olecranon bursa with Mycobacterium intracellulare . The patient was on chronic glucocorticoid treatment. The infection occurred after an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection into the bursa with subsequent local exposure to a suspected source of mycobacteria. The patient recovered after the administration of the appropriate antimicrobial therapy. One patient treated for another unapproved indication developed bronchitis/sinusitis, which resulted in hospitalization. One patient died in an open-label study of CAPS from Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis. Changes in Hematologic Parameters Laboratory Changes One patient in a study in an unapproved indication developed transient neutropenia ( ANC < 1 × 10 9 /L ) after receiving a large dose ( 2000 mg intravenously ) of ARCALYST. The patient did not experience any infection associated with the neutropenia. Lipid Profile Changes Patients with CAPS treated with ARCALYST experienced increases in their mean total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. The mean increases from baseline for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were 19 mg/dL, 2 mg/dL, 10 mg/dL, and 57 mg/dL, respectively, after 6 weeks of open-label therapy. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to the rilonacept receptor domains in specific assays. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to rilonacept with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Antibodies directed against the receptor domains of rilonacept were detected by an ELISA assay in patients with CAPS after treatment with ARCALYST. Nineteen of 55 patients ( 35% ) who had received ARCALYST for at least 6 weeks tested positive for treatment-emergent binding antibodies on at least one occasion. Of the 19, seven tested positive at the last assessment ( Week 18 or 24 of the open-label extension period ) , and five patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies on at least one occasion. There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical effectiveness or safety. In the Phase 3 study of patients with RP, there were no patients who tested positive for antibodies at baseline. At any point in time, 26 out of 86 ( 30% ) subjects tested positive at any assessment and of these, 6 tested positive for neutralizing antibodies ( NAb ) . At the last assessment, 10 subjects remained positive for anti-drug antibodies ( ADA ) and 1 subject remained positive for NAb. There was no correlation of antibody activity and either clinical effectiveness or safety."
