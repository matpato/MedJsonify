    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence The components in lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or one-year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori . Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence (see and CLINICAL STUDIES DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets are contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute interstitial nephritis, and urticaria (see ). Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs), including lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, are contraindicated with rilpivirine-containing products (see ADVERSE REACTIONS CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , ). Drug Interaction Studies A history of severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins) is a contraindication. Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to clarithromycin, erythromycin, or any of the macrolide antibiotics. Clarithromycin is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of clarithromycin. Clarithromycin is contraindicated with concomitant use of lurasidone due to the risk of an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions [(see , PRECAUTIONS ) (7)]. Drug Interactions Clarithromycin should not be given to patients with history of QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmia, including torsades de pointes. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin, a component of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets, and any of the following drugs is contraindicated: cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine or dihydroergotamine (see ). There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when clarithromycin and/or erythromycin are coadministered with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine resulting in cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions torsades de pointes ) most likely due to inhibition of metabolism of these drugs by erythromycin and clarithromycin. Fatalities have been reported. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Clarithromycin should not be used concomitantly with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 (lovastatin or simvastatin), due to the increase risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis (see ). WARNINGS",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy, including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. In the event of severe acute hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets should be discontinued immediately and appropriate treatment should be urgently initiated. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the components of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets: lansoprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin (see ). ADVERSE REACTIONS Monitor closely and discontinue lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets at the first signs of SCAR. Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) Drug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) has been reported with amoxicillin use (see ), with most cases occurring in pediatric patients ≤18 years of age. DIES is a non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction characterized by protracted vomiting occurring 1 to 4 hours after drug ingestion in the absence of skin or respiratory symptoms. DIES may be associated with pallor, lethargy, hypotension, shock, diarrhea within 24 hours after ingesting amoxicillin, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. If DIES occurs, discontinue lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets and institute appropriate therapy. ADVERSE REACTIONS Use in Pregnancy CLARITHROMYCIN SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PREGNANT WOMEN EXCEPT IN CLINICAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE NO ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IS APPROPRIATE. IF PREGNANCY OCCURS WHILE TAKING CLARITHROMYCIN, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS. CLARITHROMYCIN HAS DEMONSTRATED ADVERSE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY OUTCOME AND/OR EMBRYO-FETAL DEVELOPMENT IN MONKEYS, RATS, MICE, AND RABBITS AT DOSES THAT PRODUCED PLASMA LEVELS TWO TO 17 TIMES THE SERUM LEVELS ACHIEVED IN HUMANS TREATED AT THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED HUMAN DOSES (see PRECAUTIONS , Pregnancy ). Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice, has been reported with clarithromycin. This hepatic dysfunction may be severe and is usually reversible. In some instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases and/or concomitant medications. Symptoms of hepatitis can include anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen. Discontinue clarithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur. QT Prolongation Clarithromycin has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving clarithromycin. Fatalities have been reported. Clarithromycin should be avoided in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia (see ) and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. CONTRAINDICATIONS Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with lansoprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been observed in patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) including lansoprazole. Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinue lansoprazole if AIN develops (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including lansoprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations Drug Interactions Serious adverse reactions have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin; hypoglycemia with disopyramide, toxicity with lurasidone, and hypotension and acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine). Most reports of acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 involved elderly patients 65 years of age or older (see and CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS ). Clarithromycin should be used with caution when administered concurrently with medications that induce the cytochrome CYP3A4 enzyme (see Drug Interactions , PRECAUTIONS ). Drug Interactions Colchicine Life-threatening and fatal drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with clarithromycin and colchicine. Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If coadministration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, the dose of colchicine should be reduced. Patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity. Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see and CONTRAINDICATIONS , PRECAUTIONS ). Drug Interactions Benzodiazepines Increased sedation and prolongation of sedation have been reported with concomitant administration of clarithromycin and triazolobenzodiazepines, such as triazolam, and midazolam. Oral Hypoglycemic Agents/Insulin The concomitant use of clarithromycin and oral hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin can result in significant hypoglycemia. With certain hypoglycemic drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause hypoglycemia when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended. Oral Anticoagulants There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in INR and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is co-administered with warfarin. INR and prothrombin times should be frequently monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants concurrently. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins) Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated (see ) as these statins are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4, and concomitant treatment with clarithromycin increases their plasma concentration, which increases the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with these statins. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. CONTRAINDICATIONS Caution should be exercised when prescribing clarithromycin with statins. In situations where the concomitant use of clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin cannot be avoided, atorvastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily and pravastatin dose should not exceed 40 mg daily. Use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism (e.g., fluvastatin) can be considered. It is recommended to prescribe the lowest registered dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided. Antipsychotics Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. Clarithromycin may increase exposure of antipsychotic drugs that are CYP3A substrates including lurasidone, pimozide, quetiapine, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions including the risk of somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, altered mental status, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes ). Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop lansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary (see , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Drug Interaction Studies Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients (see , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Drug Interaction Studies Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clarithromycin and/or amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. In addition, published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy, may be associated with an increased risk of CDAD, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve.PRECAUTIONS General The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfections occur, lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Clarithromycin is principally excreted via the liver and kidney. Clarithromycin may be administered without dosage adjustment to patients with hepatic impairment and normal renal function. However, in the presence of severe renal impairment with or without coexisting hepatic impairment, decreased dosage or prolonged dosing intervals may be appropriate. Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving clarithromycin therapy. Information for Patients Each dose of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets contain four pills: one dark blue and pink capsule (lansoprazole delayed-release capsules), two blue/pink hard gelatin capsules (amoxicillin) and one light yellow tablet (clarithromycin). Each dose should be taken twice per day before eating. Patients should be instructed to swallow each pill whole. Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets may interact with some drugs; therefore patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other medications. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Patients should be advised to immediately report and seek care for diarrhea that does not improve. This may be a sign of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised to immediately report and seek care for any cardiovascular or neurological symptoms including palpitations, dizziness, seizures, and tetany as these may be signs of hypomagnesemia (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to report any symptoms associated with cutaneous or systemic lupus erythematosus (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to report to their healthcare provider if they are taking rilpivirine-containing products or high-dose methotrexate (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations. Instruct patients to stop taking lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets  immediately and promptly report the first signs or symptoms of skin rash, mucosal lesions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Laboratory Tests Amoxicillin Periodic assessment of renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic function should be made during prolonged therapy. Drug Interactions No drug interaction studies have been conducted specifically with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets. The following drug interactions are for the individual drug components: lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. Therefore, the decision to adjust dosage should depend on the clinician’s assessment of among other things, the cumulative or net effect of the drug components of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets. Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules Tables 5 and 6 include drugs with clinically important drug interactions and interaction with diagnostics when administered concomitantly with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules and instructions for preventing or managing them. Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs. Table 5. Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Coadministered with Lansoprazole Delayed-release Capsules and Interactions with Diagnostics Antiretrovirals Clinical Impact: The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with lansoprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance. Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with lansoprazole may increase toxicity of the antiretroviral drugs. There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with lansoprazole. Intervention: Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with lansoprazole is contraindicated (see ). See prescribing information. CONTRAINDICATIONS Atazanavir : See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information. Nelfinavir : Avoid concomitant use with lansoprazole. See prescribing information for nelfinavir. Saquinavir : See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities. Other antiretrovirals : See prescribing information. Warfarin Clinical Impact: Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Intervention: Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin. Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted (see ). WARNINGS Intervention: A temporary withdrawal of lansoprazole may be considered in some patients receiving high-dose methotrexate. Digoxin Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of digoxin. Intervention: Monitor digoxin concentrations. Dose adjustment of digoxin may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for digoxin. Theophylline Clinical Impact: Increased clearance of theophylline (see ). CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Intervention: Individual patients may require additional titration of their theophylline dosage when lansoprazole is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood concentrations. Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Lansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity. Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Coadministration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving lansoprazole delayed-release capsules and MMF. Use lansoprazole delayed-release capsules with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF. See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption. Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin Clinical Impact: Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated. Amoxicillin also has drug interactions. Intervention: See , CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS in prescribing information for clarithromycin. PRECAUTIONS See Drug Interactions in prescribing information for amoxicillin. Tacrolimus Clinical Impact: Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. Intervention: Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Dose adjustment of tacrolimus may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus. Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors Clinical Impact: CgA levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors (see ). , WARNINGS CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Intervention: Temporarily stop lansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary. Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test Clinical Impact: Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma. Intervention: Temporarily stop lansoprazole treatment at least 28 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline (see ). CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY False Positive Urine Tests for THC Clinical Impact: There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs. Intervention: An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. Table 6. Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Lansoprazole Delayed-release Capsules When Coadministered with Other Drugs CYP2C19 OR CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: Decreased exposure of lansoprazole when used concomitantly with strong inducers (see ). CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Intervention: St John's Wort, rifampin : Avoid concomitant use with lansoprazole. Ritonavir-containing products : See prescribing information. CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Increased exposure of lansoprazole is expected when used concomitantly with strong inhibitors (see ). CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Intervention: Voriconazole : See prescribing information. Sucralfate Clinical Impact: Decreased and delayed absorption of lansoprazole (see ). CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Intervention: Take lansoprazole delayed-release capsules at least 30 minutes prior to sucralfate (see ). CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Amoxicillin Probenecid Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. Antibiotics Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro ; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented. Amoxicillin may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives. Table 7. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Clarithromycin Tablets Drugs That Are Affected By Clarithromycin tablets Drug(s) with Pharmacokinetics Affected by Clarithromycin tablets Recommendation Comments Antiarrhythmics: Disopyramide Quinidine Dofetilide Amiodarone Sotalol Procainamide Not Recommended Disopyramide, Quinidine : There have been postmarketing reports of torsades de pointes occurring with concurrent use of clarithromycin and quinidine or disopyramide. Electrocardiograms should be monitored for QTc prolongation during coadministration of clarithromycin with these drugs (see ). Serum concentrations of these medications should also be monitored. There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with disopyramide and quinidine. There have been postmarketing reports of hypoglycemia with the concomitant administration of clarithromycin and disopyramide. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and disopyramide. WARNINGS Digoxin Use With Caution Digoxin : Digoxin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and clarithromycin is known to inhibit Pgp. When clarithromycin and digoxin are coadministered, inhibition of Pgp by clarithromycin may lead to increased exposure of digoxin. Elevated digoxin serum concentrations in patients receiving clarithromycin and digoxin concomitantly have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Some patients have shown clinical signs consistent with digoxin toxicity, including potentially fatal arrhythmias. Monitoring of serum digoxin concentrations should be considered, especially for patients with digoxin concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. Oral Anticoagulants: Warfarin Use With Caution Oral anticoagulants : Spontaneous reports in the postmarketing period suggest that concomitant administration of clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants may potentiate the effects of the oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants simultaneously (see ). WARNINGS Antiepileptics: Carbamazepine Use With Caution Carbamazepine : Concomitant administration of single doses of clarithromycin and carbamazepine has been shown to result in increased plasma concentrations of carbamazepine. Blood level monitoring of carbamazepine may be considered. Increased serum concentrations of carbamazepine were observed in clinical trials with clarithromycin. There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with carbamazepine. Antifungals: Itraconazole Use With Caution Itraconazole : Both clarithromycin and itraconazole are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, potentially leading to a bi-directional drug interaction when administered concomitantly (see also Itraconazole under \"Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets\" in the table below). Clarithromycin may increase the plasma concentrations of itraconazole. Patients taking itraconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged adverse reactions. Fluconazole No Dose Adjustment Fluconazole : No dosage adjustment of clarithromycin is necessary when coadministered with fluconazole. Anti-Gout Agents: Colchicine (in patients with renal or hepatic impairment) Contraindicated Colchicine : Colchicine is a substrate for both CYP3A and the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Clarithromycin and other macrolides are known to inhibit CYP3A and Pgp. The dose of colchicine should be reduced when coadministered with clarithromycin in patients with normal renal and hepatic function (see ). , CONTRAINDICATIONS WARNINGS Colchicine (in patients with normal renal and hepatic function) Use With Caution Antipsychotics: Pimozide Contraindicated Pimozide : (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Lurasidone Lurasidone : (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Quetiapine Quetiapine : Quetiapine is a substrate for CYP3A4, which is inhibited by clarithromycin. Coadministration with clarithromycin could result in increased quetiapine exposure and possible quetiapine related toxicities. There have been postmarketing reports of somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, altered state of consciousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation during concomitant administration. Refer to quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on dose reduction if coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin. Antispasmodics: Tolterodine (patients deficient in CYP2D6 activity) Use With Caution Tolterodine : The primary route of metabolism for tolterodine is via CYP2D6. However, in a subset of the population devoid of CYP2D6, the identified pathway of metabolism is via CYP3A. In this population subset, inhibition of CYP3A results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine. Tolterodine 1 mg twice daily is recommended in patients deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) when coadministered with clarithromycin. Antivirals: Atazanavir Use With Caution Atazanavir : Both clarithromycin and atazanavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, and there is evidence of a bi-directional drug interaction (see Atazanavir under \"Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets\" in the table below). Saquinavir (in patients with decreased renal function) Saquinavir : Both clarithromycin and saquinavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A and there is evidence of a bi-directional drug interaction (see Saquinavir under “Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets” in the table below). Ritonavir Etravirine Ritonavir, Etravirine : (see Ritonavir and Etravirine under \"Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets\" in the table below). Maraviroc Maraviroc : Clarithromycin may result in increases in maraviroc exposures by inhibition of CYP3A metabolism. See Selzentry ® prescribing information for dose recommendation when given with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as clarithromycin. Boceprevir (in patients with normal renal function) No Dose Adjustment Boceprevir : Both clarithromycin and boceprevir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, potentially leading to a bi-directional drug interaction when coadministered. No dose adjustments are necessary for patients with normal renal function (see Victrelis ® prescribing information). Didanosine Zidovudine Zidovudine : Simultaneous oral administration of clarithromycin immediate-release tablets and zidovudine to HIV-infected adult patients may result in decreased steady-state zidovudine concentrations. Administration of clarithromycin and zidovudine should be separated by at least two hours. The impact of coadministration of clarithromycin extended-release tablets or granules and zidovudine has not been evaluated. Calcium Channel Blockers: Verapamil Use With Caution Verapamil : Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil (see ). WARNINGS Amlodipine Diltiazem Amlodipine, Diltiazem : (see ). WARNINGS Nifedipine Nifedipine : Nifedipine is a substrate for CYP3A. Clarithromycin and other macrolides are known to inhibit CYP3A. There is potential of CYP3A-mediated interaction between nifedipine and clarithromycin. Hypotension and peripheral edema were observed when clarithromycin was taken concomitantly with nifedipine (see ). WARNINGS Ergot Alkaloids: Ergotamine Dihydroergotamine Contraindicated Ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine : Postmarketing reports indicate that coadministration of clarithromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Gastroprokinetic Agents: Cisapride Contraindicated Cisapride : (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: Lovastatin Simvastatin Contraindicated Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Atorvastatin, Pravastatin, Fluvastatin : (see ). , CONTRAINDICATIONS WARNINGS Atorvastatin Pravastatin Use With Caution Fluvastatin No Dose Adjustment Hypoglycemic Agents: Nateglinide Pioglitazone Repaglinide Rosiglitazone Use With Caution Nateglinide, Pioglitazone, Repaglinide, Rosiglitazone: (see ). , WARNINGS ADVERSE REACTIONS Insulin Insulin : (see ). , WARNINGS ADVERSE REACTIONS Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine Use With Caution Cyclosporine : There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with cyclosporine. Tacrolimus Tacrolimus : There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with tacrolimus. Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors: Sildenafil Tadalafil Vardenafil Use With Caution Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Vardenafil : Each of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, and CYP3A will be inhibited by concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Coadministration of clarithromycin with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil will result in increased exposure of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Coadministration of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors with clarithromycin is not recommended. Increased systemic exposure of these drugs may occur with clarithromycin; reduction of dosage for phosphodiesterase inhibitors should be considered (see their respective prescribing information). Proton Pump Inhibitors: Omeprazole No Dose Adjustment Omeprazole : The mean 24 hour gastric pH value was 5.2 when omeprazole was administered alone and 5.7 when coadministered with clarithromycin as a result of increased omeprazole exposures (see also Omeprazole under \"Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets\" in the table below). Xanthine Derivatives: Theophylline Use With Caution Theophylline : Clarithromycin use in patients who are receiving theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline concentrations. Monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations should be considered for patients receiving high doses of theophylline or with baseline concentrations in the upper therapeutic range. Triazolobenzodiazepines and Other Related Benzodiazepines: Midazolam Use With Caution Midazolam : When oral midazolam is coadministered with clarithromycin, dose adjustments may be necessary and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated (see ). WARNINGS Alprazolam Triazolam Triazolam, Alprazolam : Caution and appropriate dose adjustments should be considered when triazolam or alprazolam is coadministered with clarithromycin. There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions and central nervous system (CNS) effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Monitoring the patient for increased CNS pharmacological effects is suggested. In postmarketing experience, erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. Temazepam Nitrazepam Lorazepam No Dose Adjustment Temazepam, Nitrazepam, Lorazepam : For benzodiazepines which are not metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam), a clinically important interaction with clarithromycin is unlikely. Cytochrome P450 Inducers: Rifabutin Use With Caution Rifabutin : Concomitant administration of rifabutin and clarithromycin resulted in an increase in rifabutin, and decrease in clarithromycin serum levels together with an increased risk of uveitis (see Rifabutin under \"Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets\" in the table below). Other Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A: Alfentanil Bromocriptine Cilostazol Methylprednisolone Vinblastine Phenobarbital St. John's Wort Use With Caution There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with alfentanil, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, bromocriptine, vinblastine, phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort. Other Drugs Metabolized by CYP450 Isoforms Other than CYP3A: Hexobarbital Phenytoin Valproate Use With Caution There have been postmarketing reports of interactions of clarithromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets Drug(s) that Affect the Pharmacokinetics of Clarithromycin Tablets Recommendation Comments Antifungals: Itraconazole Use With Caution Itraconazole : Itraconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of clarithromycin. Patients taking itraconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged adverse reactions (see also Itraconazole under \"Drugs That Are Affected By Clarithromycin Tablets\" in the table above). Antivirals: Atazanavir Use With Caution Atazanavir : When clarithromycin is coadministered with atazanavir, the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 50%. Since concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is coadministered with atazanavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex. Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be coadministered with protease inhibitors. Ritonavir (in patients with decreased renal function) Ritonavir : Since concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is coadministered with ritonavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium . Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be coadministered with protease inhibitors. Saquinavir (in patients with decreased renal function) Saquinavir : When saquinavir is coadministered with ritonavir, consideration should be given to the potential effects of ritonavir on clarithromycin (refer to ritonavir above). Etravirine Etravirine : Clarithromycin exposure was decreased by etravirine; however, concentrations of the active metabolite, 14-OH-clarithromycin, were increased. Because 14-OH-clarithromycin has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), overall activity against this pathogen may be altered; therefore alternatives to clarithromycin should be considered for the treatment of MAC. Saquinavir (in patients with normal renal function) Ritonavir (in patients with normal renal function) No Dose Adjustment Proton Pump Inhibitors: Omeprazole Use With Caution Omeprazole : Clarithromycin concentrations in the gastric tissue and mucus were also increased by concomitant administration of omeprazole. Miscellaneous Cytochrome P450 Inducers: Efavirenz Nevirapine Rifampicin Rifabutin Rifapentine Use With Caution Inducers of CYP3A enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, rifabutin, and rifapentine will increase the metabolism of clarithromycin, thus decreasing plasma concentrations of clarithromycin, while increasing those of 14-OH-clarithromycin. Since the microbiological activities of clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin are different for different bacteria, the intended therapeutic effect could be impaired during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and enzyme inducers. Alternative antibacterial treatment should be considered when treating patients receiving inducers of CYP3A. There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with rifabutin (see Rifabutin under \"Drugs That Are Affected By Clarithromycin Tablets\" in the table above). Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST, Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with amoxicillin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules In two 24-month carcinogenicity studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with oral lansoprazole at doses of 5 to 150 mg/kg/day, about 0.5 to 20 times the recommended human dose of 60 mg/day, based on body surface area (BSA). Lansoprazole produced dose-related gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia and ECL cell carcinoids in both male and female rats. The incidences of intestinal metaplasia of the gastric epithelium were also increased in both sexes. In male rats, lansoprazole produced a dose-related increase in the incidence of testicular interstitial cell adenomas at doses two to 20 times the recommended human dose of 60 mg/day based on BSA. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study, CD-1 mice were treated with oral lansoprazole at doses of 15 to 600 mg/kg/day (one to 40 times the recommended human dose of 60 mg/day based on BSA comparisons). Lansoprazole produced a dose-related increased incidence of gastric ECL cell hyperplasia. The incidence of liver tumors (hepatocellular adenoma plus carcinoma) was increased in male mice (at doses 20 to 40 times the recommended human dose of 60 mg/day based on BSA) and in female mice (treated at doses ten to 40 times the recommended human dose based on BSA). Lansoprazole treatment produced adenoma of rete testis in male mice receiving doses five to 40 times the recommended human dose of 60 mg/day based on BSA. A 26 week p53 (+/-) transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study was not positive. Lansoprazole was positive in the Ames test and the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay. Lansoprazole was not genotoxic in the ex vivo rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test, the in vivo mouse micronucleus test, or the rat bone marrow cell chromosomal aberration test. Lansoprazole at oral doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (20 times the recommended human dose of 60 mg/day based on BSA) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats. Amoxicillin Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of amoxicillin alone. A 4:1 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. The amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate mixture was also negative in the mouse micronucleus test, and in the dominant lethal assay in mice, but was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay. In a multi-generation reproduction study in rats, no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mg/kg, approximately three times the human dose based on BSA comparisons. Clarithromycin The following in vitro mutagenicity tests have been conducted with clarithromycin: Salmonella /Mammalian Microsomes Test Bacterial Induced Mutation Frequency Test In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test Rat Hepatocyte DNA Synthesis Assay Mouse Lymphoma Assay Mouse Dominant Lethal Study Mouse Micronucleus Test All tests had negative results except the In Vitro Chromosome Aberration Test which was weakly positive in one test and negative in another. In addition, a Bacterial Reverse-Mutation Test (Ames Test) has been performed on clarithromycin metabolites with negative results. Fertility and reproduction studies have shown that daily doses of up to 160 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) to male and female rats caused no adverse effects on the estrous cycle, fertility, parturition, or number and viability of offspring. Plasma levels in rats after 150 mg/kg/day were two times the human serum levels. In the 150 mg/kg/day monkey studies, plasma levels were three times the human serum levels. When given orally at 150 mg/kg/day (2.4 times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ), clarithromycin was shown to produce embryonic loss in monkeys. This effect has been attributed to marked maternal toxicity of the drug at this high dose. In rabbits, in utero fetal loss occurred at an intravenous dose of 33 mg/m 2 , which is 17 times less than the maximum proposed human oral daily dose of 618 mg/m 2 . Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clarithromycin. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Category C is based on the pregnancy category for clarithromycin. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of lansoprazole, clarithromycin or amoxicillin (used separately or together) in pregnant women. Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus and there is no appropriate alternative therapy (see WARNINGS ). Lansoprazole No adverse effects on embryo-fetal development occurred in studies performed in pregnant rats at oral lansoprazole doses up to 150 mg/kg/day (40 times the recommended human dose [30 mg/day] based on body surface area) administered during organogenesis and pregnant rabbits at oral lansoprazole doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (16 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area) administered during organogenesis. A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with lansoprazole at oral doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg/day (0.7 to 6.4 times the maximum recommended human lansoprazole dose of 30 mg based on AUC [area under the plasma concentration-time curve]) administered during organogenesis through lactation. Maternal effects observed at 100 mg/kg/day (6.4 times the maximum recommended human lansoprazole dose of 30 mg based on AUC) included increased gestation period, decreased body weight gain during gestation, and decreased food consumption. The number of stillbirths was increased at this dose, which may have been secondary to maternal toxicity. Body weight of pups was reduced at 100 mg/kg/day starting on postnatal Day 11. Femur weight, femur length, and crown-rump length were reduced at 100 mg/kg/day on postnatal Day 21. Femur weight was still decreased in the 100 mg/kg/day group at age 17 to 18 weeks. Growth plate thickness was decreased in the 100 mg/kg/day males on postnatal Day 21, and was increased in the 30 and 100 mg/kg/day males at age 17 to 18 weeks. The effects on bone parameters were associated with reduction in body weight gain. Amoxicillin Reproduction studies with amoxicillin have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to ten times the human dose and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus. Clarithromycin Four teratogenicity studies in rats with clarithromycin (three with oral doses and one with intravenous doses up to 160 mg/kg/day administered during the period of major organogenesis) and two in rabbits at oral doses up to 125 mg/kg/day (approximately two times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) or intravenous doses of 30 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days six to 18 failed to demonstrate any teratogenicity from clarithromycin. Two additional oral studies in a different rat strain at similar doses and similar conditions demonstrated a low incidence of cardiovascular anomalies at doses of 150 mg/kg/day administered during gestation days six to 15. Plasma levels after 150 mg/kg/day were two times the human serum levels. Four studies in mice revealed a variable incidence of cleft palate following oral doses of 1000 mg/kg/day (two and four times the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) during gestation days six to 15. Cleft palate was also seen at 500 mg/kg/day. The 1000 mg/kg/day exposure resulted in plasma levels 17 times the human serum levels. In monkeys, an oral dose of 70 mg/kg/day (an approximate equidose of the recommended maximum human dose based on mg/m 2 ) produced fetal growth retardation at plasma levels that were two times the human serum levels. Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pigs showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions, but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether use of these drugs in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers Lansoprazole and its metabolites are excreted in the milk of rats. It is not known whether lansoprazole is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets, and the potential for tumorigenicity shown for lansoprazole in rat carcinogenicity studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets, taking into account the importance of the therapy to the mother. Penicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman. Clarithromycin and its active metabolite 14-hydroxy clarithromycin are excreted in human milk. Serum and milk samples were obtained after three days of treatment, at steady state, from one published study of 12 lactating women who were taking clarithromycin 250 mg orally twice daily. Based on the limited data from this study, and assuming milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, an exclusively human milk-fed infant would receive an estimated average of 136 mcg/kg/day of clarithromycin and its active metabolite, with this maternal dosage regimen. This is less than 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose (7.8 mg/kg/day, based on the average maternal weight of 64 kg), and less than 1% of the pediatric dose (15 mg/kg/day) for children greater than six months of age. A prospective observational study of 55 breastfed infants of mothers taking a macrolide antibiotic (six were exposed to clarithromycin) were compared to 36 breastfed infants of mothers taking amoxicillin. Adverse reactions were comparable in both groups. Adverse reactions occurred in 12.7% of infants exposed to macrolides and included rash, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and somnolence. Caution should be exercised when clarithromycin is administered to nursing women. The development and health benefits of human milk feeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clarithromycin and any potential adverse effects on the human milk-fed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets in pediatric patients infected with H. pylori have not been established. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a juvenile rat study, adverse effects on bone growth and development and heart valves were observed at lansoprazole doses higher than the maximum recommended equivalent human dose. An eight-week oral toxicity study with a four-week recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats, with lansoprazole administered from postnatal Day 7 (age equivalent to neonatal humans) through 62 (age equivalent to approximately 14 years in humans) at doses of 40 to 500 mg/kg/day (about 1.2 to 12 times the daily pediatric dose of 15 mg in children age one to 11 years weighing 30 kg or less, based on AUC). Heart valve thickening occurred at a dose of 500 mg/kg/day (approximately 12 times the daily dose of 15 mg in pediatric patients age one to 11 years weighing 30 kg or less, based on AUC). Heart valve thickening was not observed at the next lower dose (250 mg/kg/day) and below. The findings trended towards reversibility after a four-week drug-free recovery period. The relevance of heart valve thickening in this study to pediatric patients less than approximately 12 years of age is unknown. These findings are not relevant for patients 12 years of age and older. No effects on heart valves were observed in a 13-week intravenous toxicity study of lansoprazole in adolescent rats (approximately 12 years human age equivalence) at systemic exposures similar to those achieved in the eight-week oral toxicity study in juvenile (neonatal) rats. In the eight-week oral toxicity study, doses equal to or greater than 100 mg/kg/day (about 2.5 times the daily pediatric dose of 15 mg in children age one to 11 years weighing 30 kg or less, based on AUC) produced delayed growth, with impairment of weight gain observed as early as postnatal Day 10 (age equivalent to neonatal humans). At the end of treatment, the signs of impaired growth at 100 mg/kg/day and higher included reductions in body weight (14% to 44% compared to controls), absolute weight of multiple organs, femur weight, femur length, and crown-rump length. Femoral growth plate thickness was reduced only in males and only at the 500 mg/kg/day dose. The effects related to delayed growth persisted through the end of the 4- week recovery period. Longer term data were not collected. Geriatric Use Elderly patients may suffer from asymptomatic renal and hepatic dysfunction. Care should be taken when administering lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin capsules, and clarithromycin tablets to this patient population. An analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects. These analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Amoxicillin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. In a steady-state study in which healthy elderly subjects (age 65 to 81 years old) were given 500 mg of clarithromycin every 12 hours, the maximum serum concentrations and area under the curves of clarithromycin and 14-OH clarithromycin were increased compared to those achieved in healthy young adults. These changes in pharmacokinetics parallel known age-related decreases in renal function. In clinical trials of clarithromycin, elderly patients did not have an increased incidence of adverse events when compared to younger patients. Dosage adjustment should be considered in elderly patients with severe renal impairment. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients (see and WARNINGS ). PRECAUTIONS Most reports of acute kidney injury with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem, nifedipine) involved elderly patients 65 years of age or older (see ).

    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS LANSOPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE CAPSULES, AMOXICILLIN CAPSULES, AND CLARITHROMYCIN TABLETS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The most common adverse reactions (≥3%) reported in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly for 14 days are listed in Table 8. Table 8: Adverse Reactions Most Frequently Reported in Clinical Trials (≥3%) Adverse Reaction Triple Therapy n = 138 (%) Diarrhea 7.0 Headache 6.0 Taste Perversion 5.0 The additional adverse reactions which were reported as possibly or probably related to treatment (less than 3%) in clinical trials when all three components of this therapy were given concomitantly are listed below and divided by body system: Body as a Whole - abdominal pain Digestive System - dark stools, dry mouth/thirst, glossitis, rectal itching, nausea, oral moniliasis, stomatitis, tongue discoloration, tongue disorder, vomiting Musculoskeletal System - myalgia Nervous System - confusion, dizziness Respiratory System - respiratory disorders Skin and Appendages - skin reactions Urogenital System - vaginitis, vaginal moniliasis There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of reported adverse events between the 10 and 14 day triple therapy regimens. Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules The following adverse reactions from the labeling for lansoprazole delayed-release capsules are provided for information: Worldwide, over 10,000 patients have been treated with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials involving various dosages and durations of treatment. In general, lansoprazole delayed-release capsules treatment has been well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term trials. Incidence in Clinical Trials The following adverse events were reported by the treating physician to have a possible or probable relationship to drug in 1% or more of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules-treated patients and occurred at a greater rate in lansoprazole delayed-release capsules-treated patients than placebo-treated patients: Table 9: Incidence of Possibly or Probably Treatment-Related Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules Studies Body System/Adverse Event Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules (N=2768) % Placebo (N=1023) % Body as a Whole Abdominal Pain 2.1 1.2 Digestive System Constipation 1.0 0.4 Diarrhea 3.8 2.3 Nausea 1.3 1.2 Headache was also seen at greater than 1% incidence but was more common on placebo. The incidence of diarrhea was similar between patients who received placebo and patients who received 30 mg of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, but higher in the patients who received 60 mg of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules (2.9%, 4.2%, and 7.4%, respectively). The most commonly reported possibly or probably treatment-related adverse event during maintenance therapy was diarrhea.

OVERDOSAGE Hemic and Lymphatic Systems – Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Central Nervous System – Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, behavioral changes, and/or dizziness have been reported rarely. Miscellaneous – Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been rarely reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases. Clarithromycin The following adverse reactions from the labeling for clarithromycin are provided for information: The most frequent and common adverse reactions related to clarithromycin therapy for both adult and pediatric populations are abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. These adverse reactions are consistent with the known safety profile of macrolide antibiotics. There was no significant difference in the incidence of these gastrointestinal adverse reactions during clinical trials between the patient population with or without preexisting mycobacterial infections. Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trials of Clarithromycin The following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials with clarithromycin at a rate greater than or equal to 1%: Gastrointestinal Disorders – Diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain Hepatobiliary Disorders – Liver function test abnormal Immune System Disorders – Anaphylactoid reaction Infections and Infestations – Candidiasis Nervous System Disorders – Dysgeusia, headache Psychiatric Disorders – Insomnia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders – Rash Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trials of Clarithromycin The following adverse reactions were observed in clinical trials with clarithromycin at a rate less than 1%: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders – Leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocythemia, eosinophilia Cardiac Disorders – Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, extrasystoles, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders – Vertigo, tinnitus, hearing impaired Gastrointestinal Disorders – Stomatitis, glossitis, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritis, proctalgia, abdominal distention, constipation, dry mouth, eructation, flatulence General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions – Malaise, pyrexia, asthma, chest pain, chills, fatigue Hepatobiliary Disorders – Cholestasis, hepatitis Immune System Disorders – Hypersensitivity Infections and Infestations – Cellulitis, gastroenteritis, infection, vaginal infection Investigations – Blood bilirubin increased, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, albumin globulin ratio abnormal Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders – Anorexia, decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders – Myalgia, muscle spasms, nuchal rigidity Nervous System Disorders – Dizziness, tremor, loss of consciousness, dyskinesia, somnolence Psychiatric Disorders – Anxiety, nervousness Renal and Urinary Disorders – Blood creatinine increased, blood urea increased Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders – Asthma, epistaxis, pulmonary embolism Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders – Urticaria, dermatitis bollus, pruritus, hyperhidrosis, rash maculopapular The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of clarithromycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders – Thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis Cardiac Disorders – Torsades de pointes , ventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmia Ear and Labyrinth Disorders – Deafness was reported chiefly in elderly women and was usually reversible. Gastrointestinal Disorders – Pancreatitis acute, tongue discoloration, tooth discoloration was reported and was usually reversible with professional cleaning upon discontinuation of the drug. Hepatobiliary Disorders – Hepatic failure, jaundice hepatocellular. Adverse reactions related to hepatic dysfunction have been reported with clarithromycin (see , WARNINGS ) Hepatotoxicity Immune System Disorders – Anaphylactic reaction Infections and Infestations – Pseudomembranous colitis Investigations – Prothrombin time prolonged, white blood cell count decreased, international normalized ratio increased. Abnormal urine color has been reported, associated with hepatic failure. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders – Hypoglycemia has been reported in patients taking oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders – Myopathy, rhabdomyolysis was reported and in some of the reports, clarithromycin was administered concomitantly with statins, fibrates, colchicines or allopurinol (see and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). WARNINGS Nervous System Disorders – Convulsion, ageusia, parosmia, anosmia, paresthesia Psychiatric Disorders – Psychotic disorder, confusional state, depersonalization, depression, disorientation, manic behavior, hallucination, abnormal behavior, abnormal dreams. These disorders usually resolve upon discontinuation of the drug. There are no data on the effect of clarithromycin on the ability to drive or use machines. The potential for dizziness, vertigo, confusion and disorientation, which may occur with the medication, should be taken into account before patients drive or use machines. Renal and Urinary Disorders – Nephritis interstitial, renal failure Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders – Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Henoch-Schonlein purpura, acne Vascular Disorders – Hemorrhage There have been reports of colchicine toxicity with concomitant use of clarithromycin and colchicine, especially in the elderly, some of which occurred in patients with renal insufficiency. Deaths have been reported in some such patients (see and WARNINGS ). PRECAUTIONS Laboratory Values Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules The following changes in laboratory parameters in patients who received lansoprazole delayed-release capsules were reported as adverse reactions: Abnormal liver function tests, increased SGOT (AST), increased SGPT (ALT), increased creatinine, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased globulins, increased GGTP, increased/decreased/abnormal WBC, abnormal AG ratio, abnormal RBC, bilirubinemia, blood potassium increased, blood urea increased, crystal urine present, eosinophilia, hemoglobin decreased, hyperlipemia, increased/decreased electrolytes, increased/decreased cholesterol, increased glucocorticoids, increased LDH, increased/decreased/abnormal platelets, increased gastrin levels and positive fecal occult blood. Urine abnormalities such as albuminuria, glycosuria, and hematuria were also reported. In the placebo-controlled studies, when SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) were evaluated, 0.4% (4/978) and 0.4% (11/2677) patients, who received placebo and lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, respectively, had enzyme elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal range at the final treatment visit. None of these patients who received lansoprazole delayed-release capsules reported jaundice at any time during the study."
