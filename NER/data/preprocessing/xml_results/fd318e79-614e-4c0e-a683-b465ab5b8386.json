    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ganirelix acetate is contraindicated under the following conditions: Known hypersensitivity to ganirelix acetate or to any of its components including dry natural rubber/latex (see ). HOW SUPPLIED Known hypersensitivity to GnRH or any other GnRH analog. Known or suspected pregnancy (see ). PRECAUTIONS",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Ganirelix acetate injection should be prescribed by physicians who are experienced in infertility treatment. Before starting treatment with ganirelix acetate, pregnancy must be excluded. Safe use of ganirelix acetate during pregnancy has not been established (see and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). PRECAUTIONSPRECAUTIONS General Special care should be taken in women with signs and symptoms of active allergic conditions. Cases of hypersensitivity reactions (both generalized and local), including anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock), angioedema and urticaria, have been reported with ganirelix acetate, as early as with the first dose, during post-marketing surveillance (see ). If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, ganirelix acetate should be discontinued and appropriate treatment administered. In the absence of clinical experience, ganirelix acetate treatment is not advised in women with severe allergic conditions. ADVERSE REACTIONS The rigid needle shield of this product is not made with natural rubber/latex (see and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). HOW SUPPLIED Information for Patients Prior to therapy with ganirelix acetate, patients should be informed of the duration of treatment and monitoring procedures that will be required. The risk of possible adverse reactions should be discussed (see ). ADVERSE REACTIONS Ganirelix acetate should not be prescribed if the patient is pregnant. Laboratory Tests A neutrophil count ≥ 8.3 (x 10 9 /L) was noted in 11.9% (up to 16.8 x 10 9 /L) of all subjects treated within the adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. In addition, downward shifts within the ganirelix acetate group were observed for hematocrit and total bilirubin. The clinical significance of these findings was not determined. Drug Interactions No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term toxicity studies in animals have not been performed with ganirelix acetate to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the drug. Ganirelix acetate did not induce a mutagenic response in the Ames test (S. typhimurium and E. coli ) or produce chromosomal aberrations in in vitro assay using Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Pregnancy Ganirelix acetate is contraindicated in pregnant women. When administered from Day 7 to near term to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 10 and 30 mcg/day (approximately 0.4 to 3.2 times the human dose based on body surface area), ganirelix acetate increased the incidence of litter resorption. There was no increase in fetal abnormalities. No treatment-related changes in fertility, physical, or behavioral characteristics were observed in the offspring of female rats treated with ganirelix acetate during pregnancy and lactation. The effects on fetal resorption are logical consequences of the alteration in hormonal levels brought about by the antigonadotropic properties of this drug and could result in fetal loss in humans. Therefore, this drug should not be used in pregnant women (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Nursing Mothers Ganirelix acetate should not be used by lactating women. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Geriatric Use Clinical studies with ganirelix acetate did not include a sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of ganirelix acetate was evaluated in two randomized, parallel-group, multicenter controlled clinical studies. Treatment duration for ganirelix acetate ranged from 1 to 14 days. Table IV represents adverse events (AEs) from first day of ganirelix acetate administration until confirmation of pregnancy by ultrasound at an incidence of ≥ 1% in ganirelix acetate-treated subjects without regard to causality. TABLE IV: Incidence of common adverse events (Incidence ≥ 1% in ganirelix acetate-treated subjects). Completed controlled clinical studies (All-subjects-treated group). Adverse Events Occurring in ≥ 1% Ganirelix Acetate N=794 % (n) Abdominal Pain (gynecological) 4.8 (38) Death Fetal 3.7 (29) Headache 3.0 (24) Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome 2.4 (19) Vaginal Bleeding 1.8 (14) Injection Site Reaction 1.1 (9) Nausea 1.1 (9) Abdominal Pain (gastrointestinal) 1.0 (8) During post-marketing surveillance, rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock), angioedema and urticaria have been reported with ganirelix acetate, as early as with the first dose (see ). PRECAUTIONS Congenital Anomalies An observational study in more than 1,000 newborns compared the incidence of congenital anomalies in newborns of women administered ganirelix acetate to historical controls of a GnRH agonist. This study demonstrated that the incidence of congenital anomalies in children born after COH treatment in women using ganirelix acetate was comparable with that reported after a COH treatment cycle using a GnRH agonist. The incidence of congenital malformations after some Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) [specifically in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conception. This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, maternal and paternal genetic background, sperm characteristics) and to the higher incidence of multi-fetal gestations after IVF or ICSI. The causal relationship between these congenital anomalies and ganirelix acetate injection is unknown."
