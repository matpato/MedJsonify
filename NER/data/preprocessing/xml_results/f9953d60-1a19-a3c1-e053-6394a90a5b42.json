  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Losartan potassium tablet is an angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) indicated for: Treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and children greater than 6 years old. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1.1 ) Reduction of the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. There is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients. ( 1.2 ) Treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of hypertension. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Hypertension Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular ( CV ) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ( JNC ) . Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension ( for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia ) , and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects ( as monotherapy ) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects ( e.g. , on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease ) . These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Losartan potassium tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Losartan potassium tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, but there is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 1.3 Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria ( urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ≥300 mg/g ) in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of hypertension. In this population, losartan potassium tablet reduces the rate of progression of nephropathy as measured by the occurrence of doubling of serum creatinine or end stage renal disease ( need for dialysis or renal transplantation ) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ] .",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Losartan potassium tablets, are contraindicated: In patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. For coadministration with aliskiren in patients with diabetes. Hypersensitivity to any component. ( 4 ) Coadministration with aliskiren in patients with diabetes. ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of losartan potassium tablets. ( 5.2 ) Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients. ( 5.3 , 5.4 ) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Losartan potassium tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue losartan potassium tablets as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] . 5.2 Hypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients ( e.g. , those being treated with high doses of diuretics ) , symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with losartan potassium tablets. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of losartan potassium tablets [see . ] Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) 5.3 Renal Function Deterioration Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system ( e.g. , patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion ) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on losartan potassium tablets. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on losartan potassium tablets [see . and Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ] Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) 5.4 Hyperkalemia Monitor serum potassium periodically and treat appropriately. Dosage reduction or discontinuation of losartan potassium tablets may be required [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] Concomitant use of other drugs that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia [see . ] Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥2% and greater than placebo ) are: dizziness, upper respiratory infection, nasal congestion, and back pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Granules Pharmaceuticals Inc at 1-877-770-3183 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypertension Losartan potassium tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 3300 adult patients treated for essential hypertension and 4058 patients/subjects overall. Over 1200 patients were treated for over 6 months and more than 800 for over one year. Treatment with losartan potassium tablets was well-tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo. In controlled clinical trials, discontinuation of therapy for adverse events occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with losartan potassium tablets and 3.7% of patients given placebo. In 4 clinical trials involving over 1000 patients on various doses ( 10 to 150 mg ) of losartan potassium and over 300 patients given placebo, the adverse events that occurred in ≥2% of patients treated with losartan potassium tablets and more commonly than placebo were: dizziness ( 3% vs. 2% ) , upper respiratory infection ( 8% vs. 7% ) , nasal congestion ( 2% vs. 1% ) , and back pain ( 2% vs. 1% ) . The following less common adverse reactions have been reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia. Psychiatric disorders: Depression. Nervous system disorders: Somnolence, headache, sleep disorders, paresthesia, migraine. Ear and labyrinth disorders : Vertigo, tinnitus. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations, syncope, atrial fibrillation, CVA. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Dyspnea. Gastrointestinal disorders : Abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, vomiting. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Urticaria, pruritus, rash, photosensitivity. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : Myalgia, arthralgia. Reproductive system and breast disorders : Impotence. General disorders and administration site conditions : Edema. Cough Persistent dry cough ( with an incidence of a few percent ) has been associated with ACE-inhibitor use and in practice can be a cause of discontinuation of ACE-inhibitor therapy. Two prospective, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who had experienced cough while receiving ACE-inhibitor therapy. Patients who had typical ACE-inhibitor cough when challenged with lisinopril, whose cough disappeared on placebo, were randomized to losartan 50 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, or either placebo ( one study, n=97 ) or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide ( n=135 ) . The double-blind treatment period lasted up to 8 weeks. The incidence of cough is shown in Table 1 below. Table1: Study 1* HCTZ Losartan Lisinopril Cough 25% 17% 69% Study 2 † Placebo Losartan Lisinopril Cough 35% 29% 62% * Demographics = ( 89% Caucasian, 64% female ) Demographics = ( 90% Caucasian, 51% female ) † These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy, in a population that all had cough associated with ACE-inhibitor therapy, is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy. Cases of cough, including positive re-challenges, have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience. Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy In the losartan Intervention for Endpoint ( LIFE ) study, adverse reactions with losartan potassium tablets were similar to those reported previously for patients with hypertension. Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonist Losartan ( RENAAL ) study involving 1.513 patients treated with losartan potassium tablets or placebo, the overall incidences of reported adverse events were similar for the two groups. Discontinuations of losartan potassium tablets because of side effects were similar to placebo ( 19% for losartan potassium tablets 24% for placebo ) . The adverse events, regardless of drug relationship, reported with an incidence of ≥4% of patients treated with losartan potassium tablets and occurring with ≥2% difference in the losartan group vs. placebo on a background of conventional antihypertensive therapy, were asthenia/fatigue, chest pain, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, diarrhea, anemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, back pain, muscular weakness, and urinary tract infection. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience with losartan potassium tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Digestive: Hepatitis. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Malaise. Hematologic : Thrombocytopenia. Hypersensitivity: Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling of the face, lips, pharynx, and/or tongue has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan; some of these patients previously experienced angioedema with other drugs including ACE inhibitors. Vasculitis, including Henoch-Schönlein purpura, has been reported. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Metabolic and Nutrition: Hyponatremia. Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis. Nervous system disorders: Dysgeusia. Skin: Erythroderma."
