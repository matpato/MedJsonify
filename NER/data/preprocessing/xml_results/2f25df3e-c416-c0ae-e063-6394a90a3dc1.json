( 2.2 , 5.1 , 8.5, 8.6 ) GI Malignancy : Absence of GI symptoms does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy; evaluate prior to initiating therapy. ( 5.2 ) 5.1  Central Nervous System\nAdverse Reactions Central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions, including confusion, delirium, hallucinations, disorientation, agitation, seizures, and lethargy, have been reported in elderly patients and patients with moderate and severe renal impairment treated with famotidine tablets. Since famotidine blood levels are higher in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function, dosage adjustments are recommended in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.2  Concurrent\nGastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with famotidine tablets does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider evaluation for gastric malignancy in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with famotidine tablets.",

Famotidine tablets was studied in 7 US and international placebo- and active-controlled trials in approximately 2500 patients [see Clinical Studies ( . A total of 1442 patients were treated with famotidine tablets, including 302 treated with 40 mg twice daily, 456 treated with 20 mg twice daily, 461 treated with 40 mg once daily, and 396 treated with 20 mg once daily. The population was 17-91 years old, fairly well distributed between gender and race; however, the predominant race treated was Caucasian. 14 )] The following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of famotidine tablets-treated patients: headache, dizziness and constipation. The following other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials: Body as a Whole: fever, asthenia, fatigue Cardiovascular: palpitations Gastrointestinal: elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth Hematologic: thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: orbital edema, rash, conjunctival injection, bronchospasm Musculoskeletal: musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia Nervous System/Psychiatric: seizure, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, decreased libido, insomnia, somnolence Skin: pruritus, dry skin, flushing Special Senses: tinnitus, taste disorder Other: impotence 6.2  Postmarketing\nExperience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of famotidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, AV block, prolonged QT interval Gastrointestinal: cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis Hematologic: agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, facial edema, urticaria Musculoskeletal: rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramps Nervous System/Psychiatric: confusion, agitation, paresthesia Respiratory: interstitial pneumonia Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome"
