    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT Prolongation: Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or with arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval ( 5.3 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Discontinue if this occurs ( 5.4 ) Akathisia, agitation, restlessness, and parkinsonism: Reduce dose or discontinue if this occurs ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Sedation/somnolence: May impair the patient’s ability to drive or operate complex machinery ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Depression and Suicidality in Patients with Huntington’s Disease Patients with Huntington’s disease are at increased risk for depression, and suicidal ideation or behaviors (suicidality). AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may increase the risk for suicidality in patients with Huntington’s disease. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, suicidal ideation was reported by 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO, compared to no patients on placebo; no suicide attempts and no completed suicides were reported. Depression was reported by 4% of patients treated with AUSTEDO. When considering the use of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO, the risk of suicidality should be balanced against the need for treatment of chorea. All patients treated with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO should be observed for new or worsening depression or suicidality. If depression or suicidality does not resolve, consider discontinuing treatment with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the risks of depression, worsening depression, and suicidality associated with AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO, and should be instructed to report behaviors of concern promptly to the treating physician. Patients with Huntington’s disease who express suicidal ideation should be evaluated immediately. 5.2 Clinical Worsening and Adverse Events in Patients with Huntington’s Disease Huntington’s disease is a progressive disorder characterized by changes in mood, cognition, chorea, rigidity, and functional capacity over time. VMAT2 inhibitors, including AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO, may cause a worsening in mood, cognition, rigidity, and functional capacity. Prescribers should periodically re-evaluate the need for AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO in their patients by assessing the effect on chorea and possible adverse effects, including sedation/somnolence, depression and suicidality, parkinsonism, akathisia, restlessness, and cognitive decline. It may be difficult to distinguish between adverse reactions and progression of the underlying disease; decreasing the dose or stopping the drug may help the clinician to distinguish between the two possibilities. In some patients, the underlying chorea itself may improve over time, decreasing the need for AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO. 5.3 QTc Prolongation AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may prolong the QT interval, but the degree of QT prolongation is not clinically significant when AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is administered within the recommended dosage range [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with drugs that reduce dopaminergic transmission. While NMS has not been observed in patients receiving AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO, it has been observed in patients receiving tetrabenazine (a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor). Clinicians should be alerted to the signs and symptoms associated with NMS. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The diagnosis of NMS can be complicated; other serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal disorders can present with similar signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system pathology. The management of NMS should include (1) immediate discontinuation of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO; (2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and (3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. Recurrence of NMS has been reported with resumption of drug therapy. If treatment with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is needed after recovery from NMS, patients should be monitored for signs of recurrence. 5.5 Akathisia, Agitation, and Restlessness AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may increase the risk of akathisia, agitation, and restlessness in patients with Huntington’s disease and tardive dyskinesia. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with Huntington’s disease, akathisia, agitation, or restlessness was reported by 4% of patients treated with AUSTEDO, compared to 2% of patients on placebo; in patients with tardive dyskinesia, 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO and 1% of patients on placebo experienced these events. Patients receiving AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO should be monitored for signs and symptoms of restlessness and agitation, as these may be indicators of developing akathisia. If a patient develops akathisia during treatment with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO, the AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy. 5.6 Parkinsonism AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may cause parkinsonism in patients with Huntington’s disease or tardive dyskinesia. Parkinsonism has also been observed with other VMAT2 inhibitors. Because rigidity can develop as part of the underlying disease process in Huntington’s disease, it may be difficult to distinguish between potential drug-induced parkinsonism and progression of underlying Huntington’s disease. Drug-induced parkinsonism has the potential to cause more functional disability than untreated chorea for some patients with Huntington’s disease. Postmarketing cases of parkinsonism in patients treated with AUSTEDO for tardive dyskinesia have been reported. Signs and symptoms in reported cases have included bradykinesia, gait disturbances, which led to falls in some cases, and the emergence or worsening of tremor. In most cases, the development of parkinsonism occurred within the first two weeks after starting or increasing the dose of AUSTEDO. In cases in which follow-up clinical information was available, parkinsonism was reported to resolve following discontinuation of AUSTEDO therapy. If a patient develops parkinsonism during treatment with AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO, the AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO dose should be reduced; some patients may require discontinuation of therapy. 5.7 Sedation and Somnolence Sedation is a common dose-limiting adverse reaction of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining patients with Huntington’s disease, 11% of AUSTEDO-treated patients reported somnolence compared with 4% of patients on placebo and 9% of AUSTEDO-treated patients reported fatigue compared with 4% of placebo-treated patients. Patients should not perform activities requiring mental alertness to maintain the safety of themselves or others, such as operating a motor vehicle or operating hazardous machinery, until they are on a maintenance dose of AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO and know how the drug affects them. 5.8 Hyperprolactinemia Serum prolactin levels were not evaluated in the AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO development program. Tetrabenazine, a closely related VMAT2 inhibitor, elevates serum prolactin concentrations in humans. Following administration of 25 mg of tetrabenazine to healthy volunteers, peak plasma prolactin levels increased 4- to 5-fold. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if AUSTEDO XR or AUSTEDO is being considered for a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence can be caused by elevated serum prolactin concentrations, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin concentrations for most patients is unknown. Chronic increase in serum prolactin levels (although not evaluated in the AUSTEDO XR, AUSTEDO, or tetrabenazine development programs) has been associated with low levels of estrogen and increased risk of osteoporosis. If there is a clinical suspicion of symptomatic hyperprolactinemia, appropriate laboratory testing should be done and consideration should be given to discontinuation of AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO. 5.9 Binding to Melanin-Containing Tissues Since deutetrabenazine or its metabolites bind to melanin-containing tissues, it could accumulate in these tissues over time. This raises the possibility that AUSTEDO XR and AUSTEDO may cause toxicity in these tissues after extended use. Neither ophthalmologic nor microscopic examination of the eye has been conducted in the chronic toxicity studies in a pigmented species such as dogs. Ophthalmologic monitoring in humans was inadequate to exclude the possibility of injury occurring after long-term exposure. The clinical relevance of deutetrabenazine’s binding to melanin-containing tissues is unknown. Although there are no specific recommendations for periodic ophthalmologic monitoring, prescribers should be aware of the possibility of long-term ophthalmologic effects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )].",

The studies described below were conducted with AUSTEDO tablets; adverse reactions with AUSTEDO XR extended-release tablets are expected to be similar to AUSTEDO tablets. Patients with Huntington’s Disease Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( was a randomized, 12-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with Huntington’s disease. A total of 45 patients received AUSTEDO, and 45 patients received placebo. Patients ranged in age between 23 and 74 years (mean 54 years); 56% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 8% of AUSTEDO-treated patients were somnolence, diarrhea, dry mouth, and fatigue. Adverse reactions occurring in 4% or more of patients treated with AUSTEDO, and with a greater incidence than in patients on placebo, are summarized in Table 3. 14.1 )] Table 3: Adverse Reactions in Patients with Huntington's Disease (Study 1) Experienced by at Least 4% of Patients on AUSTEDO and with a Greater Incidence than on Placebo Adverse Reaction AUSTEDO (N = 45) % Placebo (N = 45) % Somnolence 11 4 Diarrhea 9 0 Dry mouth 9 7 Fatigue 9 4 Urinary tract infection 7 2 Insomnia 7 4 Anxiety 4 2 Constipation 4 2 Contusion 4 2 One or more adverse reactions resulted in a reduction of the dose of study medication in 7% of patients in Study 1. The most common adverse reaction resulting in dose reduction in patients receiving AUSTEDO was dizziness (4%). Agitation led to discontinuation in 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO in Study 1. Patients with Tardive Dyskinesia The data described below reflect 410 tardive dyskinesia patients participating in clinical trials. AUSTEDO was studied primarily in two 12-week, placebo-controlled trials (fixed dose, dose escalation) [see Clinical Studies ( . The population was 18 to 80 years of age, and had tardive dyskinesia and had concurrent diagnoses of mood disorder (33%) or schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (63%). In these studies, AUSTEDO was administered in doses ranging from 12-48 mg per day. All patients continued on previous stable regimens of antipsychotics; 71% and 14% respective atypical and typical antipsychotic medications at study entry. 14.2 )] The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 3% of AUSTEDO-treated patients and greater than placebo were nasopharyngitis and insomnia. The adverse reactions occurring in >2% or more patients treated with AUSTEDO (12-48 mg per day) and greater than in placebo patients in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with tardive dyskinesia (Study 1 and Study 2) are summarized in Table 4. Table 4: Adverse Reactions in 2 Placebo-Controlled Tardive Dyskinesia Studies (Study 1 and Study 2) of 12-week Treatment on AUSTEDO Reported in at Least 2% of Patients and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction AUSTEDO (N=279) (%) Placebo (N=131) (%) Nasopharyngitis 4 2 Insomnia 4 1 Depression/ Dysthymic disorder 2 1 Akathisia/Agitation/Restlessness 2 1 One or more adverse reactions resulted in a reduction of the dose of study medication in 4% of AUSTEDO-treated patients and in 2% of placebo-treated patients."
