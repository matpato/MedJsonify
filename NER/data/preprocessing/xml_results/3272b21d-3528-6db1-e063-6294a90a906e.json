    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypocortisolism : Decreases in circulating levels of cortisol may occur resulting in biochemical and/or clinical hypocortisolism. SIGNIFOR dose reduction or interruption and/or adding a low-dose short-term glucocorticoid may be necessary ( 5.1 ) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes (occurs with initiation) : Intensive glucose monitoring is recommended and may require initiation or adjustment of anti-diabetic treatment per standard of care ( 5.2 ) Bradycardia and QT Prolongation : Use with caution in at-risk patients; ECG testing prior to dosing and on treatment ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Liver Test Elevations : Evaluate liver tests prior to and during treatment ( 5.4 ) Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis : Monitor periodically. Discontinue if complications of cholelithiasis are suspected ( 5.5 ) 5.1       Hypocortisolism Treatment with SIGNIFOR leads to suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion in Cushing's disease. Suppression of ACTH may lead to a decrease in circulating levels of cortisol and potentially hypocortisolism. Monitor and instruct patients on the signs and symptoms associated with hypocortisolism (e.g., weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hyponatremia, or hypoglycemia). If hypocortisolism occurs, consider temporary dose reduction or interruption of treatment with SIGNIFOR, as well as temporary, exogenous glucocorticoid replacement therapy. 5.2       Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Blood glucose elevations have been seen in healthy volunteers and patients treated with SIGNIFOR. In the clinical study [see Clinical Studies (14)] , patients developed pre-diabetes and diabetes. Nearly all patients in the study, including those with normal glucose status at baseline, pre-diabetes, and diabetes, developed worsening glycemia in the first two weeks of treatment. Cushing's disease patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 8%) may be at a higher risk of developing severe hyperglycemia and associated complications, e.g., ketoacidosis. Assess the patient's glycemic status prior to starting treatment with SIGNIFOR. In patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, optimize anti-diabetic therapy prior to SIGNIFOR initiation. Glycemic monitoring should be done every week for the first two to three months and periodically thereafter, as well as over the first two to four weeks after any dose increase. If hyperglycemia develops, initiate or adjust anti-diabetic treatment per standard of care. If uncontrolled hyperglycemia persists despite appropriate treatment, reduce the dose or discontinue SIGNIFOR and perform glycemic monitoring according to clinical practice. Patients who were initiated on anti-diabetic treatment as a result of SIGNIFOR require closer monitoring after discontinuation of SIGNIFOR, especially if the anti-diabetic therapy has a risk of causing hypoglycemia. 5.3       Bradycardia and QT Prolongation Bradycardia Bradycardia has been reported with the use of SIGNIFOR [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be carefully monitored. Dose adjustments of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary. QT Prolongation SIGNIFOR is associated with QT prolongation. In two thorough QT studies with SIGNIFOR, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. SIGNIFOR should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as those: with congenital long QT prolongation. with uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or clinically significant bradycardia. on anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances that are known to lead to QT prolongation. with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia. A baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy with SIGNIFOR and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to SIGNIFOR administration and should be monitored periodically during therapy. 5.4       Liver Test Elevations In the Phase III trial, 5% of patients had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the entire clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 cases of concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with Cushing's disease and 3 healthy volunteers [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . In these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation. Monitoring of liver tests should be done after 1- to 2 weeks on treatment, then monthly for 3 months, and every 6 months thereafter. If ALT is normal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3-5 times the ULN are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or within 48 hours if exceeding 5 times ULN. If ALT is abnormal at baseline and elevations of ALT of 3 to 5 times the baseline values are observed on treatment, repeat the test within a week or sooner if exceeding 5 times ULN. Tests should be done in a laboratory that can provide same-day results. If the values are confirmed or rising, interrupt SIGNIFOR treatment and investigate for probable cause of the findings, which may or may not be SIGNIFOR-related. Serial measures of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, should be done weekly, or more frequently, if any value exceeds 5 times the baseline value in case of abnormal baselines, or 5 times the ULN in case of normal baselines. If resolution of abnormalities to normal or near normal occurs, resuming treatment with SIGNIFOR may be done cautiously, with close observation, and only if some other likely cause has been found. 5.5       Cholelithiasis and Complications of Cholelithiasis Cholelithiasis has been frequently reported in clinical studies with SIGNIFOR [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . There have been postmarketing reports of cholelithiasis (gallstones) resulting in complications, including cholecystitis or cholangitis and requiring cholecystectomy in patients taking SIGNIFOR. Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder before, and periodically during SIGNIFOR therapy is recommended. If complications of cholelithiasis are suspected, discontinue SIGNIFOR and treat appropriately. 5.6       Monitoring for Deficiency of Pituitary Hormones As the pharmacological activity of SIGNIFOR mimics that of somatostatin, inhibition of pituitary hormones, other than ACTH, may occur. Monitoring of pituitary function [e.g., thyroid-stimulating harmone (TSH)/free T 4 , GH/IGF-1] should occur prior to initiation of therapy with SIGNIFOR and periodically during treatment should be considered as clinically appropriate. Patients who have undergone transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation are particularly at increased risk for deficiency of pituitary hormones.",

A total of 162 Cushing's disease patients were exposed to SIGNIFOR in the Phase III study [see Clinical Studies (14)] . At study entry, patients were randomized to receive twice a day doses of either 0.6 mg or 0.9 mg of SIGNIFOR given subcutaneously. The mean age of patients was approximately 40 years old with a predominance of female patients (78%). The majority of the patients had persistent or recurrent Cushing's disease (83%) and few patients (≤ 5%) in either treatment group had received previous pituitary irradiation. The median exposure to the treatment was 10.4 months (0.03-37.8) with 68% of patients having at least 6-months exposure. In the Phase III trial, adverse reactions were reported in 98% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (frequency ≥ 20% in either group) were diarrhea, nausea, hyperglycemia, cholelithiasis, headache, abdominal pain, fatigue, and diabetes mellitus. There were no deaths during the study. Serious adverse events were reported in 25% of patients. Adverse events leading to study discontinuation were reported in 17% of patients. Adverse reactions with an overall frequency higher than 5% are presented in Table 1 by randomized dose group and overall. Adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions listed first.

Gastrointestinal Disorders Gastrointestinal disorders, predominantly diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were reported frequently in the Phase III trial (see Table 1). These events began to develop primarily during the first month of treatment with SIGNIFOR and required no intervention. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Hyperglycemia-related terms were reported frequently in the Phase III trial. For all patients, these terms included: hyperglycemia (40%), diabetes mellitus (18%), increased HbA1c (11%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (9%). In general, increases in FPG and HbA1c were seen soon after initiation of SIGNIFOR and were sustained during the treatment period. In the SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg group, mean FPG levels increased from 98.6 mg/dL at baseline to 125.1 mg/dL at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.9 mg group, mean fasting FPG levels increased from 97.0 mg/dL at baseline to 128.0 mg/dL at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.6 mg group, HbA1c increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.2% at Month 6. In the SIGNIFOR 0.9 mg group, HbA1c increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.3% at Month 6 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . At one-month follow-up visits, following discontinuation of SIGNIFOR, mean FPG and HbA1c levels decreased but remained above baseline values. Long-term follow-up data are not available. Elevated Liver Tests In the Phase III trial, there were transient mean elevations in aminotransferase values in patients treated with SIGNIFOR. Mean values returned to baseline levels by Month 4 of treatment. The elevations were not associated with clinical symptoms of hepatic disease. In the clinical development program of SIGNIFOR, there were 4 patients with concurrent elevations in ALT greater than 3 x ULN and bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN: one patient with Cushing's disease and 3 healthy volunteers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . In all 4 cases, the elevations were noted within the first 10 days of treatment. In all of these cases, total bilirubin elevations were seen either concomitantly or preceding the transaminase elevation. The patient with Cushing's disease developed jaundice. All 4 cases had resolution of the laboratory abnormalities with discontinuation of SIGNIFOR. Hypocortisolism Cases of hypocortisolism were reported in the Phase III study in Cushing's disease patients [see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Studies (14)] . The majority of cases were manageable by reducing the dose of SIGNIFOR and/or adding low-dose, short-term glucocorticoid therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Injection-Site Reactions Injection-site reactions were reported in 17% of patients enrolled in the Phase III trial in Cushing's disease. The events were most frequently reported as local pain, erythema, hematoma, hemorrhage, and pruritus. These events resolved spontaneously and required no intervention. Thyroid Function Hypothyroidism, with the use of SIGNIFOR, was reported for seven patients participating in the Phase III study in Cushing's disease. All seven patients presented with a TSH close to or below the lower limit at study entry, which precludes establishing a conclusive relationship between the adverse event and the use of SIGNIFOR. Other Abnormal Laboratory Findings Asymptomatic and reversible elevations in lipase and amylase were observed in patients receiving SIGNIFOR in clinical studies. Pancreatitis is a potential adverse reaction associated with the use of somatostatin analogs due to the association between cholelithiasis and acute pancreatitis. For hemoglobin levels, mean decreases that remained within normal range were observed. Also, post-baseline elevations in prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were noted in 33% and 47% of patients, respectively. The PT and PTT elevations were minimal. These laboratory findings are of unclear clinical significance. 6.2       Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of SIGNIFOR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cholelithiasis resulting in complications, including cholecystitis and cholangitis, which have sometimes required cholecystectomy"
