    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The use of doxycycline hyclate tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus during pregnancy. (2.2 , 5.1 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) The use of doxycycline hyclate tablets during the second and third-trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus during pregnancy. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.4 ) Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported. Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.3 ) Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Limit sun exposure. ( 5.4 ) Overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi, may occur. If such infections occur, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. ( 5.10 ) 5.1\tTooth Development The use of doxycycline hyclate tablets during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs of the tetracycline class, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported with drugs of the tetracycline class. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if doxycycline hyclate is used during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.4 )] Use doxycycline hyclate in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies. 5.2 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of doxycycline hyclate tablets during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if doxycycline hyclate is used during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.4 )] 5.3 Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline hyclate, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.4 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. 5.5\tSevere Skin Reactions Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with doxycycline and have been associated with worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption [see Adverse Reactions ( If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue doxycycline hyclate immediately and institute appropriate therapy. 6 )]. 5.6\tIntracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline hyclate. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline hyclate should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize. 5.7 Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function. 5.8  Incomplete Suppression of Malaria Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains. Doxycycline does not suppress P. falciparum’s sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas. 5.9 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing doxycycline hyclate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.10 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth Doxycycline hyclate may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If such infections occur, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. 5.11 Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials or post-approval use of tetracycline-class drugs, including doxycycline.

Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development [See Warnings and Precautions ( . Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed [see 5.1 )] Dosage and Administration ( )]. 2.1 Skin: Maculopapular and erythematous rashes, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, and erythema multiforme, and fixed drug eruption have been reported. Photosensitivity has been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. ) 5.4 Renal: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose-related [see Warnings and Precautions ( )]. 5. 7 Hypersensitivity reactions: Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reaction with eosinophiliaand systemic symptoms (DRESS). Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Intracranial Hypertension: Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions ( )]. 5.6 Thyroid Gland Changes: When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands. No abnormalities of thyroid function are known to occur. Psychiatric: Depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, insomnia, abnormal dreams, hallucination Adverse reactions observed in patients receiving tetracyclines include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, photosensitivity, urticaria, and hemolytic anemia.  ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. at 855-664-7744, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch ."
