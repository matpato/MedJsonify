The median duration of treatment was 6.5 months (range 0.2 – 28.7) for patients receiving CABOMETYX and 3.1 months (range 0.2 – 25.5) for patients receiving sunitinib. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Within 30 days of treatment, there were 4 deaths in patients treated with CABOMETYX and 6 deaths in patients treated with sunitinib. Of the 4 patients treated with CABOMETYX, 2 patients died due to gastrointestinal perforation, 1 patient had acute renal failure, and 1 patient died due to clinical deterioration. All Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were collected in the entire safety population. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (≥5%) in patients treated with CABOMETYX were hypertension, diarrhea, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, PPE, fatigue, increased ALT, decreased appetite, stomatitis, pain, hypotension, and syncope. The median average daily dose was 50.3 mg for CABOMETYX and 44.7 mg for sunitinib (excluding scheduled sunitinib non-dosing days). The dose was reduced in 46% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 35% of patients receiving sunitinib. The dose was held in 73% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and in 71% of patients receiving sunitinib. Based on patient disposition, 21% of patients receiving CABOMETYX and 22% of patients receiving sunitinib discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Table 8.
