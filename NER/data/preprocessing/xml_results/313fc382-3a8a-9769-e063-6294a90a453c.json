    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Oxybutynin chloride tablets are indicated for the relief of symptoms of bladder instability associated with voiding in patients with uninhibited neurogenic or reflex neurogenic bladder (i.e., urgency, frequency, urinary leakage, urge incontinence, dysuria).",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Oxybutynin chloride is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention and other severe decreased gastrointestinal motility conditions, uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma and in patients who are at risk for these conditions. Oxybutynin chloride is also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug substance or other components of the product.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue and/or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided.PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects (see ). A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. ADVERSE REACTIONS Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson's disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms. General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly, in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and in patients with myasthenia gravis. Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hiatal hernia, tachycardia, hypertension, myasthenia gravis, and prostatic hypertrophy. Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention (see ). CONTRAINDICATIONS Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease. Oxybutynin chloride, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, and intestinal atony. Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis. Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue, edema of the laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Patients should be informed that heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature. Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness (somnolence), or blurred vision, patients should be advised to exercise caution. Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide. Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride was administered with ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, such as antimycotic agents (e.g., itraconazole and miconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., C max and AUC). The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known. Caution should be used when such drugs are coadministered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 24-month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. These doses are approximately 6, 25, and 50 times the maximum human exposure, based on surface area. Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems. Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility. Pregnancy Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster, rabbit, rat, and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus. The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established. Therefore, oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless, in the judgment of the physician, the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older (see ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24-week, open-label trial. Patients were aged 5 to 15 years, all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition (e.g., spina bifida), all used clean intermittent catheterization, and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride. Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters. At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg, treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL, an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL, and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43% to 61%. Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results. Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL, a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O, and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions (of at least 15 cm H 2 O) from 39% to 20%. As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5, oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients; however, a lower initial starting dose of 2.5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half-life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours. 2,3,4 In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",
