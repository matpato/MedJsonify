  "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Tolterodine tartrate tablets are indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency.",
  "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Tolterodine tartrate tablets are contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, gastric retention, or uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma. Tolterodine tartrate tablets are also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients, or to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets which, like tolterodine tartrate tablets, are metabolized to 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine.",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Anaphylaxis and angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment have occurred with the first or subsequent doses of tolterodine tartrate tablets. In the event of difficulty in breathing, upper airway obstruction, or fall in blood pressure, tolterodine tartrate tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided.PRECAUTIONS General Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention ( see ) . CONTRAINDICATIONS Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Tolterodine tartrate tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility. Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Effects Tolterodine tartrate tablets is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system ( CNS ) effects including dizziness and somnolence ( see ) . Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug’s effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. ADVERSE REACTIONS Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate tablets is 1 mg twice daily ( see ) . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Myasthenia Gravis Tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval ( see ) , the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day ( two times the therapeutic dose ) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2 D6 poor metabolizers ( PM ) than extensive metabolizers ( EMs ) . The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe tolterodine tartrate tablets for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA ( e.g. , quinidine, procainamide ) or Class III ( e.g. , amiodarone, sotalol ) antiarrhythmic medications ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Cardiac Electrophysiology ) . There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with tolterodine tartrate tablets or tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules. PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions Information for Patients Patients should be informed that antimuscarinic agents such as tolterodine tartrate tablets may produce the following effects: blurred vision, dizziness, or drowsiness. Patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug's effects have been determined. Drug Interactions CYP3 A4 Inhibitors Ketoconazole, an inhibitor of the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3 A4, significantly increased plasma concentrations of tolterodine when coadministered to subjects who were poor metabolizers ( see , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Variability in Metabolism and ) . For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3 A4 inhibitors such as other azole antifungals ( e.g. , itraconazole, miconazole ) or macrolide antibiotics ( e.g. , erythromycin, clarithromycin ) or cyclosporine or vinblastine, the recommended dose of tolterodine tartrate tablets is 1 mg twice daily ( see Drug-Drug Interactions ) . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Drug-Laboratory-Test Interactions Interactions between tolterodine and laboratory tests have not been studied. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with tolterodine were conducted in mice and rats. At the maximum tolerated dose in mice ( 30 mg/kg/day ) , female rats ( 20 mg/kg/day ) , and male rats ( 30 mg/kg/day ) , AUC values obtained for tolterodine were 355, 291, and 462 µg·h/L, respectively. In comparison, the human AUC value for a 2 mg dose administered twice daily is estimated at 34 µg·h/L. Thus, tolterodine exposure in the carcinogenicity studies was 9- to 14-fold higher than expected in humans. No increase in tumors was found in either mice or rats. No mutagenic effects of tolterodine were detected in a battery of in vitro tests, including bacterial mutation assays ( Ames test ) in 4 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in 2 strains of Escherichia coli , a gene mutation assay in L5178 Y mouse lymphoma cells, and chromosomal aberration tests in human lymphocytes. Tolterodine was also negative in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test in the mouse. In female mice treated for 2 weeks before mating and during gestation with 20 mg/kg/day ( corresponding to AUC value of about 500 µg·h/L ) , neither effects on reproductive performance or fertility were seen. Based on AUC values, the systemic exposure was about 15-fold higher in animals than in humans. In male mice, a dose of 30 mg/kg/day did not induce any adverse effects on fertility. Pregnancy Tolterodine, administered at oral doses of 20 mg/kg/day ( approximately 14 times the human exposure ) , showed no anomalies or malformations in mice. When given at doses of 30 to 40 mg/kg/day, tolterodine has been shown to be embryolethal, reduce fetal weight, and increase the incidence of fetal abnormalities ( cleft palate, digital abnormalities, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and various skeletal abnormalities, primarily reduced ossification ) in mice. At these doses, the AUC values were about 20- to 25-fold higher than in humans. Rabbits treated subcutaneously at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day achieved an AUC of 100 µg·h/L, which is about 3-fold higher than that resulting from the human dose. This dose did not result in any embryotoxicity or teratogenicity. There are no studies of tolterodine in pregnant women. Therefore, tolterodine tartrate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Tolterodine is excreted into the milk in mice. Offspring of female mice treated with tolterodine 20 mg/kg/day during the lactation period had slightly reduced body weight gain. The offspring regained the weight during the maturation phase. It is not known whether tolterodine is excreted in human milk; therefore, tolterodine tartrate tablets should not be administered during nursing. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue tolterodine tartrate tablets in nursing mothers. Pediatric Use Efficacy in the pediatric population has not been demonstrated. Two pediatric phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies were conducted using tolterodine extended release capsules. A total of 710 pediatric patients ( 486 on tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules and 224 on placebo ) aged 5–10 years with urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence were studied. The percentage of patients with urinary tract infections was higher in patients treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules ( 6.6% ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 4.5% ) . Aggressive, abnormal, and hyperactive behavior and attention disorders occurred in 2.9% of children treated with tolterodine tartrate extended-release capsules compared to 0.9% of children treated with placebo. Geriatric Use Of the 1120 patients who were treated in the four Phase 3, 12-week clinical studies of tolterodine tartrate tablets, 474 ( 42% ) were 65 to 91 years of age. No overall differences in safety were observed between the older and younger patients ( see ) . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations",
  "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial program for tolterodine tartrate tablets included 3071 patients who were treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets ( N=2133 ) or placebo ( N=938 ) . The patients were treated with 1, 2, 4, or 8 mg/day for up to 12 months. No differences in the safety profile of tolterodine were identified based on age, gender, race, or metabolism. The data described below reflect exposure to tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in 986 patients and to placebo in 683 patients exposed for 12 weeks in five Phase 3, controlled clinical studies. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and approximating rates. Sixty-six percent of patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported adverse events versus 56% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events reported by patients receiving tolterodine tartrate tablets were dry mouth, headache, constipation, vertigo/dizziness, and abdominal pain. Dry mouth, constipation, abnormal vision ( accommodation abnormalities ) , urinary retention, and xerophthalmia are expected side effects of antimuscarinic agents. Dry mouth was the most frequently reported adverse event for patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the Phase 3 clinical studies, occurring in 34.8% of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets and 9.8% of placebo-treated patients. One percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets discontinued treatment due to dry mouth. The frequency of discontinuation due to adverse events was highest during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Seven percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid discontinued treatment due to adverse events versus 6% of placebo patients. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of tolterodine tartrate tablets were dizziness and headache. Three percent of patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid reported a serious adverse event versus 4% of placebo patients. Significant ECG changes in QT and QTc have not been demonstrated in clinical-study patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid. Table 5 lists the adverse events reported in 1% or more of the patients treated with tolterodine tartrate tablets 2 mg bid in the 12-week studies. The adverse events are reported regardless of causality. Table 5. Incidence in nearest integer.

Central/Peripheral Nervous: Reports of aggravation of symptoms of dementia ( e.g. , confusion, disorientation, delusion ) have been reported after tolterodine therapy was initiated in patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of dementia. Because these spontaneously reported events are from the worldwide post-marketing experience, the frequency of events and the role of tolterodine in their causation cannot be reliably determined."
