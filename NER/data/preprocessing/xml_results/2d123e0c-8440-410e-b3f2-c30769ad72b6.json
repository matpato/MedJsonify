  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Vasopressin injection is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with vasodilatory shock who remain hypotensive despite fluids and catecholamines. • Vasopressin injection is indicated to increase blood pressure in adults with vasodilatory shock who remain hypotensive despite fluids and catecholamines. ( 1 )",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Vasopressin injection 1 mL single dose vial does not contain chlorobutanol and is therefore contraindicated only in patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to 8-L-arginine vasopressin. • Vasopressin injection 1 mL single dose vial does not contain chlorobutanol and is therefore contraindicated only in patients with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to 8-L-arginine vasopressin. ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Can worsen cardiac function. ( 5.1 ) • Reversible diabetes insipidus ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Worsening Cardiac Function A decrease in cardiac index may be observed with the use of vasopressin. 5.2 Reversible Diabetes Insipidus Patients may experience reversible diabetes insipidus, manifested by the development of polyuria, a dilute urine, and hypernatremia, after cessation of treatment with vasopressin. Monitor serum electrolytes, fluid status and urine output after vasopressin discontinuation. Some patients may require readministration of vasopressin or administration of desmopressin to correct fluid and electrolyte shifts.",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of vasopressin were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bleeding/lymphatic system disorders: Hemorrhagic shock, decreased platelets, intractable bleeding Cardiac disorders: Right heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, myocardial ischemia Gastrointestinal disorders: Mesenteric ischemia Hepatobiliary: Increased bilirubin levels Renal/urinary disorders: Acute renal insufficiency Vascular disorders: Distal limb ischemia Metabolic: Hyponatremia Skin: Ischemic lesions Postmarketing Experience Reversible diabetes insipidus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . The most common adverse reactions include decreased cardiac output, bradycardia, tachyarrhythmias, hyponatremia and ischemia ( coronary, mesenteric, skin, digital ) .
