    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions (including some life-threatening and rare fatal reactions) can occur early in the first infusion of TORISEL. Patients should be monitored throughout the infusion. ( 5.1 ) • To treat hypersensitivity reactions, stop TORISEL and treat with an antihistamine. TORISEL may be restarted at physician discretion at a slower rate. ( 5.1 ) • Hepatic Impairment: Use caution when treating patients with mild hepatic impairment and reduce dose. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) • Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are likely and may require treatment. Monitor glucose and lipid profiles. ( 5.3 , 5.6 ) • Infections may result from immunosuppression. ( 5.4 ) • Monitor for symptoms or radiographic changes of interstitial lung disease (ILD). If ILD is suspected, discontinue TORISEL, and consider use of corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. ( 5.5 ) • Bowel perforation may occur. Evaluate fever, abdominal pain, bloody stools, and/or acute abdomen promptly. ( 5.7 ) • Renal failure, sometimes fatal, has occurred. Monitor renal function at baseline and while on TORISEL. ( 5.8 ) • Due to abnormal wound healing, use TORISEL with caution in the perioperative period. ( 5.9 ) • Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome may occur. Monitor urine protein prior to the start of TORISEL therapy and periodically thereafter. Discontinue TORISEL in patients with who develop nephrotic syndrome. ( 5.11 ) • Live vaccinations and close contact with those who received live vaccines should be avoided. ( 5.14 ) • Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential hazard to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.15 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) • Elderly patients may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions, including diarrhea, edema and pneumonia. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions, including but not limited to flushing, chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, apnea, loss of consciousness, hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, have been associated with the administration of temsirolimus. These reactions can occur very early in the first infusion, but may also occur with subsequent infusions. Patients should be monitored throughout the infusion and appropriate supportive care should be available. Temsirolimus infusion should be interrupted in all patients with severe infusion reactions and appropriate medical therapy administered. TORISEL should be used with caution in persons with known hypersensitivity to temsirolimus or its metabolites (including sirolimus), polysorbate 80, or to any other component (including the excipients) of TORISEL. An H 1 antihistamine should be administered to patients before the start of the intravenous temsirolimus infusion. TORISEL should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to an antihistamine, or patients who cannot receive an antihistamine for other medical reasons. If a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction during the TORISEL infusion, the infusion should be stopped and the patient should be observed for at least 30 to 60 minutes (depending on the severity of the reaction). At the discretion of the physician, treatment may be resumed with the administration of an H 1 -receptor antagonist (such as diphenhydramine), if not previously administered [see , and/or an H Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 2 -receptor antagonist (such as intravenous famotidine 20 mg or intravenous ranitidine 50 mg) approximately 30 minutes before restarting the TORISEL infusion. The infusion may then be resumed at a slower rate (up to 60 minutes). A benefit-risk assessment should be done prior to the continuation of temsirolimus therapy in patients with severe or life-threatening reactions. 5.2 Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of TORISEL were evaluated in a dose escalation phase 1 study in 110 patients with normal or varying degrees of hepatic impairment. Patients with baseline bilirubin >1.5×ULN experienced greater toxicity than patients with baseline bilirubin ≤1.5×ULN when treated with TORISEL. The overall frequency of ≥ grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths, including deaths due to progressive disease, were greater in patients with baseline bilirubin >1.5×ULN due to increased risk of death [see . Contraindications (4) ] Use caution when treating patients with mild hepatic impairment. Concentrations of temsirolimus and its metabolite sirolimus were increased in patients with elevated AST or bilirubin levels. If TORISEL must be given in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin >1 – 1.5×ULN or AST >ULN but bilirubin ≤ULN), reduce the dose of TORISEL to 15 mg/week [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] 5.3 Hyperglycemia/Glucose Intolerance The use of TORISEL is likely to result in increases in serum glucose. In the phase 3 trial, 89% of patients receiving TORISEL had at least one elevated serum glucose while on treatment, and 26% of patients reported hyperglycemia as an adverse event. This may result in the need for an increase in the dose of, or initiation of, insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agent therapy. Serum glucose should be tested before and during treatment with TORISEL. Patients should be advised to report excessive thirst or any increase in the volume or frequency of urination. 5.4 Infections The use of TORISEL may result in immunosuppression. Patients should be carefully observed for the occurrence of infections, including opportunistic infections [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), including fatalities, has been reported in patients who received temsirolimus. This may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Prophylaxis of PJP should be considered when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required. 5.5 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease, some resulting in death, occurred in patients who received TORISEL. Some patients were asymptomatic, or had minimal symptoms, with infiltrates detected on computed tomography scan or chest radiograph. Others presented with symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and fever. Some patients required discontinuation of TORISEL and/or treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics, while some patients continued treatment without additional intervention. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms. It is recommended that patients undergo baseline radiographic assessment by lung computed tomography scan or chest radiograph prior to the initiation of TORISEL therapy. Follow such assessments periodically, even in the absence of clinical respiratory symptoms. It is recommended that patients be followed closely for occurrence of clinical respiratory symptoms. If clinically significant respiratory symptoms develop, consider withholding TORISEL administration until after recovery of symptoms and improvement of radiographic findings related to pneumonitis. Empiric treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics may be considered. Opportunistic infections such as PJP should be considered in the differential diagnosis. For patients who require use of corticosteroids, prophylaxis of PJP may be considered. 5.6 Hyperlipidemia The use of TORISEL is likely to result in increases in serum triglycerides and cholesterol. In the phase 3 trial, 87% of patients receiving TORISEL had at least one elevated serum cholesterol value and 83% had at least one elevated serum triglyceride value. This may require initiation, or increase in the dose, of lipid-lowering agents. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides should be tested before and during treatment with TORISEL. 5.7 Bowel Perforation Cases of fatal bowel perforation occurred in patients who received TORISEL. These patients presented with fever, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, bloody stools, diarrhea, and/or acute abdomen. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening abdominal pain or blood in their stools. 5.8 Renal Failure Cases of rapidly progressive and sometimes fatal acute renal failure not clearly related to disease progression occurred in patients who received TORISEL. Some of these cases were not responsive to dialysis. 5.9 Wound Healing Complications Use of TORISEL has been associated with abnormal wound healing. Therefore, caution should be exercised with the use of TORISEL in the perioperative period. 5.10 Intracerebral Hemorrhage Patients with central nervous system tumors (primary CNS tumor or metastases) and/or receiving anticoagulation therapy may be at an increased risk of developing intracerebral bleeding (including fatal outcomes) while receiving TORISEL. 5.11 Proteinuria and Nephrotic syndrome Proteinuria (including cases of nephrotic syndrome) has occurred in patients treated with TORISEL. Monitor urine protein prior to the start of TORISEL therapy and periodically thereafter. Discontinue TORISEL in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. 5.12 Co-administration with Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A Metabolism Agents Inducing CYP3A Metabolism: Strong inducers of CYP3A4/5 such as dexamethasone, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin, and rifampacin may decrease exposure of the active metabolite, sirolimus. If alternative treatment cannot be administered, a dose adjustment should be considered. St. John's Wort may decrease TORISEL plasma concentrations unpredictably. Patients receiving TORISEL should not take St. John's Wort concomitantly [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Agents Inhibiting CYP3A Metabolism: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin may increase blood concentrations of the active metabolite sirolimus. If alternative treatments cannot be administered, a dose adjustment should be considered [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 5.13 Concomitant use of TORISEL with sunitinib The combination of TORISEL and sunitinib resulted in dose-limiting toxicity. Dose-limiting toxicities (Grade 3/4 erythematous maculopapular rash, and gout/cellulitis requiring hospitalization) were observed in two out of three patients treated in the first cohort of a phase 1 study at doses of TORISEL 15 mg IV per week and sunitinib 25 mg oral per day (Days 1–28 followed by a 2-week rest). 5.14 Vaccinations The use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with TORISEL. Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 5.15 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action, TORISEL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, daily oral administration of temsirolimus to pregnant animals during organogenesis caused adverse embryo-fetal effects in rats and rabbits at approximately 0.04 and 0.12 times the AUC in patients at the recommended human dose, respectively. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TORISEL and for 3 months after the last dose.

    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions have been associated with TORISEL in clinical trials and are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label [see . Warnings and Precautions (5) ] • Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] • Hyperglycemia/Glucose Intolerance [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] • Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] • Interstitial Lung Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] • Hyperlipidemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] • Bowel Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] • Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] • Wound Healing Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] • Intracerebral Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] The most common (≥30%) adverse reactions observed with TORISEL are rash, asthenia, mucositis, nausea, edema, and anorexia. The most common (≥30%) laboratory abnormalities observed with TORISEL are anemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated serum creatinine, hypophosphatemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated AST, and leukopenia. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥30%) are rash, asthenia, mucositis, nausea, edema, and anorexia. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence ≥30%) are anemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated serum creatinine, lymphopenia, hypophosphatemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated AST, and leukopenia.

In the phase 3 randomized, open-label study of interferon alfa (IFN-α) alone, TORISEL alone, and TORISEL and IFN-α, a total of 616 patients were treated. Two hundred patients received IFN-α weekly, 208 received TORISEL 25 mg weekly, and 208 patients received a combination of TORISEL and IFN-α weekly [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] Treatment with the combination of TORISEL 15 mg and IFN-α was associated with an increased incidence of multiple adverse reactions and did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with IFN-α alone. Table 1 shows the percentage of patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse reactions. Reactions reported in at least 10% of patients who received TORISEL 25 mg alone or IFN-α alone are listed. Table 2 shows the percentage of patients experiencing selected laboratory abnormalities. Data for the same adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in the IFN-α alone arm are shown for comparison : Table 1 – Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 10% of Patients Who Received 25 mg IV TORISEL or IFN-α in the Randomized Trial Adverse Reaction TORISEL 25 mg n = 208 IFN-α n = 200 All Grades Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0. n (%) Grades 3&4 n (%) All Grades n (%) Grades 3&4 n (%) General disorders Asthenia 106 (51) 23 (11) 127 (64) 52 (26) Edema Includes edema, facial edema, and peripheral edema 73 (35) 7 (3) 21 (11) 1 (1) Pain 59 (28) 10 (5) 31 (16) 4 (2) Pyrexia 50 (24) 1 (1) 99 (50) 7 (4) Weight Loss 39 (19) 3 (1) 50 (25) 4 (2) Headache 31 (15) 1 (1) 30 (15) 0 (0) Chest Pain 34 (16) 2 (1) 18 (9) 2 (1) Chills 17 (8) 1 (1) 59 (30) 3 (2) Gastrointestinal disorders Mucositis Includes aphthous stomatitis, glossitis, mouth ulceration, mucositis, and stomatitis 86 (41) 6 (3) 19 (10) 0 (0) Anorexia 66 (32) 6 (3) 87 (44) 8 (4) Nausea 77 (37) 5 (2) 82 (41) 9 (5) Diarrhea 56 (27) 3 (1) 40 (20) 4 (2) Abdominal Pain 44 (21) 9 (4) 34 (17) 3 (2) Constipation 42 (20) 0 (0) 36 (18) 1 (1) Vomiting 40 (19) 4 (2) 57 (29) 5 (3) Infections Infections Includes infections not otherwise specified (NOS) and the following infections that occurred infrequently as distinct entities: abscess, bronchitis, cellulitis, herpes simplex, and herpes zoster 42 (20) 6 (3) 19 (10) 4 (2) Urinary tract infection Includes cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, and urinary tract infection 31 (15) 3 (1) 24 (12) 3 (2) Pharyngitis 25 (12) 0 (0) 3 (2) 0 (0) Rhinitis 20 (10) 0 (0) 4 (2) 0 (0) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back Pain 41 (20) 6 (3) 28 (14) 7 (4) Arthralgia 37 (18) 2 (1) 29 (15) 2 (1) Myalgia 16 (8) 1 (1) 29 (15) 2 (1) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnea 58 (28) 18 (9) 48 (24) 11 (6) Cough 53 (26) 2 (1) 29 (15) 0 (0) Epistaxis 25 (12) 0 (0) 7 (4) 0 (0) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash Includes eczema, exfoliative dermatitis, maculopapular rash, pruritic rash, pustular rash, rash (NOS), and vesiculobullous rash 97 (47) 10 (5) 14 (7) 0 (0) Pruritus 40 (19) 1 (1) 16 (8) 0 (0) Nail Disorder 28 (14) 0 (0) 1 (1) 0 (0) Dry Skin 22 (11) 1 (1) 14 (7) 0 (0) Acne 21 (10) 0 (0) 2 (1) 0 (0) Nervous system disorders Dysgeusia Includes taste loss and taste perversion 41 (20) 0 (0) 17 (9) 0 (0) Insomnia 24 (12) 1 (1) 30 (15) 0 (0) Depression 9 (4) 0 (0) 27 (14) 4 (2) The following selected adverse reactions were reported less frequently (<10%).

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to readily estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving temsirolimus: angioedema, rhabdomyolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy), pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and cholelithiasis. There are also post-marketing reports of temsirolimus extravasations resulting in swelling, pain, warmth, and erythema."
