    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to sodium ferric gluconate or any of its components. Reactions have included anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.1 ) Known hypersensitivity to sodium ferric gluconate or any of its inactive components. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of the infusion. Only administer sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions. ( 5.1 ) Hypotension: Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection may cause hypotension. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypotension during and following each sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection dose. ( 5.2 ) Iron Overload: Regularly monitor hematologic responses during sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection therapy. Do not administer sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection to patients with iron overload. ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Premature and low-birth-weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have been life-threatening and fatal, have been reported in patients receiving sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection in postmarketing experience. Patients may present with shock, clinically significant hypotension, loss of consciousness, or collapse. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of the infusion. Only administer sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ]. In the single-dose, postmarketing safety study one patient experienced a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction (diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, severe lower back pain, dyspnea, and wheezing for 20 minutes) following sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration. Among 1,097 patients who received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection in this study, there were 9 patients (0.8%) who had an adverse reaction that, in the view of the investigator, precluded further sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration. These included one life-threatening reaction, six allergic reactions (including pruritus, facial flushing, chills, dyspnea/chest pain, and rash), and two other reactions (hypotension and nausea). Another 2 patients experienced (0.2%) allergic reactions not deemed to represent drug intolerance (nausea/malaise and nausea/dizziness) following sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration. 5.2 Hypotension Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection may cause clinically significant hypotension. Hypotension associated with lightheadedness, malaise, fatigue, weakness or severe pain in the chest, back, flanks, or groin has been reported. These hypotensive reactions may or may not be associated with signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and usually resolve within one to two hours. In the single-dose safety study, postadministration hypotensive events were observed in 22/1,097 patients (2%) following sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration. Transient hypotension may occur during dialysis. Administration of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection may augment hypotension caused by dialysis. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypotension during and following sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. 5.3 Iron Overload Excessive therapy with parenteral iron can lead to excess storage of iron with the possibility of iatrogenic hemosiderosis. Patients receiving sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection require periodic monitoring of hematologic and iron parameters (hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation). 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \"gasping syndrome\" can occur in neonates and low-birth-weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection. The \"gasping syndrome\" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (Sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection contains 9 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) [see Use in Specific Populations ( ]. 8.4 )",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥10%) in adult patients were nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea, injection site reaction, hypotension, cramps, hypertension, dizziness, dyspnea, chest pain, leg cramps, and pain. In patients 6 to 15 years of age the most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were hypotension, headache, hypertension, tachycardia and vomiting.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions (≥10%) in adult patients were nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea, injection site reaction, hypotension, cramps, hypertension, dizziness, abnormal erythrocytes (e.g., changes in morphology, color, or number of red blood cells), dyspnea, chest pain, leg cramps and pain. In patients 6 to 15 years of age the most common adverse reactions (≥10%) were hypotension, headache, hypertension, tachycardia and vomiting. Studies A and B In multiple dose Studies A and B (total 126 adult patients), the most frequent treatment emergent adverse reactions following sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection were: Body as a Whole: injection site reaction (33%), chest pain (10%), pain (10%), asthenia (7%), headache (7%), fatigue (6%), fever (5%), malaise, infection, abscess, chills, rigors, carcinoma, flu-like syndrome, sepsis, lightheadedness, weakness. Nervous System: cramps (25%), dizziness (13%), paresthesias (6%), agitation, somnolence, decreased level of consciousness.

Cardiovascular System: hypotension (29%), hypertension (13%), syncope (6%), tachycardia (5%), bradycardia, vasodilatation, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema. Gastrointestinal System: nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea (35%), anorexia, abdominal pain (6%), rectal disorder, dyspepsia, eructation, flatulence, gastrointestinal disorder, melena. Musculoskeletal System: leg cramps (10%), myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, arm pain. Skin and Appendages: pruritus (6%), rash, increased sweating. Genitourinary System: urinary tract infection, and menorrhagia. Special Senses: conjunctivitis, rolling of the eyes, watery eyes, puffy eye lids, arcus senilis, redness of the eye, diplopia, and deafness. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hyperkalemia (6%), generalized edema (5%), leg edema, peripheral edema, hypoglycemia, edema, hypervolemia, hypokalemia. Hematologic System: abnormal erythrocytes (11%) (changes in morphology, color, or number of red blood cells), anemia, leukocytosis, lymphadenopathy. Study C – Pediatric Pediatric Patients: In a clinical trial of 66 iron-deficient pediatric hemodialysis patients, 6 to 15 years of age, inclusive, who were receiving a stable erythropoietin dosing regimen, the most common adverse reactions, occurring in ≥5%, regardless of treatment dosage, were: hypotension (35%), headache (24%), hypertension (23%), tachycardia (17%), vomiting (11%), fever (9%), nausea (9%), abdominal pain (9%), pharyngitis (9%), diarrhea (8%), infection (8%), rhinitis (6%), and thrombosis (6%). More patients in the higher dose group (3.0 mg/kg) than in the lower dose group (1.5 mg/kg) experienced the following adverse events: hypotension (41% vs. 28%), tachycardia (21% vs. 13%), fever (15% vs. 3%), headache (29% vs. 19%), abdominal pain (15% vs. 3%), nausea (12% vs. 6%), vomiting (12% vs. 9%), pharyngitis (12% vs. 6%), and rhinitis (9% vs. 3%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In the single-dose, postmarketing, safety study, 11% of patients who received sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection and 9.4% of patients who received placebo reported adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions following sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration were: hypotension (2%), nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea (2%), pain (0.7%), hypertension (0.6%), allergic reaction (0.5%), chest pain (0.5%), pruritus (0.5%), and back pain (0.4%). The following additional events were reported in two or more patients: hypertonia, nervousness, dry mouth, and hemorrhage. In the multiple-dose, open-label surveillance study, 28% of the patients received concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy. The incidences of both drug intolerance and suspected allergic events following first dose sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection administration were 1.6% in patients with concomitant ACEI use compared to 0.7% in patients without concomitant ACEI use. The patient with a life-threatening event was not on ACEI therapy. One patient had facial flushing immediately on sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection exposure. No hypotension occurred and the event resolved rapidly and spontaneously without intervention other than drug withdrawal. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified with the use of sodium ferric gluconate complex in sucrose injection from postmarketing spontaneous reports: Cardiovascular System: shock, fetal bradycardia, injection site superficial thrombophlebitis, phlebitis, acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction or with in-stent thrombosis in the context of a hypersensitivity reaction. Gastrointestinal System: dysgeusia. Immune System: anaphylactic-type reactions. Nervous System: loss of consciousness, generalized convulsion, hypoesthesia. Skin and Appendages: skin discoloration, pallor. Individual doses exceeding 125 mg may be associated with a higher incidence and/or severity of adverse events based on information from postmarketing spontaneous reports. These adverse events included hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspnea, urticaria, chest pain, paresthesia, and peripheral swelling."
