  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE LUTRATE DEPOT 22.5 mg for 3-month administration ( leuprolide acetate ) is indicated for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. LUTRATE DEPOT is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist indicated for: Treatment of advanced prostate cancer. ( 1 )",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS LUTRATE DEPOT is contraindicated in: Hypersensitivity LUTRATE DEPOT is contraindicated in individuals with known hypersensitivity to GnRH agonists or any of the excipients in LUTRATE DEPOT. Reports of anaphylactic reactions to GnRH agonists have been reported in the medical literature. Hypersensitivity to GnRH, GnRH agonist or any of the excipients in LUTRATE DEPOT. ( 4 ) .",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tumor Flare: Increased serum testosterone ( ~50% above baseline ) during first week of treatment; monitor serum testosterone and PSA. ( 5.7 ) Transient worsening of symptoms, or additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer during the first few weeks of treatment. ( 5.1 ) Patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain which can be managed symptomatically. ( 5.1 ) Ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been reported with GnRH agonists, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. ( 5.1 ) Metabolic Syndrome: The use of GnRH agonists may lead to an increased risk of metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Monitor for signs and symptoms of metabolic syndrome including lipids, blood glucose level and/or HbA1 c and manage according to current treatment guidelines. ( 5.2 ) Cardiovascular Diseases: Increased risk of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH analogs in men. Monitor for cardiovascular disease and manage according to current clinical practice. ( 5.3 ) Effect on QT/QTc Interval: Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong QT interval. Consider risks and benefits. ( 5.4 ) Convulsions have been observed in patients with or without a history of predisposing factors. Manage convulsions according to the current clinical practice. ( 5.5 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions ( SCARs ) , including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ( SJS/TEN ) , may occur in patients treated with LUTRATE DEPOT. Interrupt LUTRATE DEPOT if signs or symptoms of SCARs develop. Permanently discontinue if SCARs are confirmed. ( 5.6 ) Monitor serum levels of testosterone following injection of LUTRATE DEPOT 22.5 mg for 3-month administration. ( 5.7 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: LUTRATE DEPOT may cause fetal harm. ( 5.8 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Tumor Flare Initially, LUTRATE DEPOT, like other GnRH agonists, causes increases in serum levels of testosterone to approximately 50% above baseline during the first weeks of treatment. Ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed, which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications. Transient worsening of symptoms may develop. Patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain, which can be managed symptomatically. Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and/or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy. 5.2 Metabolic Syndrome The use of GnRH agonists may lead to metabolic changes such as hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including cirrhosis, occurred in the post-marketing setting. Hyperglycemia may represent new-onset diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with pre-existing diabetes. Monitor for changes in serum lipids, blood glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1 c ) in patients receiving a GnRH agonist, and manage according to current treatment guidelines. 5.3 Cardiovascular Diseases Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men. The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios, and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice. 5.4 Effect on QT/QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, frequent electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. 5.5 Convulsions Postmarketing reports of convulsions have been observed in patients on leuprolide acetate therapy. These included patients with a history of seizures, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disorders, central nervous system anomalies or tumors, and in patients on concomitant medications that have been associated with convulsions such as bupropion and SSRIs. Convulsions have also been reported in patients in the absence of any of the conditions mentioned above. Patients receiving a GnRH agonist who experience convulsion should be managed according to current clinical practice. 5.6 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCARs ) , including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ( SJS/TEN ) , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) , may occur in patients receiving LUTRATE DEPOT; including cases with visceral involvement and/or requiring skin grafts [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of SCARs ( e.g. , a prodrome of fever, flu-like symptoms, mucosal lesions, progressive skin rash, or lymphadenopathy ) . If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt LUTRATE DEPOT until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue LUTRATE DEPOT. 5.7 Laboratory Tests Monitor serum levels of testosterone following injection of LUTRATE DEPOT 22.5 mg for 3-month administration. In the majority of patients, testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week, and then declined thereafter to castrate levels ( < 50 ng/dL ) within four weeks. [ see . Clinical Studies ( 14 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies, LUTRATE DEPOT may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies, administration of the monthly formulation of leuprolide acetate on day 6 of pregnancy ( sustained exposure was expected throughout the period of organogenesis ) caused adverse embryo-fetal toxicity in animals at doses less than the human dose, based on body surface area, using an estimated daily dose. Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] .",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following is discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Tumor Flare [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Metabolic Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Cardiovascular Disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Effect on QT/QTc Interval [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Convulsions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 10% ) are hot flushes, upper respiratory infection, fatigue, diarrhea, pollakiuria, arthralgia, and injection site pain ( 6 ) . As with other GnRH agonist, other adverse reactions, including decreased bone density and rare cases of pituitary apoplexy may occur.

LUTRATE DEPOT 22.5 mg for 3-Month Administration In a clinical trial of LUTRATE DEPOT 22.5 mg for 3-month administration, patients were treated for 24 weeks with 157/163 receiving two injections. The table includes adverse reactions were reported in 5% or more of the patients during the treatment period as well as the incidence of these adverse reaction that were considered, by the treating physician, to be at least possibly related to LUTRATE DEPOT. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions reported as treatment-emergent in 13% of patients and treatment-related 4% of patients. CTCAE v.3 1 Includes cold sweat, flushing, hot flush, hyperhidrosis, and night sweats 2 Includes influenza, influenza-like illness, nasal congestion, nasopharyngitis, rhinorrhea, upper respiratory tract infection and congestion Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 5% of Patients LUTRATE DEPOT 22.5 mg for 3-Month Administration N = 163 ( % ) Grade 1-4 Treatment-Emergent Treatment-Related Hot Flush/Flushing 1 128 ( 79 ) 127 ( 78 ) Upper Respiratory Infection 2 28 ( 17 ) 0 Fatigue/Asthenia 24 ( 15 ) 22 ( 13 ) Diarrhea 21 ( 13 ) 2 ( 1 ) Pollakiuria 20 ( 12 ) 3 ( 2 ) Arthralgia/Arthritis 18 ( 11 ) 2 ( 1 ) Injection Site Pain/Discomfort 18 ( 11 ) 15 ( 9 ) Constipation 15 ( 9 ) 1 ( 0.6 ) Extremity Pain 14 ( 9 ) 0 Nausea 14 ( 9 ) 4 ( 2 ) Nocturia 14 ( 9 ) 3 ( 2 ) Abdominal Pain/Discomfort 13 ( 8 ) 1 ( 0.6 ) Urinary Tract Pain 13 ( 8 ) 2 ( 1 ) Dizziness 12 ( 7 ) 2 ( 1 ) Headache/Sinus Headache 12 ( 7 ) 1 ( 0.6 ) Urinary Tract Infection 12 ( 7 ) 0 Bone Pain 11 ( 7 ) 4 ( 2 ) Back Pain 10 ( 6 ) 1 ( 0.6 ) Hypertension/Blood Pressure Increased 10 ( 6 ) 0 Pruritus/Generalized Pruritus 9 ( 6 ) 3 ( 2 ) In the same study, erectile dysfunction and testicular atrophy were reported in patients on LUTRATE DEPOT 22.5 mg. Laboratory abnormalities During the treatment period, at least a one grade change in laboratory values was seen ( >10% ) in the following: anemia, increased triglyceride, hyperglycemia, increased cholesterol, increased creatine kinase, leukopenia, increased AST, increased creatinine, and increased ALT. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Mood swings, including depression, have been reported. There have been very rare reports of suicidal ideation and attempt. Many, but not all, of these patients had a history of depression or other psychiatric illness. Patients should be counseled on the possibility of development or worsening of depression during treatment with LUTRATE DEPOT. Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely ( incidence rate of about 0.002% ) reported. Rash, urticaria, and photosensitivity reactions have also been reported. Pituitary apoplexy: During postmarketing surveillance, rare cases of pituitary apoplexy ( a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland ) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. In a majority of these cases, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose, and some within the first hour. In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse. Immediate medical attention has been required. Localized reactions including induration and abscess have been reported at the site of injection. Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia ( e.g. , joint and muscle pain, headaches, sleep disorders, gastrointestinal distress, and shortness of breath ) have been reported individually and collectively. Changes in Bone Density: Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with a GnRH agonist analog. In a clinical trial, 25 men with prostate cancer, 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months, underwent bone density studies as a result of pain. The leuprolide acetate-treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group. It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density. Immune Disorders: Anaphylaxis Psychiatric Disorders: Depression Cardiovascular System - hypotension, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorder - Pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease Hepato-biliary disorder - serious drug-induced liver injury, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Skin reactions – rash, urticaria, photosensitivity, erythema multiforme, bullous dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, DRESS, SJS/TEN, and AGEP Blood and Lymphatic System - decreased WBC Central/Peripheral Nervous System - convulsion, peripheral neuropathy, spinal fracture/paralysis Endocrine System - diabetes mellitus Musculoskeletal System - tenosynovitis-like symptoms Urogenital System - prostate pain"
