  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Dabigatran etexilate capsules are contraindicated in patients with: • Active pathological bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] • History of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate, or to one of the excipients of the product ( e.g. , anaphylactic reaction or anaphylactic shock ) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] • Mechanical prosthetic heart valve [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] • Active pathological bleeding ( 4 ) • History of serious hypersensitivity reaction to dabigatran etexilate capsules ( 4 ) • Mechanical prosthetic heart valve ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Bleeding: Dabigatran etexilate capsules can cause serious and fatal bleeding ( 5.2 ) • Bioprosthetic heart valves: Dabigatran etexilate capsules use not recommended ( 5.4 ) • Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome: Dabigatran etexilate capsules use not recommended ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including dabigatran etexilate capsules, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. If dabigatran etexilate capsules are discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant and restart dabigatran etexilate capsules as soon as medically appropriate [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 , 2.7 , 2.8 ) ] 5.2 Risk of Bleeding Dabigatran etexilate capsules increase the risk of bleeding and can cause significant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss ( e.g. , a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit or hypotension ) . Discontinue dabigatran etexilate capsules in patients with active pathological bleeding [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] . Risk factors for bleeding include the concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding ( e.g. , anti-platelet agents, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs ) . Dabigatran etexilate capsule’s anticoagulant activity and half-life are increased in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] . Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect In adults, a specific reversal agent ( idarucizumab ) for dabigatran etexilate capsules is available when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is needed: • For emergency surgery/urgent procedures • In life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding In pediatric patients, the efficacy and safety of idarucizumab have not been established. Hemodialysis can remove dabigatran; however, the clinical experience supporting the use of hemodialysis as a treatment for bleeding is limited [see . Prothrombin complex concentrates, or recombinant Factor VIIa may be considered but their use has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of dabigatran. Consider administration of platelet concentrates in cases where thrombocytopenia is present or long-acting antiplatelet drugs have been used. Overdosage ( 10 ) ] 5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture When neuraxial anesthesia ( spinal/epidural anesthesia ) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see . Boxed Warning ] To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of dabigatran and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran [see . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits ( numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs ) , bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae. 5.4 Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events in Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves The safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate capsules in adult patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves was evaluated in the RE-ALIGN trial, in which patients with bileaflet mechanical prosthetic heart valves ( recently implanted or implanted more than three months prior to enrollment ) were randomized to dose-adjusted warfarin or 150 mg, 220 mg, or 300 mg of dabigatran etexilate capsules twice a day. RE-ALIGN was terminated early due to the occurrence of significantly more thromboembolic events ( valve thrombosis, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction ) and an excess of major bleeding ( predominantly post-operative pericardial effusions requiring intervention for hemodynamic compromise ) in the dabigatran etexilate capsules treatment arm as compared to the warfarin treatment arm. These bleeding and thromboembolic events were seen both in patients who were initiated on dabigatran etexilate capsules postoperatively within three days of mechanical bileaflet valve implantation, as well as in patients whose valves had been implanted more than three months prior to enrollment. Therefore, the use of dabigatran etexilate capsules is contraindicated in all patients with mechanical prosthetic valves [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . The use of dabigatran etexilate capsules for the prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation in the setting of other forms of valvular heart disease, including the presence of a bioprosthetic heart valve, has not been studied and is not recommended. 5.5 Effect of P-gp Inducers and Inhibitors on Dabigatran Exposure The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate capsules with P-gp inducers ( e.g. , rifampin ) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided [see . Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone. Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients Reduce the dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules to 75 mg twice daily when dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole is co-administered with dabigatran etexilate capsules in patients with moderate renal impairment ( CrCl 30-50 mL/min ) . Avoid use of dabigatran etexilate capsules and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment ( CrCl 15-30 mL/min ) [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Avoid use of dabigatran etexilate capsules and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Following Hip Replacement Surgery Avoid use of dabigatran etexilate capsules and concomitant P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl < 50 mL/min [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] Treatment and Reduction in Risk of Recurrence of VTE in Pediatric Patients The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate capsules with P-gp-inhibitors has not been studied in pediatric patients but may increase exposure to dabigatran. 5.6 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome Direct-acting oral anticoagulants ( DOACs ) , including dabigatran etexilate capsules, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome ( APS ) . For patients with APS ( especially those who are triple-positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies] ) , treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] • Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] • Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] • Thromboembolic and Bleeding Events in Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] • Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple-Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] The most serious adverse reactions reported with dabigatran etexilate capsules were related to bleeding [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] • Most common adverse reactions ( > 15% ) are gastrointestinal adverse reactions and bleeding ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 ( 1-877-4-INFO-RX ) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Trials Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation The RE-LY ( Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulant Therapy ) study provided safety information on the use of two doses of dabigatran etexilate capsules and warfarin [see . The numbers of patients and their exposures are described in Table 2. Limited information is presented on the 110 mg dosing arm because this dose is not approved. Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] Table 2. Summary of Treatment Exposure in RE-LY Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 110 mg twice daily Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg twice daily Warfarin Total number treated 5.983 6.059 5.998 Exposure > 12 months 4.936 4.939 5.193 > 24 months 2.387 2.405 2.470 Mean exposure ( months ) 20.5 20.3 21.3 Total patient-years 10.242 10.261 10.659 Drug Discontinuation in RE-LY: The rates of adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were 21% for dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg and 16% for warfarin. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of dabigatran etexilate capsules were bleeding and gastrointestinal events ( i.e. , dyspepsia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and diarrhea ) . Bleeding: [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Table 3 shows the number of adjudicated major bleeding events during the treatment period in the RE-LY study, with the bleeding rate per 100 subject-years ( % ) . Major bleeding is defined as bleeding accompanied by one or more of the following: a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL, a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells, bleeding at a critical site or with a fatal outcome. Intracranial hemorrhage included intracerebral ( hemorrhagic stroke ) , subarachnoid, and subdural bleeds. Table 3. Adjudicated Major Bleeding Events in Treated Patients Patients during treatment or within 2 days of stopping study treatment. Major bleeding events within each subcategory were counted once per patient, but patients may have contributed events to multiple subcategories. Event Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg N = 6.059 n ( %/year Annual event rate per 100 pt-years = 100 * number of subjects with event/subject-years. Subject-years is defined as cumulative number of days from first drug intake to event date, date of last drug intake + 2, death date ( whatever occurred first ) across all treated subjects divided by 365.25. In case of recurrent events of the same category, the first event was considered. ) Warfarin N = 5.998 n ( %/year ) Dabigatran Etexilate Capsules 150 mg vs Warfarin HR ( 95% CI ) Major Bleeding Defined as bleeding accompanied by one or more of the following: a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL, a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells, bleeding at a critical site or with fatal outcome. 350 ( 3.47 ) 374 ( 3.58 ) 0.97 ( 0.84, 1.12 ) Intracranial Hemorrhage ( ICH ) Intracranial bleed included intracerebral ( hemorrhagic stroke ) , subarachnoid, and subdural bleeds. 23 ( 0.22 ) 82 ( 0.77 ) 0.29 ( 0.18, 0.46 ) Hemorrhagic Stroke On-treatment analysis based on the safety population, compared to ITT analysis presented in Section 14 Clinical Studies. 6 ( 0.06 ) 40 ( 0.37 ) 0.16 ( 0.07, 0.37 ) Other ICH 17 ( 0.17 ) 46 ( 0.43 ) 0.38 ( 0.22, 0.67 ) Gastrointestinal 162 ( 1.59 ) 111 ( 1.05 ) 1.51 ( 1.19, 1.92 ) Fatal Bleeding Fatal bleed: Adjudicated major bleed as defined above with investigator reported fatal outcome and adjudicated death with primary cause from bleeding. 7 ( 0.07 ) 16 ( 0.15 ) 0.45 ( 0.19, 1.10 ) ICH 3 ( 0.03 ) 9 ( 0.08 ) 0.35 ( 0.09, 1.28 ) Non-intracranial Non-intracranial fatal bleed: Adjudicated major bleed as defined above and adjudicated death with primary cause from bleeding but without symptomatic intracranial bleed based on investigator’s clinical assessment. 4 ( 0.04 ) 7 ( 0.07 ) 0.59 ( 0.17, 2.02 ) There was a higher rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds in patients receiving dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg than in patients receiving warfarin ( 6.6% vs 4.2% , respectively ) . The risk of major bleeds was similar with dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg and warfarin across major subgroups defined by baseline characteristics ( see Figure 1 ) , with the exception of age, where there was a trend toward a higher incidence of major bleeding on dabigatran etexilate capsules ( hazard ratio 1.2, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.5 ) for patients ≥ 75 years of age. Figure 1. Adjudicated Major Bleeding by Baseline Characteristics Including Hemorrhagic Stroke Treated Patients Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and all of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Patients on dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg had an increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( 35% vs 24% on warfarin ) . These were commonly dyspepsia ( including abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort ) and gastritis-like symptoms ( including GERD, esophagitis, erosive gastritis, gastric hemorrhage, hemorrhagic gastritis, hemorrhagic erosive gastritis, and gastrointestinal ulcer ) . Hypersensitivity Reactions: In the RE-LY study, drug hypersensitivity ( including urticaria, rash, and pruritus ) , allergic edema, anaphylactic reaction, and anaphylactic shock were reported in < 0.1% of patients receiving dabigatran etexilate capsules. Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism: Dabigatran etexilate capsules were studied in 4.387 patients in 4 pivotal, parallel, randomized, double-blind trials. Three of these trials were active-controlled ( warfarin ) ( RE-COVER, RE-COVER II, and RE-MEDY ) , and one study ( RE-SONATE ) was placebo-controlled. The demographic characteristics were similar among the 4 pivotal studies and between the treatment groups within these studies. Approximately 60% of the treated patients were male, with a mean age of 55.1 years. The majority of the patients were white ( 87.7% ) , 10.3% were Asian, and 1.9% were black with a mean CrCl of 105.6 mL/min. Bleeding events for the 4 pivotal studies were classified as major bleeding events if at least one of the following criteria applied: fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ ( intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal bleeding, intra-articular bleeding, or pericardial bleeding ) , bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2.0 g/dL ( 1.24 mmol/L or more, or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells ) . RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies compared dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg twice daily and warfarin for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Patients received 5-10 days of an approved parenteral anticoagulant therapy followed by 6 months, with mean exposure of 164 days, of oral only treatment; warfarin was overlapped with parenteral therapy. Table 4 shows the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the pooled analysis of RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies during the full treatment including parenteral and oral only treatment periods after randomization. Figure 1. Adjudicated Major Bleeding by Baseline Characteristics Including Hemorrhagic Stroke Treated Patients Treatment and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Dabigatran etexilate capsules were studied in 4.387 patients in 4 pivotal, parallel, randomized, double-blind trials.

RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies compared dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg twice daily and warfarin for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Patients received 5-10 days of an approved parenteral anticoagulant therapy followed by 6 months, with mean exposure of 164 days, of oral only treatment; warfarin was overlapped with parenteral therapy. Table 4 shows the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the pooled analysis of RE-COVER and RE-COVER II studies during the full treatment including parenteral and oral only treatment periods after randomization.

The RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE studies provided safety information on the use of dabigatran etexilate capsules for the reduction in the risk of recurrence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. RE-MEDY was an active-controlled study ( warfarin ) in which 1.430 patients received dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg twice daily following 3 to 12 months of oral anticoagulant regimen. Patients in the treatment studies who rolled over into the RE-MEDY study had a combined treatment duration of up to more than 3 years, with mean exposure of 473 days.

Clinical Myocardial Infarction Events: In the active-controlled VTE studies, a higher rate of clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received dabigatran etexilate capsules [20 ( 0.66 per 100 patient-years ) ] than in those who received warfarin [5 ( 0.17 per 100 patient-years ) ] . In the placebo-controlled study, a similar rate of nonfatal and fatal clinical myocardial infarction was reported in patients who received dabigatran etexilate capsules [1 ( 0.32 per 100 patient-years ) ] and in those who received placebo [1 ( 0.34 per 100 patient-years ) ] . Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: In the four pivotal studies, patients on dabigatran etexilate capsules 150 mg had a similar incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( 24.7% vs 22.7% on warfarin ) . Dyspepsia ( including abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort ) occurred in patients on dabigatran etexilate capsules in 7.5% vs 5.5% on warfarin, and gastritis-like symptoms ( including gastritis, GERD, esophagitis, erosive gastritis and gastric hemorrhage ) occurred at 3.0% vs 1.7% , respectively. Hypersensitivity Reactions: In the 4 pivotal studies, drug hypersensitivity ( including urticaria, rash, and pruritus ) , allergic edema, anaphylactic reaction, and anaphylactic shock were reported in 0.1% of patients receiving dabigatran etexilate capsules. Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism Following Hip Replacement Surgery Dabigatran etexilate capsules were studied in 5.476 patients, randomized and treated in two double-blind, active-controlled non-inferiority trials ( RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II ) . The demographic characteristics were similar across the two studies and between the treatment groups within these studies. Approximately 45.3% of the treated patients were male, with a mean age of 63.2 years. The majority of the patients were white ( 96.1% ) , 3.6% were Asian, and 0.3% were black with a mean CrCl of 92 mL/min. Bleeding events for the RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II studies were classified as major bleeding events if at least one of the following criteria applied: fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ ( intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal or retroperitoneal bleeding ) , bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2.0 g/dL ( 1.24 mmol/L ) or more, or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells, requiring treatment cessation or leading to re-operation. The RE-NOVATE study compared dabigatran etexilate capsules 75 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 150 mg once daily, dabigatran etexilate capsules 110 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 220 mg once daily and subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily initiated the evening before surgery for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who had undergone hip replacement surgery. The RE-NOVATE II study compared dabigatran etexilate capsules 110 mg taken orally 1-4 hours after surgery followed by 220 mg once daily and subcutaneous enoxaparin 40 mg once daily initiated the evening before surgery for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients who had undergone hip replacement surgery. In the RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II studies, patients received 28-35 days of dabigatran etexilate capsules or enoxaparin with median exposure of 33 days. Tables 7 and 8 show the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the analysis of RE-NOVATE and RE-NOVATE II. Table 7.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: In the two studies, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions for patients on dabigatran etexilate capsules 220 mg and enoxaparin was 39.5% and 39.5% , respectively. Dyspepsia ( including abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, and epigastric discomfort ) occurred in patients on dabigatran etexilate capsules 220 mg in 4.1% vs. 3.8% on enoxaparin, and gastritis-like symptoms ( including gastritis, GERD, esophagitis, erosive gastritis and gastric hemorrhage ) occurred at 0.6% vs 1.0% , respectively. Hypersensitivity Reactions: In the two studies, drug hypersensitivity ( such as urticaria, rash, and pruritus ) was reported in 0.3% of patients receiving dabigatran etexilate capsules 220 mg. Clinical Myocardial Infarction Events: In the two studies, clinical myocardial infarction was reported in 2 ( 0.1% ) of patients who received dabigatran etexilate capsules 220 mg and 6 ( 0.3% ) of patients who received enoxaparin. Pediatric Trials Treatment of VTE in Pediatric Patients The safety of dabigatran etexilate in the treatment of VTE in pediatric patients was studied in one phase III trial ( DIVERSITY ) . The DIVERSITY study was a randomized, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group trial comparing dabigatran etexilate with standard of care – SOC ( vitamin K antagonists, low molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux ) . There were 266 pediatric patients who received study treatment, 176 patients treated with dabigatran etexilate and 90 patients treated with SOC. Patients on dabigatran etexilate received age- and weight-adjusted dosages of an age-appropriate formulation of dabigatran etexilate ( capsules, pellets, or oral solution ) twice daily. Patients had a median age of 14 years ( range: 0-17 years ) , 92% were white, and half the patients were male ( 50% ) . Following at least 5 days of parenteral anticoagulant therapy, the median duration of treatment with dabigatran etexilate was 85 days ( range: 1-105 ) . Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) < 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were excluded from the trial. Bleeding: Data on adjudicated major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major ( CRNM ) bleeding and minor bleeding events, for the dabigatran etexilate group and the SOC group in the DIVERSITY study, are reported in Table 9. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to first major bleeding event. Table 9. Summary of All Adjudicated Bleeding Events During On-Treatment Period in DIVERSITY Dabigatran Etexilate N ( % ) Standard of Care ( SOC ) N ( % ) Patients N=176 N=90 Major bleeding event Major bleeding event if at least one of the following criteria applied: fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ ( intraocular, intracranial, intraspinal or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal bleeding, intra-articular bleeding, or pericardial bleeding ) , bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin level of 2.0 g/dL ( 1.24 mmol/L ) or more, or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells. 4 ( 2.3 ) 2 ( 2.2 ) Fatal bleeding 0 1 ( 1.1 ) Clinically relevant non-major bleeding 2 ( 1.1 ) 1 ( 1.1 ) Minor bleeding 33 ( 19 ) 21 ( 23 ) Major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding 6 ( 3.4 ) 3 ( 3.3 ) Any bleeding 38 ( 22 ) 22 ( 24 ) Site-specific bleeding rates were comparable between the two arms, with the exception of the rate of any gastrointestinal bleeds ( 5.7% in dabigatran etexilate arm vs 1.8% in SOC arm ) . Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions for patients on dabigatran etexilate and SOC was 32% and 12% , respectively, with the following occurring in ≥ 5% of patients taking dabigatran etexilate: dyspepsia ( including term gastro-esophageal reflux disease, gastric pH decreased and esophagitis ) in 9% ( vs 2% ) , upper abdominal pain in 5% ( vs 1% ) , vomiting in 8% ( vs 2% ) , nausea 5% ( vs 4% ) , and diarrhea 5% ( vs 1% ) . Reduction in Risk of Recurrence of VTE in Pediatric Patients The safety of dabigatran etexilate in the reduction in the risk of recurrence of VTE in pediatric patients was studied in one open-label single-arm trial ( Study 2 ) . Study 2 enrolled patients who required further anticoagulation due to the presence of a clinical risk factor after completing the initial treatment for confirmed VTE ( for at least 3 months ) or after completing the DIVERSITY study and received dabigatran etexilate until the clinical risk factor resolved, or up to a maximum of 12 months. There were 213 pediatric patients treated with dabigatran etexilate, in a similar fashion as in the DIVERSITY trial. Patients had a median age of 14 years ( range: 0-18 years ) , 91% were white, and 55% of patients were male. Patients previously enrolled on DIVERSITY accounted for 43% of patients enrolled on Study 2 ( 29% from dabigatran etexilate arm and 14% from SOC arm ) . The median duration of treatment with dabigatran etexilate in Study 2 was 42 weeks ( range: 0-56 weeks ) , with 45% of patients completing the 12-month planned duration, 17% stopping due to resolution of VTE risk factors, 12% stopping due to failure to attain target dabigatran concentration and 6% had an adverse event leading to discontinuation. During the on-treatment period of Study 2, 3 patients ( 1.4% ) had a major bleeding event, 3 patients ( 1.4% ) had a clinically relevant non-major bleeding event, and 44 patients ( 20% ) had a minor bleeding event. The most common drug-related adverse reactions were dyspepsia ( 5% ) , epistaxis ( 3.3% ) , nausea ( 3.3% ) and menorrhagia ( 2.8% ) . The adverse reaction profile in pediatric patients was generally consistent with that of adult patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of dabigatran etexilate capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
