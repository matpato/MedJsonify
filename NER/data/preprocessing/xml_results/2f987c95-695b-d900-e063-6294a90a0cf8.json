  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue escitalopram and serotonergic agents and initiate supportive treatment ( 4 , 5.2 ) Discontinuation syndrome: When discontinuing escitalopram, reduce dosage gradually whenever possible, and monitor for discontinuation symptoms ( 5.3 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with a history of seizure ( 5.4 ) Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) Hyponatremia: Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.6 ) Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other drugs that affect coagulation may increase risk ( 5.7 ) Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Use caution when operating machinery ( 5.8 ) Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants ( 5.9 ) Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness: Use caution in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses ( 5.10 ) Sexual Dysfunction: Escitalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs ( SSRIs and other antidepressant classes ) that included approximately 77.000 adult patients and 4.500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1 . Table 1: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18 to 24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 years old 1 fewer patient ≥65 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e. , beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing escitalopram, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome SSRIs, including escitalopram, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs ( including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort ) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. , MAOIs [ see ] . Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes ( e.g. , agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma ) , autonomic instability ( e.g. , tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular symptoms ( e.g. , tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination ) seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms ( e.g. , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ) . The concomitant use of escitalopram with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate escitalopram in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes ( such as oral tablets or local tissue injection ) . If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking escitalopram, discontinue escitalopram before initiating treatment with the MAOI [ see . Contraindications ( 4 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ] Monitor all patients taking escitalopram for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with escitalopram and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of escitalopram with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Discontinuation Syndrome During marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse reactions occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances ( e.g. , paresthesias such as electric shock sensations ) , anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Monitor for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with escitalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [ see ] . Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) 5.4 Seizures Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of escitalopram, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, escitalopram should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder. 5.5 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with escitalopram or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in major depressive disorder, activation of mania/hypomania was reported in one ( 0.1% ) of 715 patients treated with escitalopram and in none of the 592 patients treated with placebo. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with escitalopram treatment. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorders treated with racemic citalopram and other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Prior to initiating treatment with escitalopram, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [ see ] . Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) 5.6 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including escitalopram. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) , and was reversible when escitalopram was discontinued. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk [ see ] . Consider discontinuation of escitalopram in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. 5.7 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including escitalopram, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies ( case-control and cohort design ) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see . Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of escitalopram and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [ see ] . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) 5.8 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance In a study in normal volunteers, escitalopram 10 mg daily did not produce impairment of intellectual function or psychomotor performance. Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that escitalopram therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. 5.9 Angle Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including escitalopram, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. 5.10 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with escitalopram in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using escitalopram in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Escitalopram has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased. The recommended dose of escitalopram in hepatically impaired patients is 10 mg daily [ see ] . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) Because escitalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Until adequate numbers of patients with severe renal impairment have been evaluated during chronic treatment with escitalopram, however, it should be used with caution in such patients [ see ] . Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) 5.11 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including escitalopram, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [ see ] . In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of escitalopram and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history ( including timing of symptom onset ) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.",

Clinical Trial Data Sources Adults Adverse reactions information for escitalopram was collected from 715 patients with major depressive disorder who were exposed to escitalopram and from 592 patients who were exposed to placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. An additional 284 patients with major depressive disorder were newly exposed to escitalopram in open-label trials. The adverse reaction information for escitalopram in patients with GAD was collected from 429 patients exposed to escitalopram and from 427 patients exposed to placebo in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and tabulations that follow, standard World Health Organization ( WHO ) terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment emergent adverse event of the type listed. An event was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation. Pediatric Patients Adverse reaction information for pediatric patients was collected in double-blind placebo-controlled studies in 576 pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age, ( 286 escitalopram, 290 placebo ) with major depressive disorder. The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with MDD or less than 7 years of age with GAD. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment Major Depressive Disorder Adults Among the 715 depressed patients who received escitalopram in placebo-controlled trials, 6% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 2% of 592 patients receiving placebo. In two fixed-dose studies, the rate of discontinuation for adverse reactions in patients receiving 10 mg/day escitalopram was not significantly different from the rate of discontinuation for adverse reactions in patients receiving placebo. The rate of discontinuation for adverse reactions in patients assigned to a fixed dose of 20 mg/day escitalopram was 10% , which was significantly different from the rate of discontinuation for adverse reactions in patients receiving 10 mg/day escitalopram ( 4% ) and placebo ( 3% ) . Adverse reactions that were associated with the discontinuation of at least 1% of patients treated with escitalopram, and for which the rate was at least twice that of placebo, were nausea ( 2% ) and ejaculation disorder ( 2% of male patients ) . Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age were associated with discontinuation of 3.5% of 286 patients receiving escitalopram and 1% of 290 patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reaction ( incidence at least 1% for escitalopram and greater than placebo ) associated with discontinuation was insomnia ( 1% escitalopram, 0% placebo ) . The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with MDD. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Adults Among the 429 GAD patients who received escitalopram 10 to 20 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials, 8% discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 4% of 427 patients receiving placebo. Adverse reactions that were associated with the discontinuation of at least 1% of patients treated with escitalopram, and for which the rate was at least twice the placebo rate, were nausea ( 2% ) , insomnia ( 1% ) , and fatigue ( 1% ) . Incidence of Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Major Depressive Disorder Adults The most commonly observed adverse reactions in escitalopram patients ( incidence of approximately 5% or greater and approximately twice the incidence in placebo patients ) were insomnia, ejaculation disorder ( primarily ejaculatory delay ) , nausea, sweating increased, fatigue, and somnolence. Table 2 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred among 715 depressed patients who received escitalopram at doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials. Reactions included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with escitalopram and for which the incidence in patients treated with escitalopram was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients.

Pediatric Patients The overall profile of adverse reactions in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years in major depressive disorder was generally similar to that seen in adult studies, as shown in Table 2. However, the following adverse reactions ( excluding those which appear in Table 2 and those for which the coded terms were uninformative or misleading ) were reported at an incidence of at least 2% for escitalopram and greater than placebo: back pain, urinary tract infection, vomiting, and nasal congestion. The safety and effectiveness of escitalopram have not been established in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with MDD. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Adults The most commonly observed adverse reactions in escitalopram patients ( incidence of approximately 5% or greater and approximately twice the incidence in placebo patients ) were nausea, ejaculation disorder ( primarily ejaculatory delay ) , insomnia, fatigue, decreased libido, and anorgasmia. Table 3 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent of treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred among 429 GAD patients who received escitalopram 10 to 20 mg/day in placebo-controlled trials. Reactions included are those occurring in 2% or more of patients treated with escitalopram and for which the incidence in patients treated with escitalopram was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. TABLE 3 Adverse Reactions Observed with a Frequency of ≥ 2% and ˃ placebo for Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( Adults ) Adverse Reactions Escitalopram Placebo ( N=429 ) % ( N=427 ) % Autonomic Nervous System Disorders Dry Mouth 9% 5% Sweating Increased 4% 1% Central & Peripheral Nervous System Disorders Headache 24% 17% Paresthesia 2% 1% Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 18% 8% Diarrhea 8% 6% Constipation 5% 4% Indigestion 3% 2% Vomiting 3% 1% Abdominal Pain 2% 1% Flatulence 2% 1% Toothache 2% 0% General Fatigue 8% 2% Influenza-like Symptoms 5% 4% Musculoskeletal System Disorder Neck/Shoulder Pain 3% 1% Psychiatric Disorders Somnolence 13% 7% Insomnia 12% 6% Libido Decreased 7% 2% Dreaming Abnormal 3% 2% Appetite Decreased 3% 1% Lethargy 3% 1% Respiratory System Disorders Yawning 2% 1% Urogenital Ejaculation Disorder 1.2 14% 2% Anorgasmia 3 6% <1% Menstrual Disorder 2% 1% 1 Primarily ejaculatory delay. 2 Denominator used was for males only ( N=182 escitalopram; N=195 placebo ) . 3 Denominator used was for females only ( N=247 escitalopram; N=232 placebo ) . Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions The potential dose dependency of common adverse reactions ( defined as an incidence rate of ≥5% in either the 10 mg or 20 mg escitalopram groups ) was examined on the basis of the combined incidence of adverse reactions in two fixed-dose trials. The overall incidence rates of adverse reactions in 10 mg escitalopram-treated patients ( 66% ) was similar to that of the placebo-treated patients ( 61% ) , while the incidence rate in 20 mg/day escitalopram-treated patients was greater ( 86% ) . Table 4 shows common adverse reactions that occurred in the 20 mg/day escitalopram group with an incidence that was approximately twice that of the 10 mg/day escitalopram group and approximately twice that of the placebo group. TABLE 4 Incidence of Common Adverse Reactions in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Adverse Reaction Placebo ( N=311 ) 10 mg/day Escitalopram ( N=310 ) 20 mg/day Escitalopram ( N=125 ) Insomnia 4% 7% 14% Diarrhea 5% 6% 14% Dry Mouth 3% 4% 9% Somnolence 1% 4% 9% Dizziness 2% 4% 7% Sweating Increased <1% 3% 8% Constipation 1% 3% 6% Fatigue 2% 2% 6% Indigestion 1% 2% 6% Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that SSRIs can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. TABLE 5 Incidence of Sexual Side Effects in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Adverse Event Escitalopram Placebo In Males Only ( N=407 ) ( N=383 ) Ejaculation Disorder ( primarily ejaculatory delay ) 12% 1% Libido Decreased 6% 2% Impotence 2% <1% In Females Only ( N=737 ) ( N=636 ) Libido Decreased 3% 1% Anorgasmia 3% <1% There are no adequately designed studies examining sexual dysfunction with escitalopram treatment. Priapism has been reported with all SSRIs. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. Vital Sign Changes Escitalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to ( 1 ) mean change from baseline in vital signs ( pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure ) and ( 2 ) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses did not reveal any clinically important changes in vital signs associated with escitalopram treatment. In addition, a comparison of supine and standing vital sign measures in subjects receiving escitalopram indicated that escitalopram treatment is not associated with orthostatic changes. Weight Changes Patients treated with escitalopram in controlled trials did not differ from placebo-treated patients with regard to clinically important change in body weight. Laboratory Changes Escitalopram and placebo groups were compared with respect to ( 1 ) mean change from baseline in various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables, and ( 2 ) the incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant changes from baseline in these variables. These analyses revealed no clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters associated with escitalopram treatment. ECG Changes Electrocardiograms from escitalopram ( N=625 ) and placebo ( N=527 ) groups were compared with respect to outliers defined as subjects with QTc changes over 60 msec from baseline or absolute values over 500 msec post-dose, and subjects with heart rate increases to over 100 bpm or decreases to less than 50 bpm with a 25% change from baseline ( tachycardic or bradycardic outliers, respectively ) . None of the patients in the escitalopram group had a QTcF interval >500 msec or a prolongation >60 msec compared to 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. The incidence of tachycardic outliers was 0.2% in the escitalopram and the placebo group. The incidence of bradycardic outliers was 0.5% in the escitalopram group and 0.2% in the placebo group. QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active ( moxifloxacin 400 mg ) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple dose study in 113 healthy subjects. The maximum mean ( 95% upper confidence bound ) difference from placebo arm were 4.5 ( 6.4 ) and 10.7 ( 12.7 ) msec for 10 mg and supratherapeutic 30 mg escitalopram given once daily, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcF change from placebo arm ( 95% confidence interval ) under the C max for the dose of 20 mg is 6.6 ( 7.9 ) msec. Escitalopram 30 mg given once daily resulted in mean C max of 1.7-fold higher than the mean C max for the maximum recommended therapeutic dose at steady state ( 20 mg ) . The exposure under supratherapeutic 30 mg dose is similar to the steady state concentrations expected in CYP2 C19 poor metabolizers following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg. Other Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Escitalopram Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse reactions, as defined in the introduction to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section, reported by the 1428 patients treated with escitalopram for periods of up to one year in double-blind or open-label clinical trials during its premarketing evaluation. The listing does not include those reactions already listed in Tables 2 & 3 , those reactions for which a drug cause was remote and at a rate less than 1% or lower than placebo, those reactions which were so general as to be uninformative, and those reactions reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life threatening. Reactions are categorized by body system. Reactions of major clinical importance are described in the Warnings and Precautions section ( 5 ) . Cardiovascular : hypertension, palpitation. Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorders : light-headed feeling, migraine. Gastrointestinal Disorders : abdominal cramp, heartburn, gastroenteritis. General : allergy, chest pain, fever, hot flushes, pain in limb. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : increased weight. Musculoskeletal System Disorders : arthralgia, myalgia jaw stiffness. Psychiatric Disorders : appetite increased, concentration impaired, irritability. Reproductive Disorders/Female : menstrual cramps, menstrual disorder. Respiratory System Disorders : bronchitis, coughing, nasal congestion, sinus congestion, sinus headache. Skin and Appendages Disorders : rash. Special Senses : vision blurred, tinnitus. Urinary System Disorders : urinary frequency, urinary tract infection. Additional pediatric use information is approved for AbbVie Inc.’s LEXAPRO ( escitalopram ) tablets and LEXAPRO ( escitalopram ) oral solution. However, due to AbbVie Inc.’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience Adverse Reactions Reported Subsequent to the Marketing of Escitalopram The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of escitalopram.
