    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS LABA as monotherapy (without an inhaled corticosteroid) for asthma increases the risk of serious asthma-related events. ( 5.1 ) Do not initiate STIOLTO RESPIMAT in acutely deteriorating COPD patients. ( 5.2 ) Do not use for relief of acute symptoms. Concomitant short-acting beta 2 -agonists can be used as needed for acute relief. ( 5.2 ) Do not exceed the recommended dosage. Excessive use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT, or use in conjunction with other medications containing LABA can result in clinically significant cardiovascular effects and may be fatal. ( 5.3 ) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions: Discontinue STIOLTO RESPIMAT at once and consider alternatives if immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis, occur. ( 5.4 ) Life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm can occur. Discontinue STIOLTO RESPIMAT immediately. ( 5.5 ) Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, or sensitivity to sympathomimetic drugs. ( 5.6 , 5.7 ) Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma may occur. Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.8 ) Worsening of urinary retention may occur. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction and instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if this occurs. ( 5.9 ) Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. ( 5.11 ) 5.1\tSerious Asthma-Related Events â€“ Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death The safety and efficacy of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in patients with asthma have not been established. STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not indicated for the treatment of asthma [see . Contraindications (4) ] Use of long-acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists (LABA) as monotherapy [without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)] for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone. A 28-week, placebo-controlled US study comparing the safety of another LABA (salmeterol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.25, 15.34). The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA, including olodaterol, one of the active ingredients in STIOLTO RESPIMAT. No study adequate to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased in patients treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT has been conducted. Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD. 5.2\tDeterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. STIOLTO RESPIMAT has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT in this setting is inappropriate. STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. STIOLTO RESPIMAT has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonist. When beginning STIOLTO RESPIMAT, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing STIOLTO RESPIMAT, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta 2 -agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated. COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If STIOLTO RESPIMAT no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta 2 -agonist becomes less effective or the patient needs more inhalation of short-acting beta 2 -agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of STIOLTO RESPIMAT beyond the recommended dosage is not appropriate in this situation. 5.3\tExcessive Use of STIOLTO RESPIMAT and Use With Other Long-Acting Beta 2 -Agonists As with other inhaled drugs containing beta 2 -adrenergic agents, STIOLTO RESPIMAT should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing long-acting beta 2 -agonists, as an overdose may result. Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. 5.4\tImmediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue or throat), rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, or itching may occur after administration of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be stopped at once and alternative treatments should be considered. Given the similar structural formula of atropine to tiotropium, patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine or its derivatives should be closely monitored for similar hypersensitivity reactions to STIOLTO RESPIMAT. 5.5\tParadoxical Bronchospasm As with other inhaled medicines, STIOLTO RESPIMAT may cause paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be stopped immediately and alternative therapy instituted. 5.6\tCardiovascular Effects Olodaterol, like other beta 2 -agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If such effects occur, STIOLTO RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Long acting beta 2 -adrenergic agonists should be administered with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. 5.7\tCoexisting Conditions Olodaterol, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, in patients with known or suspected prolongation of the QT interval, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Doses of the related beta 2 -agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. 5.8\tWorsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.9\tWorsening of Urinary Retention STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction (e.g., difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately should any of these signs or symptoms develop. 5.10\tRenal Impairment Because tiotropium is a predominantly renally excreted drug, patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min) treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT should be monitored closely for anticholinergic side effects [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.11\tHypokalemia and Hyperglycemia Beta-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects [see . The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Inhalation of high doses of beta Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] 2 -adrenergic agonists may produce increases in plasma glucose. In patients with severe COPD, hypokalemia may be potentiated by hypoxia and concomitant treatment [see , which may increase the susceptibility for cardiac arrhythmias. Drug Interactions (7.2) ] Clinically notable decreases in serum potassium or changes in blood glucose were infrequent during clinical studies with long-term administration of olodaterol with the rates similar to those for placebo controls. Olodaterol has not been investigated in patients whose diabetes mellitus is not well controlled.",

The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Paradoxical bronchospasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Worsening of urinary retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] The most common adverse reactions (>3% incidence and more than an active control) were nasopharyngitis, cough, and back pain. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-542-6257 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the incidence of adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the incidences in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. The clinical program for STIOLTO RESPIMAT included 7,151 subjects with COPD in two 52-week active-controlled trials, one 12-week placebo-controlled trial, three 6-week placebo-controlled cross-over trials, and four additional trials of shorter duration. A total of 1,988 subjects received at least 1 dose of STIOLTO RESPIMAT. Adverse reactions observed in the â‰¤12-week trials were consistent with those observed in the 52-week trials, which formed the primary safety database. The primary safety database consisted of pooled data from the two 52-week double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group confirmatory clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2). These trials included 5,162 adult COPD patients (72.9% males and 27.1% females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 1,029 were treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT once daily. The STIOLTO RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasians (71.1%) with a mean age of 63.8 years and a mean percent predicted FEV 1 at baseline of 43.2%. In these two trials, tiotropium 5 mcg and olodaterol 5 mcg were included as active control arms and no placebo was used. In these two clinical trials, 74% of patients exposed to STIOLTO RESPIMAT reported an adverse reaction compared to 76.6% and 73.3% in the olodaterol 5 mcg and tiotropium 5 mcg groups, respectively. The proportion of patients who discontinued due to an adverse reaction was 7.4% for STIOLTO RESPIMAT treated patients compared to 9.9% and 9.0% for olodaterol 5 mcg and tiotropium 5 mcg treated patients. The adverse reaction most commonly leading to discontinuation was worsening COPD. The most common serious adverse reactions were COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. Table 1 shows all adverse drug reactions that occurred with an incidence of >3% in the STIOLTO RESPIMAT treatment group and a higher incidence rate than the active comparator groups listed. Table 1 Number and frequency of adverse drug reactions greater than 3% (and higher than any of the comparators tiotropium and/or olodaterol) in COPD patients exposed to STIOLTO RESPIMAT: Pooled data from the two 52-week, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trials in COPD patients 40 years of age and older Treatment STIOLTO RESPIMAT (once daily) Tiotropium (5 mcg once daily) Olodaterol (5 mcg once daily) Body system (adverse drug reaction) n=1,029 n (%) n=1,033 n (%) n=1,038 n (%) Infections and infestations Nasopharyngitis 128 (12.4) 121 (11.7) 131 (12.6) Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders Cough 40 (3.9) 45 (4.4) 31 (3.0) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back Pain 37 (3.6) 19 (1.8) 35 (3.4) Other adverse drug reactions in patients receiving STIOLTO RESPIMAT that occurred in â‰¤3% of patients in clinical studies are listed below: Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration Nervous system disorders: dizziness, insomnia Eye disorders: glaucoma, intraocular pressure increased, vision blurred Cardiac/vascular disorders: atrial fibrillation, palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia, tachycardia, hypertension Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pharyngitis, dysphonia, bronchospasm, laryngitis, sinusitis Gastrointestinal disorders: dry mouth, constipation, oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gingivitis, glossitis, stomatitis, intestinal obstruction including ileus paralytic Skin and subcutaneous disorders: rash, pruritus, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, skin infection, and skin ulcer, dry skin, hypersensitivity (including immediate reactions) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, joint swelling Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, dysuria, and urinary tract infection COPD Exacerbation Reduction Trial In a one year trial (Trial 5) of 7,880 patients to compare rates of COPD exacerbations, 3,939 patients were treated with STIOLTO RESPIMAT and 3,941 patients were treated with tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray. The safety profile of STIOLTO RESPIMAT was similar to that of tiotropium 5 mcg inhalation spray and consistent with that documented in the STIOLTO RESPIMAT primary safety database."
