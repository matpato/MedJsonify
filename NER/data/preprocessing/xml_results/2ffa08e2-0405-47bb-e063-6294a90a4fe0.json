  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis have been reported with systemic use of levofloxacin as well as topical use of other fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin ophthalmic solution. ( 5.1 ) Prolonged use may result in the overgrowth of non- susceptible organisms, including fungi. ( 5.2 ) Patients should not wear contact lenses if they have signs or symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions In patients receiving systemically administered quinolones, including levofloxacin, serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity ( anaphylactic ) reactions have been reported, some following the first dose. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema, ( including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema ) , airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria and itching. If allergic reaction to levofloxacin occurs, discontinue the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment. Oxygen and airway management should be administered as clinically indicated. 5.2 Growth of Resistant Organisms with Prolonged Use As with other anti-infectives, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification, such as slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and where appropriate, fluorescein staining. 5.3 Avoidance of Contact Lens Wear Patients should be advised not to wear contact lenses if they have signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis.",
