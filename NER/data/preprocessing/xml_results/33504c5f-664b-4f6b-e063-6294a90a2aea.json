    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pigmentation ( 5.1 ) Eyelash changes ( 5.2 ) Ocular Inflammation ( 5.3 ) Macular Edema ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Pigmentation Omlonti (omidenepag isopropyl ophthalmic solution) 0.002%, is a prodrug of omidenepag, a relatively selective EP2 receptor agonist. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as omidenepag isopropyl ophthalmic solution is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of Omlonti, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes are likely to be reversible in most patients. Patients who receive prostaglandin analogs, including Omlonti, should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation, including permanent changes. The long-term effects of increased pigmentation are not known. Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with Omlonti (omidenepag isopropyl ophthalmic solution), 0.002% can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly [see . Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.2 Eyelash Changes Omlonti may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, thickness, and the number of lashes or hairs. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. 5.3 Ocular Inflammation Ocular inflammation has been reported in patients taking Omlonti. Omlonti should be used with caution in patients with active ocular inflammation, including iritis/uveitis. 5.4 Macular Edema Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during clinical trials in patients with pseudophakia receiving Omlonti. Omlonti should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema. 5.5 Risk of Contamination and Potential Injury to the Eye Advise patients to avoid touching the tip of the bottle to the eye or any surface, as this may contaminate the solution. Advise patients to not touch the tip to their eye to avoid the potential for injury to the eye.",
