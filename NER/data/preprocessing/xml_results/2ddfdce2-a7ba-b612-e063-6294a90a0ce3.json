    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Prasugrel tablets are a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows: Patients with unstable angina or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (1.1) . Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when managed with either primary or delayed PCI (1.1) . 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome Prasugrel tablets are indicated to reduce the rate of thrombotic CV events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who are to be managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as follows: Patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when managed with primary or delayed PCI. Prasugrel tablets have been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke compared to clopidogrel. The difference between treatments was driven predominantly by MI, with no difference on strokes and little difference on CV death [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Active pathological bleeding (4.1) Prior transient ischemic attack or stroke (4.2) Hypersensitivity to prasugrel or any component of the product (4.3) 4.1 Active Bleeding Prasugrel tablets are contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 4.2 Prior Transient Ischemic Attack or Stroke Prasugrel tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. In TRITON-TIMI 38 ( TR ial to Assess I mprovement in T herapeutic Outcomes by O ptimizing Platelet Inhibitio N with Prasugrel), patients with a history of TIA or ischemic stroke (>3 months prior to enrollment) had a higher rate of stroke on prasugrel tablets (6.5%; of which 4.2% were thrombotic stroke and 2.3% were intracranial hemorrhage [ICH]) than on clopidogrel (1.2%; all thrombotic). In patients without such a history, the incidence of stroke was 0.9% (0.2% ICH) and 1.0% (0.3% ICH) with prasugrel tablets and clopidogrel, respectively. Patients with a history of ischemic stroke within 3 months of screening and patients with a history of hemorrhagic stroke at any time were excluded from TRITON-TIMI 38. Patients who experience a stroke or TIA while on prasugrel tablets generally should have therapy discontinued [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . 4.3 Hypersensitivity Prasugrel tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to prasugrel or any component of the product [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS CABG-related bleeding: Risk increases in patients receiving prasugrel who undergo CABG (5.2) . Discontinuation of Prasugrel: Premature discontinuation increases risk of stent thrombosis, MI, and death (5.3) . Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP has been reported with prasugrel (5.4) . Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity including angioedema has been reported with prasugrel including in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to other thienopyridines (5.5) . 5.1 General Risk of Bleeding Thienopyridines, including prasugrel, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥3 g/dL but <5 g/dL), bleeding events were more common on prasugrel than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days). Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding. Do not use prasugrel in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1 , . 4.2) ] Other risk factors for bleeding are: Age ≥75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥75 years of age, use of prasugrel is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14) ] . CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Body weight <60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7 , . 8.8) ] Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2 , 7.4 ) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7 to 10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of prasugrel’s active metabolite is short relative to the lifetime of the platelet, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective. Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events. 5.2 Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery-Related Bleeding The risk of bleeding is increased in patients receiving prasugrel who undergo CABG. If possible, prasugrel should be discontinued at least 7 days prior to CABG. Of the 437 patients who underwent CABG during TRITON-TIMI 38, the rates of CABG-related TIMI Major or Minor bleeding were 14.1% in the prasugrel group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The higher risk for bleeding events in patients treated with prasugrel persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug. For patients receiving a thienopyridine within 3 days prior to CABG, the frequencies of TIMI Major or Minor bleeding were 26.7% (12 of 45 patients) in the prasugrel group, compared with 5.0% (3 of 60 patients) in the clopidogrel group. For patients who received their last dose of thienopyridine within 4 to 7 days prior to CABG, the frequencies decreased to 11.3% (9 of 80 patients) in the prasugrel group and 3.4% (3 of 89 patients) in the clopidogrel group. Do not start prasugrel in patients likely to undergo urgent CABG. CABG-related bleeding may be treated with transfusion of blood products, including packed red blood cells and platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 6 hours of the loading dose or 4 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective. 5.3 Discontinuation of Prasugrel Discontinue thienopyridines, including prasugrel, for active bleeding, elective surgery, stroke, or TIA. The optimal duration of thienopyridine therapy is unknown. In patients who are managed with PCI and stent placement, premature discontinuation of any antiplatelet medication, including thienopyridines, conveys an increased risk of stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. Patients who require premature discontinuation of a thienopyridine will be at increased risk for cardiac events. Lapses in therapy should be avoided, and if thienopyridines must be temporarily discontinued because of an adverse event(s), they should be restarted as soon as possible [see Contraindications (4.1 , 4.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) TTP has been reported with the use of prasugrel. TTP can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks). TTP is a serious condition that can be fatal and requires urgent treatment, including plasmapheresis (plasma exchange). TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes [fragment red blood cells] seen on peripheral smear), neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . 5.5 Hypersensitivity Including Angioedema Hypersensitivity including angioedema has been reported in patients receiving prasugrel, including patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to other thienopyridines [see Contraindications (4.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] .",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Including Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, is the most commonly reported adverse reaction (6.1) .

The population treated with prasugrel was 27 to 96 years of age, 25% female, and 92% Caucasian. All patients in the TRITON-TIMI 38 study were to receive aspirin. The dose of clopidogrel in this study was a 300 mg loading dose and 75 mg once daily. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with the rates observed in other clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Drug Discontinuation The rate of study drug discontinuation because of adverse reactions was 7.2% for prasugrel and 6.3% for clopidogrel. Bleeding was the most common adverse reaction leading to study drug discontinuation for both drugs (2.5% for prasugrel and 1.4% for clopidogrel). Bleeding Bleeding Unrelated to CABG Surgery In TRITON-TIMI 38, overall rates of TIMI Major or Minor bleeding adverse reactions unrelated to coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) were significantly higher on prasugrel than on clopidogrel, as shown in Table 1.

Table 2: Bleeding Rates for Non-CABG-Related Bleeding by Weight and Age (TRITON-TIMI 38) Major/Minor Fatal Prasugrel (%) 10 mg prasugrel maintenance dose Clopidogrel 75 mg clopidogrel maintenance dose (%) Prasugrel (%) Clopidogrel (%) Weight <60 kg (N=308 prasugrel, N=356 clopidogrel) 10.1 6.5 0.0 0.3 Weight ≥60 kg (N=6373 prasugrel, N=6299 clopidogrel) 4.2 3.3 0.3 0.1 Age <75 years (N=5850 prasugrel, N=5822 clopidogrel) 3.8 2.9 0.2 0.1 Age ≥75 years (N=891 prasugrel, N=894 clopidogrel) 9.0 6.9 1.0 0.1 Bleeding Related to CABG In TRITON-TIMI 38, 437 patients who received a thienopyridine underwent CABG during the course of the study. The rate of CABG-related TIMI Major or Minor bleeding was 14.1% for the prasugrel group and 4.5% in the clopidogrel group (see Table 3). The higher risk for bleeding adverse reactions in patients treated with prasugrel persisted up to 7 days from the most recent dose of study drug. Table 3: CABG-Related Bleeding Patients may be counted in more than one row. (TRITON-TIMI 38) Prasugrel (%) (N=213) Clopidogrel (%) (N=224) TIMI Major or Minor bleeding 14.1 4.5 TIMI Major bleeding 11.3 3.6 Fatal 0.9 0 Reoperation 3.8 0.5 Transfusion of ≥5 units 6.6 2.2 Intracranial hemorrhage 0 0 TIMI Minor bleeding 2.8 0.9 Bleeding Reported as Adverse Reactions Hemorrhagic events reported as adverse reactions in TRITON-TIMI 38 were, for prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively: epistaxis (6.2%, 3.3%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1.5%, 1.0%), hemoptysis (0.6%, 0.5%), subcutaneous hematoma (0.5%, 0.2%), post-procedural hemorrhage (0.5%, 0.2%), retroperitoneal hemorrhage (0.3%, 0.2%), pericardial effusion/hemorrhage/tamponade (0.3%, 0.2%), and retinal hemorrhage (0.0%, 0.1%). Malignancies During TRITON-TIMI 38, newly diagnosed malignancies were reported in 1.6% and 1.2% of patients treated with prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively. The sites contributing to the differences were primarily colon and lung. In another Phase 3 clinical study of ACS patients not undergoing PCI, in which data for malignancies were prospectively collected, newly diagnosed malignancies were reported in 1.8% and 1.7% of patients treated with prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively. The site of malignancies was balanced between treatment groups except for colorectal malignancies. The rates of colorectal malignancies were 0.3% prasugrel, 0.1% clopidogrel and most were detected during investigation of GI bleed or anemia. It is unclear if these observations are causally related, are the result of increased detection because of bleeding, or are random occurrences. Other Adverse Events In TRITON-TIMI 38, common and other important nonhemorrhagic adverse events were, for prasugrel and clopidogrel, respectively: severe thrombocytopenia (0.06%, 0.04%), anemia (2.2%, 2.0%), abnormal hepatic function (0.22%, 0.27%), allergic reactions (0.36%, 0.36%), and angioedema (0.06%, 0.04%). Table 4 summarizes the adverse events reported by at least 2.5% of patients.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
