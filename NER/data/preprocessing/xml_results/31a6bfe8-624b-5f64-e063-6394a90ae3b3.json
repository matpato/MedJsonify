    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Finasteride is contraindicated in the following: Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication. Pregnancy. Finasteride use is contraindicated in women when they are or may potentially be pregnant. Because of the ability of Type II 5α-reductase inhibitors to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), finasteride may cause abnormalities of the external genitalia of a male fetus of a pregnant woman who receives finasteride. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if pregnancy occurs while taking this drug, the pregnant woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to the male fetus. In female rats, low doses of finasteride administered during pregnancy have produced abnormalities of the external genitalia in male offspring.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Finasteride reduces serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on Finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor ( ). 5.1 Finasteride may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer ( , ). 5.2 6.1 Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant due to potential risk to a male fetus ( , , ). 5.3 8.1 16 Finasteride is not indicated for use in pediatric patients or women ( , , , , ). 5.4 8.1 8.3 8.4 12.3 Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms ( ). 5.6 5.1 Effects on Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical studies, finasteride reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within six months of treatment. This decrease is predictable over the entire range of PSA values in patients with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. For interpretation of serial PSAs in men taking finasteride, a new PSA baseline should be established at least six months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on finasteride may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Non-compliance with finasteride therapy may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in patients treated with finasteride for six months or more, PSA values should be doubled for comparison with normal ranges in untreated men. These adjustments preserve the utility of PSA to detect prostate cancer in men treated with finasteride. Finasteride may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. The ratio of free to total PSA (percent free PSA) remains constant even under the influence of finasteride. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men undergoing finasteride therapy, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-Grade Prostate Cancer Men aged 55 and over with a normal digital rectal examination and PSA ≤3.0 ng/mL at baseline taking finasteride 5 mg/day in the 7-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) had an increased risk of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer (finasteride 1.8% vs placebo 1.1%). Similar results were observed in a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART) (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). 5α-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5α-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume, or study-related factors, impacted the results of these studies has not been established. [See and .] Indications and Usage (1.3) Adverse Reactions (6.1) 5.3 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus Women should not handle crushed or broken finasteride tablets when they are pregnant or may potentially be pregnant because of the possibility of absorption of finasteride and the subsequent potential risk to a male fetus. Finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg are coated and will prevent contact with the active ingredient during normal handling, provided that the tablets have not been broken or crushed.

A 0.6 mL (22.1%) median decrease in ejaculate volume with a concomitant reduction in total sperm per ejaculate was observed. These parameters remained within the normal range and were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy with an average time to return to baseline of 84 weeks. 5.6 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to initiating treatment with finasteride, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist. Patients with large residual urinary volume and/or severely diminished urinary flow should be carefully monitored for obstructive uropathy. These patients may not be candidates for finasteride therapy.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The drug-related adverse reactions, reported in ≥1% in patients treated with finasteride and greater than in patients treated with placebo over a 4-year study are: impotence, decreased libido, decreased volume of ejaculate, breast enlargement, breast tenderness and rash ( ). 6.1 . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Finasteride is generally well tolerated; adverse reactions usually have been mild and transient. 4-Year Placebo-Controlled Study (a Long-Term Efficacy and Safety Study) In a long-term efficacy and safety study, 1524 patients treated with finasteride and 1516 patients treated with placebo were evaluated for safety over a period of 4 years. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to sexual function. 3.7% (57 patients) treated with finasteride and 2.1% (32 patients) treated with placebo discontinued therapy as a result of adverse reactions related to sexual function, which are the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Table 1 presents the only clinical adverse reactions considered possibly, probably or definitely drug related by the investigator, for which the incidence on finasteride was ≥1% and greater than placebo over the 4 years of the study. In years 2 to 4 of the study, there was no significant difference between treatment groups in the incidences of impotence, decreased libido and ejaculation disorder.

Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) Study In the MTOPS study, 3047 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to receive finasteride 5 mg/day (n=768), doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=756), the combination of finasteride 5 mg/day and doxazosin 4 or 8 mg/day (n=786), or placebo (n=737) for 4 to 6 years. [See .] Clinical Studies (14.2) The incidence rates of drug-related adverse experiences reported by ≥2% of patients in any treatment group in the MTOPS Study are listed in Table 2. The individual adverse effects which occurred more frequently in the combination group compared to either drug alone were: asthenia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, dizziness, decreased libido, rhinitis, abnormal ejaculation, impotence and abnormal sexual function (see Table 2). Of these, the incidence of abnormal ejaculation in patients receiving combination therapy was comparable to the sum of the incidences of this adverse experience reported for the two monotherapies. Combination therapy with finasteride and doxazosin was associated with no new clinical adverse experience. Four patients in MTOPS reported the adverse experience breast cancer. Three of these patients were on finasteride only and one was on combination therapy. [See Long-Term Data.] The MTOPS Study was not specifically designed to make statistical comparisons between groups for reported adverse experiences. In addition, direct comparisons of safety data between the MTOPS study and previous studies of the single agents may not be appropriate based upon differences in patient population, dosage or dose regimen, and other procedural and study design elements. Table 2: Incidence ≥2% in One or More Treatment Groups: Drug-Related Clinical Adverse Experiences in MTOPS Adverse Experience Placebo (N=737) (%) Doxazosin 4 mg or 8 mg Doxazosin dose was achieved by weekly titration (1 to 2 to 4 to 8 mg). The final tolerated dose (4 mg or 8 mg) was administered at end-Week 4. Only those patients tolerating at least 4 mg were kept on doxazosin. The majority of patients received the 8-mg dose over the duration of the study.

Men received either finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg (finasteride 5 mg) or placebo daily. Patients were evaluated annually with PSA and digital rectal exams. Biopsies were performed for elevated PSA, an abnormal digital rectal exam, or the end of study. The incidence of Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer was higher in men treated with finasteride (1.8%) than in those treated with placebo (1.1%) . In a 4-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5α-reductase inhibitor (dutasteride, AVODART), similar results for Gleason score 8 to 10 prostate cancer were observed (1% dutasteride vs 0.5% placebo). [see and ] Indications and Usage (1.3) Warnings and Precautions (5.2) No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with finasteride. Breast Cancer During the 4 to 6-year placebo and comparator-controlled MTOPS study that enrolled 3047 men, there were 4 cases of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride but no cases in men not treated with finasteride. During the 4-year, placebo-controlled long-term efficacy and safety study that enrolled 3040 men, there were 2 cases of breast cancer in placebo-treated men but no cases in men treated with finasteride. During the 7-year placebo-controlled Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) that enrolled 18,882 men, there was 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with finasteride, and 1 case of breast cancer in men treated with placebo. The relationship between long-term use of finasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Sexual Function There is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment with finasteride. New reports of drug-related sexual adverse experiences decreased with duration of therapy. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse events have been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride tablets USP, 5 mg. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema (including swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, and face) testicular pain sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido and ejaculation disorders (e.g. reduced ejaculate volume). These events were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Most men were older and were taking concomitant medications and/or had co-morbid conditions. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. male infertility and/or poor seminal quality were reported rarely in men taking finasteride for the treatment of BPH. Normalization or improvement of poor seminal quality has been reported after discontinuation of finasteride. The independent role of finasteride in these events is unknown. depression male breast cancer. The following additional adverse event related to sexual dysfunction that continued after discontinuation of treatment has been reported in postmarketing experience with finasteride at lower doses used to treat male pattern baldness. Because the event is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate its frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: orgasm disorders"
