    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • HIV-1 PrEP: Comprehensive management to reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. ( 5.1 ) • Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with cabotegravir and include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Discontinue VOCABRIA immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop. ( 5.2 ) • Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving cabotegravir. Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended when VOCABRIA is used for HIV-1 treatment. Clinical and laboratory monitoring should be considered when VOCABRIA is used for HIV-1 PrEP. Discontinue VOCABRIA if hepatotoxicity is suspected. ( 5.3 ) • Depressive disorders have been reported with VOCABRIA when used with EDURANT for HIV-1 treatment. Prompt evaluation is recommended for depressive symptoms. ( 5.4 ) • Risks Associated with Combination Treatment: Review the prescribing information for EDURANT for information on rilpivirine prior to initiation of VOCABRIA in combination with EDURANT. ( 5.6 ) 5.1\tComprehensive Management to Reduce the Risk of HIV-1 Infection When VOCABRIA is Used for HIV-1 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Use of VOCABRIA for HIV-1 PrEP should be part of a comprehensive prevention strategy including adherence to the dosing schedule and safer sex practices, including condoms, to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). VOCABRIA is not always effective in preventing HIV-1 acquisition [see Clinical Studies ( . The time from initiation of VOCABRIA for HIV-1 PrEP to maximal protection against HIV-1 infection is unknown. 14.2 )] Risk for HIV-1 acquisition includes behavioral, biological, or epidemiologic factors including, but not limited to, condomless sex, past or current STIs, self-identified HIV risk, having sexual partners of unknown HIV-1 viremic status, or sexual activity in a high prevalence area or network. Counsel individuals on the use of other prevention measures (e.g., consistent and correct condom use; knowledge of partner(s)’ HIV-1 status, including viral suppression status; regular testing for STIs that can facilitate HIV-1 transmission). Inform individuals about and support their efforts in reducing sexual risk behavior. VOCABRIA for HIV-1 PrEP to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 should be used only in individuals confirmed to be HIV-1 negative [see Contraindications ( . HIV-1 resistance substitutions may emerge in individuals with undiagnosed HIV-1 infection who are taking only VOCABRIA, because VOCABRIA alone does not constitute a complete regimen for HIV-1 treatment 4 )] [see Microbiology ( ; therefore, care should be taken to minimize the risk of initiating or continuing VOCABRIA before confirming the individual is HIV-1 negative. 12.4 )] • Prior to initiating VOCABRIA for HIV-1 PrEP, ask seronegative individuals about recent (in past month) potential exposure events (e.g., condomless sex or condom breaking during sex with a partner of unknown HIV-1 status or unknown viremic status, a recent STI), and evaluate for current or recent signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection (e.g., fever, fatigue, myalgia, skin rash). • If recent (<1 month) exposures to HIV-1 are suspected or clinical symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection are present, use a test approved or cleared by the FDA as an aid in the diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection. Testing should be repeated prior to each injection of APRETUDE and upon diagnosis of any other STIs [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. • If an HIV-1 test indicates possible HIV-1 infection, or if symptoms consistent with acute HIV-1 infection develop following an exposure event, additional HIV testing to determine HIV status is needed. If an individual has confirmed HIV-1 infection, then the individual must be transitioned to a complete HIV-1 treatment regimen. Counsel individuals without HIV-1 to strictly adhere to the recommended dosing schedule for VOCABRIA in order to reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and the potential development of resistance [see Dosage and Administration ( . Some individuals, such as adolescents, may benefit from frequent visits and counseling to support adherence to the dosing schedule 2.2 ), Microbiology ( 12.4 )] [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 ), Microbiology ( 12.4 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] 5.2\tHypersensitivity Reactions Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with cabotegravir and include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [see Adverse Reactions ( . Administration of oral lead-in dosing was used in clinical studies to help identify participants who may be at risk of a hypersensitivity reaction. Remain vigilant and discontinue VOCABRIA if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected 6.2 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ), Contraindications ( 4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] Discontinue VOCABRIA immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash, or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, mucosal involvement [oral blisters or lesions], conjunctivitis, facial edema, hepatitis, eosinophilia, angioedema, difficulty breathing). Clinical status, including liver transaminases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. 5.3\tHepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity has been reported in a limited number of patients receiving cabotegravir with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease or identifiable risk factors [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] When VOCABRIA is Used for Treatment HIV-1 Infection Patients with underlying liver disease or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment with VOCABRIA may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations. Monitoring of liver chemistries is recommended and treatment with VOCABRIA should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity is suspected. When VOCABRIA is Used for HIV-1 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Clinical and laboratory monitoring should be considered and VOCABRIA should be discontinued if hepatotoxicity is suspected, and individuals managed as clinically indicated. 5.4\tDepressive Disorders When VOCABRIA is Used for Treatment HIV-1 Infection Depressive disorders (including depressed mood, depression, mood altered, mood swings, suicidal ideation/suicide attempt) have been reported with VOCABRIA when used with EDURANT for treatment of HIV-1 infection [see Adverse Reactions ( . Promptly evaluate patients with depressive symptoms to assess whether the symptoms are related to VOCABRIA and to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits. 6.1 )] When VOCABRIA is Used for HIV-1 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Depressive disorders (including depression, depressed mood, persistent depressive disorder, suicidal ideation/suicide attempt) have been reported with VOCABRIA [see Adverse Reactions ( . Promptly evaluate individuals with depressive symptoms to assess whether the symptoms are related to VOCABRIA and to determine whether the risks of continued therapy outweigh the benefits. 6.1 )] 5.5\tRisk of Adverse Reactions, Loss of Efficacy, or Reduced Concentration Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of VOCABRIA and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions, some of which may lead to adverse events, loss of efficacy from VOCABRIA when used for treatment of HIV-1 infection or HIV-1 PrEP, and possible development of viral resistance [see Contraindications ( . 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.2 , 7.3 )] See Table 1 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during use of VOCABRIA; review concomitant medications during use of VOCABRIA [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.3 )] 5.6\tRisks Associated with Combination Treatment VOCABRIA is indicated for use in combination with EDURANT (rilpivirine) for treatment of HIV-1 infection [see Indications and Usage ( . Review the prescribing information for EDURANT for information on rilpivirine prior to initiation of VOCABRIA in combination with EDURANT. 1.1 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]",

See full prescribing information for CABENUVA (cabotegravir extended-release injectable suspension; rilpivirine extended-release injectable suspension) for additional safety information. Since VOCABRIA is taken in combination with EDURANT tablets, the prescribing information for EDURANT (rilpivirine) should be consulted for relevant information on rilpivirine. Adverse Reactions of VOCABRIA in Clinical Trials for the Treatment of HIV-1 Infection Clinical Trials Experience in Adults: The safety assessment of VOCABRIA for oral lead-in therapy prior to therapy with CABENUVA is based on the analysis of 48-week data from virologically suppressed participants with HIV-1 infection in 3 international, multicenter, open-label trials, where 590 of 1,182 participants received oral lead-in within the pivotal trials FLAIR and ATLAS (pooled analysis) and 655 of 1,045 participants received oral lead-in within ATLAS-2M [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.1 )] Adverse reactions were reported following exposure to VOCABRIA tablets and EDURANT tablets administered in combination as oral lead-in therapy (median time exposure: 5.3 weeks). Adverse reactions included those attributable to the oral formulation of cabotegravir and rilpivirine administered as a combination regimen. Refer to the prescribing information for EDURANT for other adverse reactions associated with oral rilpivirine. The most common adverse reactions during the oral lead-in period in the pooled analyses of FLAIR and ATLAS at Week 48 were headache, nausea, abnormal dreams, anxiety, and insomnia, all of which occurred in at least 3 participants with an incidence ≤1%. The most common adverse reactions during the oral lead-in period for ATLAS-2M were fatigue, diarrhea, headache, nausea, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, insomnia, and asthenia, all of which occurred in at least 3 participants across both arms, with an incidence ≤2%. During the oral lead-in period for FLAIR and ATLAS, 6 (1%) participants discontinued due to adverse events, including asthenia, myalgia, depression suicidal, and headache. During the oral lead-in period for ATLAS-2M, 4 (<1%) participants discontinued due to adverse events, including asthenia, skin lesion, fatigue, transaminases increased, and depression. In the extension phase of the FLAIR study at Week 124, the overall safety profile was consistent with that observed at Week 48 and when injection therapy with CABENUVA was initiated directly without the oral lead-in phase. Clinical Trial Experience in Adolescents: Based on data from the Week 24 analysis of the MOCHA study in 144 adolescents (aged 12 to younger than 18 years and weighing ≥35 kg), the safety profile of oral cabotegravir and oral rilpivirine administered in combination during the oral lead-in period in adolescents was consistent with the safety profile established with cabotegravir plus rilpivirine in adults. Adverse Reactions of VOCABRIA in Clinical Trials for HIV-1 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Clinical Trial Experience in Adults: In trial HPTN 083, adverse reactions were reported while participants were on blinded study product following exposure to VOCABRIA tablets as oral lead-in for HIV-1 PrEP (median time exposure: 4.1 weeks). The most common adverse reactions reported at ≥1% during the oral lead-in period were diarrhea (4% and 4%), nausea (3% and 5%), dizziness (2% and 2%), headache (2% and 2%), fatigue (1% and 2%), and abnormal dreams (1% and 2%) for VOCABRIA and TRUVADA (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), respectively. During the oral lead-in period, 24 (1%) participants receiving VOCABRIA discontinued due to adverse events, including increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, suicide attempt, and dizziness, which were observed in ≥2 participants. In Trial HPTN 084, adverse reactions were reported while participants were on blinded study product following exposure to VOCABRIA tablets as oral lead-in for HIV-1 PrEP (median time exposure: 4.1 weeks). The most common adverse reactions reported at ≥1% during the oral lead-in period were headache (6% and 7%), nausea (3% and 7%), dizziness (3% and 4%), diarrhea (2% and 4%), upper respiratory tract infection (2% and 2%), somnolence (2% and 1%), fatigue (1% and 2%), abdominal pain (1% and 1%), vomiting (<1% and 3%), decreased appetite (<1% and 2%), and pruritus (<1% and 1%) for VOCABRIA and TRUVADA, respectively. During the oral lead-in period, 4 (<1%) participants receiving VOCABRIA discontinued due to adverse events of increased alanine aminotransferase (n = 3) and sleep disorders (n = 1). Clinical Trials Experience in Adolescents: In adolescents receiving VOCABRIA for HIV-1 PrEP, the safety data were comparable to the safety data reported in adults receiving VOCABRIA for HIV-1 PrEP [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] Less Common Adverse Reactions The following select adverse reactions (regardless of severity) occurred in <1% of participants receiving VOCABRIA in clinical trials for the treatment of HIV-1 infection or for HIV-1 PrEP. Psychiatric Disorders: Suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt (these events were observed primarily in participants with a pre‑existing history of depression or other psychiatric illness). 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of VOCABRIA or cabotegravir-containing regimens. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema and urticaria) [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )]"
