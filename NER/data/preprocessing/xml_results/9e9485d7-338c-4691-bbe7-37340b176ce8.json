    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious Infections : Avoid use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution during an active serious infection, including localized infections. ( 5.1 ) • Gastrointestinal Perforations : Use with caution in patients that may be at increased risk. ( 5.6 ) • Laboratory Monitoring : Recommended due to potential changes in lymphocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, liver enzymes and lipids. ( 5.8 ) • Immunizations : Live vaccines: Avoid use with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving XELJANZ. The most common serious infections reported with XELJANZ included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, urinary tract infection, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus infections, BK virus infection, and listeriosis were reported with XELJANZ. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunomodulating agents such as methotrexate or corticosteroids. In the UC population, XELJANZ treatment with 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of serious infections compared to 5 mg twice daily. Additionally, opportunistic herpes zoster infections (including meningoencephalitis, ophthalmologic, and disseminated cutaneous) were seen in patients who were treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily. Other serious infections that were not reported in clinical studies may also occur (e.g., coccidioidomycosis). Avoid use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients: • with chronic or recurrent infection • who have been exposed to tuberculosis • with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection • who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or • with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. Caution is also recommended in patients with a history of chronic lung disease, or in those who develop interstitial lung disease, as they may be more prone to infections. Risk of infection may be higher with increasing degrees of lymphopenia and consideration should be given to lymphocyte counts when assessing individual patient risk of infection. Discontinuation and monitoring criteria for lymphopenia are recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4) ]. Tuberculosis Patients should be evaluated and tested for latent or active infection prior to and per applicable guidelines during administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should also be considered prior to administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but who have risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis, including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. Patients with latent tuberculosis should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before administering XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. Viral Reactivation Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution. Postmarketing cases of hepatitis B reactivation have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. The impact of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients who screened positive for hepatitis B or C were excluded from clinical trials. Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. The risk of herpes zoster is increased in patients treated with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution and appears to be higher in patients treated with XELJANZ in Japan and Korea. 5.2 Mortality Rheumatoid arthritis patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day or XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day had a higher observed rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, compared to those treated with TNF blockers in a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study (RA Safety Study 1). The incidence rate of all-cause mortality per 100 patient-years was 0.88 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 1.23 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.69 for TNF blockers [see . Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. Clinical Studies (14.6) ] A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA, PsA, or AS [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] For the treatment of UC, use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.3 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders Malignancies, including lymphomas and solid cancers, were observed in clinical studies of XELJANZ [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In RA Safety Study 1, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day or XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day as compared with TNF blockers. The incidence rate of malignancies (excluding NMSC) per 100 patient-years was 1.13 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 1.13 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.77 for TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. Lymphomas and lung cancers, which are a subset of all malignancies in RA Safety Study 1, were observed at a higher rate in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day and XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day compared to those treated with TNF blockers. The incidence rate of lymphomas per 100 patient-years was 0.07 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.11 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.02 for TNF blockers. The incidence rate of lung cancers per 100 patient-years among current and past smokers was 0.48 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.59 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.27 for TNF blockers [see . Clinical Studies (14.6) ] Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy while on treatment, and patients who are current or past smokers. A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] In Phase 2B, controlled dose-ranging trials in de-novo renal transplant patients, all of whom received induction therapy with basiliximab, high-dose corticosteroids, and mycophenolic acid products, Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder was observed in 5 out of 218 patients treated with XELJANZ (2.3%) compared to 0 out of 111 patients treated with cyclosporine. Other malignancies were observed in clinical studies and the postmarketing setting, including, but not limited to, lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) have been reported in patients treated with XELJANZ. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. In the UC population, treatment with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily was associated with greater risk of NMSC. 5.4 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events In RA Safety Study 1, RA patients who were 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily or XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily had a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke, compared to those treated with TNF blockers. The incidence rate of MACE per 100 patient-years was 0.91 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 1.11 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.79 for TNF blockers. The incidence rate of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction per 100 patient-years was 0.36 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.39 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.20 for TNF blockers [see . Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Clinical Studies (14.6) ] Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke. A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA or PsA [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.5 Thrombosis Thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial thrombosis, have occurred in patients treated with XELJANZ and other Janus kinase ( JAK) inhibitors used to treat inflammatory conditions. Many of these events were serious and some resulted in death [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Patients with rheumatoid arthritis 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor treated with XELJANZ at both 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily compared to TNF blockers in RA Safety Study 1 had an observed increase in incidence of these events. The incidence rate of DVT per 100 patient-years was 0.22 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.28 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.16 for TNF blockers. The incidence rate of PE per 100 patient-years was 0.18 for XELJANZ 5 mg twice a day, 0.49 for XELJANZ 10 mg twice a day, and 0.05 for TNF blockers [see . Clinical Studies (14.6) ] A XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 10 mg twice daily (or a XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily) dosage is not recommended for the treatment of RA, PsA, or AS [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] In a long-term extension study in patients with UC, five cases of pulmonary embolism were reported in patients taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, including one death in a patient with advanced cancer. Promptly evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis and discontinue XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients with symptoms of thrombosis. Avoid XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis. For the treatment of UC, use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration needed to achieve/maintain therapeutic response [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.6 Gastrointestinal Perforations Events of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical studies with XELJANZ, although the role of JAK inhibition in these events is not known. In these studies, many patients with rheumatoid arthritis were receiving background therapy with Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). There was no discernable difference in frequency of gastrointestinal perforation between the placebo and the XELJANZ arms in clinical trials of patients with UC, and many of them were receiving background corticosteroids. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis or taking NSAIDs). Patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms should be evaluated promptly for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions such as angioedema and urticaria that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Some events were serious. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue tofacitinib while evaluating the potential cause or causes of the reaction [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.8 Laboratory Abnormalities Lymphocyte Abnormalities Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with initial lymphocytosis at one month of exposure followed by a gradual decrease in mean absolute lymphocyte counts below the baseline of approximately 10% during 12 months of therapy. Lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/mm 3 were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious infections. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution treatment in patients with a low lymphocyte count (i.e., less than 500 cells/mm 3 ). In patients who develop a confirmed absolute lymphocyte count less than 500 cells/mm 3 , treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution is not recommended. Monitor lymphocyte counts at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on lymphocyte counts [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4) ] Neutropenia Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (less than 2000 cells/mm 3 ) compared to placebo. Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution treatment in patients with a low neutrophil count (i.e., ANC less than 1000 cells/mm 3 ). For patients who develop a persistent ANC of 500 to 1000 cells/mm 3 , interrupt XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution dosing until ANC is greater than or equal to 1000 cells/mm 3 . In patients who develop an ANC less than 500 cells/mm 3 , treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution is not recommended. Monitor neutrophil counts at baseline and after 4–8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on ANC results [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ] Anemia Avoid initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution treatment in patients with a low hemoglobin level (i.e., less than 9 g/dL). Treatment with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be interrupted in patients who develop hemoglobin levels less than 8 g/dL or whose hemoglobin level drops greater than 2 g/dL on treatment. Monitor hemoglobin at baseline and after 4–8 weeks of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on hemoglobin results [see . Dosage and Administration (2) ] Liver Enzyme Elevations Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with an increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Most of these abnormalities occurred in studies with background DMARD (primarily methotrexate) therapy. Routine monitoring of liver tests and prompt investigation of the causes of liver enzyme elevations is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If drug-induced liver injury is suspected, the administration of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution should be interrupted until this diagnosis has been excluded. Lipid Elevations Treatment with XELJANZ was associated with dose-dependent increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Maximum effects were generally observed within 6 weeks. There were no clinically relevant changes in LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios. The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 4–8 weeks following initiation of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution therapy. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines [e.g., National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP)] for the management of hyperlipidemia. 5.9 Vaccinations Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of tofacitinib therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents. A patient experienced dissemination of the vaccine strain of varicella zoster virus, 16 days after vaccination with live attenuated (Zostavax) virus vaccine and 2 days after treatment start with tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. The patient was varicella virus naïve, as evidenced by no previous history of varicella infection and no anti-varicella antibodies at baseline. Tofacitinib was discontinued and the patient recovered after treatment with standard doses of antiviral medication. Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution therapy. 5.10 Risk of Gastrointestinal Obstruction with a Non-Deformable Extended-Release Formulation such as XELJANZ XR As with any other non-deformable material, caution should be used when administering XELJANZ XR to patients with pre-existing severe gastrointestinal narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic). There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs utilizing a non-deformable extended-release formulation.",

Rheumatoid Arthritis The clinical studies described in the following sections were conducted using XELJANZ. Although other doses of XELJANZ have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily. The recommended dose for XELJANZ XR is 11 mg once daily. A dosage of XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not a recommended regimen for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [see In RA Safety Study 1, 1455 patients were treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily, 1456 patients were treated with 10 mg twice daily, and 1451 patients were treated with a TNF blocker for a median of 4.0 years Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. [see . Clinical Studies (14.6) ] The following data includes two Phase 2 and five Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials. In these trials, patients were randomized to doses of XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily (292 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (306 patients) monotherapy, XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily (1044 patients) and 10 mg twice daily (1043 patients) in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate) and placebo (809 patients). All seven placebo-controlled protocols included provisions for patients taking placebo to receive treatment with XELJANZ at Month 3 or Month 6 either by patient response (based on uncontrolled disease activity) or by design, so that adverse events cannot always be unambiguously attributed to a given treatment. Therefore, some analyses that follow include patients who changed treatment by design or by patient response from placebo to XELJANZ in both the placebo and XELJANZ group of a given interval. Comparisons between placebo and XELJANZ were based on the first 3 months of exposure, and comparisons between XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily were based on the first 12 months of exposure. The long-term safety population includes all patients who participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (including earlier development phase studies) and then participated in one of two long-term safety studies. The design of the long-term safety studies allowed for modification of XELJANZ doses according to clinical judgment. This limits the interpretation of the long-term safety data with respect to dose. The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the 0 to 3 months exposure in the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was 4% for patients taking XELJANZ and 3% for placebo-treated patients. Overall Infections In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, the overall frequency of infections was 20% and 22% in the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily groups, respectively, and 18% in the placebo group. The most commonly reported infections with XELJANZ were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infections (4%, 3%, and 2% of patients, respectively). Serious Infections In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, serious infections were reported in 1 patient (0.5 events per 100 patient-years) who received placebo and 11 patients (1.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received XELJANZ 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. The rate difference between treatment groups (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 1.1 (-0.4, 2.5) events per 100 patient-years for the combined 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ group minus placebo. In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, serious infections were reported in 34 patients (2.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 33 patients (2.7 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was -0.1 (-1.3, 1.2) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Tuberculosis In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, tuberculosis was not reported in patients who received placebo, 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ, or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, tuberculosis was reported in 0 patients who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 6 patients (0.5 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.5 (0.1, 0.9) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. Cases of disseminated tuberculosis were also reported. The median XELJANZ exposure prior to diagnosis of tuberculosis was 10 months (range from 152 to 960 days) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Opportunistic Infections (excluding tuberculosis) In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, opportunistic infections were not reported in patients who received placebo, 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ, or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, opportunistic infections were reported in 4 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 4 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0 (-0.5, 0.5) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. The median XELJANZ exposure prior to diagnosis of an opportunistic infection was 8 months (range from 41 to 698 days) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Malignancy In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 3 months exposure, malignancies excluding NMSC were reported in 0 patients who received placebo and 2 patients (0.3 events per 100 patient-years) who received either XELJANZ 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily. The rate difference between treatment groups (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.3 (-0.1, 0.7) events per 100 patient-years for the combined 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ group minus placebo. In the seven placebo-controlled trials, during the 0 to 12 months exposure, malignancies excluding NMSC were reported in 5 patients (0.4 events per 100 patient-years) who received 5 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and 7 patients (0.6 events per 100 patient-years) who received 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ. The rate difference between XELJANZ doses (and the corresponding 95% confidence interval) was 0.2 (-0.4, 0.7) events per 100 patient-years for 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ minus 5 mg twice daily XELJANZ. One of these malignancies was a case of lymphoma that occurred during the 0 to 12 month period in a patient treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily. The most common types of malignancy, including malignancies observed during the long-term extension, were lung and breast cancer, followed by gastric, colorectal, renal cell, prostate cancer, lymphoma, and malignant melanoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities Lymphopenia In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, confirmed decreases in absolute lymphocyte counts below 500 cells/mm 3 occurred in 0.04% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ groups combined during the first 3 months of exposure. Confirmed lymphocyte counts less than 500 cells/mm 3 were associated with an increased incidence of treated and serious infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Neutropenia In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, confirmed decreases in ANC below 1000 cells/mm 3 occurred in 0.07% of patients for the 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ groups combined during the first 3 months of exposure. There were no confirmed decreases in ANC below 500 cells/mm 3 observed in any treatment group. There was no clear relationship between neutropenia and the occurrence of serious infections. In the long-term safety population, the pattern and incidence of confirmed decreases in ANC remained consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Liver Enzyme Elevations Confirmed increases in liver enzymes greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (3× ULN) were observed in patients treated with XELJANZ. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of XELJANZ, or reduction in XELJANZ dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes. In the placebo-controlled monotherapy trials (0–3 months), no differences in the incidence of ALT or AST elevations were observed between the placebo, and XELJANZ 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily groups. In the placebo-controlled background DMARD trials (0–3 months), ALT elevations greater than 3× ULN were observed in 1.0%, 1.3% and 1.2% of patients receiving placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. In these trials, AST elevations greater than 3× ULN were observed in 0.6%, 0.5% and 0.4% of patients receiving placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg twice daily, respectively. One case of drug-induced liver injury was reported in a patient treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily for approximately 2.5 months. The patient developed symptomatic elevations of AST and ALT greater than 3× ULN and bilirubin elevations greater than 2× ULN, which required hospitalizations and a liver biopsy. Lipid Elevations In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) were observed at one month of exposure and remained stable thereafter. Changes in lipid parameters during the first 3 months of exposure in the placebo-controlled clinical trials are summarized below: • Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 15% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily arm and 19% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily arm. • Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 10% in the XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily arm and 12% in the XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily arm. • Mean LDL/HDL ratios were essentially unchanged in XELJANZ-treated patients. In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, elevations in LDL cholesterol and ApoB decreased to pretreatment levels in response to statin therapy. In the long-term safety population, elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the placebo-controlled clinical trials. Serum Creatinine Elevations In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, dose-related elevations in serum creatinine were observed with XELJANZ treatment. The mean increase in serum creatinine was <0.1 mg/dL in the 12-month pooled safety analysis; however with increasing duration of exposure in the long-term extensions, up to 2% of patients were discontinued from XELJANZ treatment due to the protocol-specified discontinuation criterion of an increase in creatinine by more than 50% of baseline. The clinical significance of the observed serum creatinine elevations is unknown. Other Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on 5 mg twice daily or 10 mg twice daily XELJANZ and at least 1% greater than that observed in patients on placebo with or without DMARD are summarized in Table 4. Table 4: Common Adverse Reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with either dose of XELJANZ and ≥1% greater than that reported for placebo. in Clinical Trials of XELJANZ for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis With or Without Concomitant DMARDs (0–3 Months) Preferred Term XELJANZ 5 mg Twice Daily XELJANZ 10 mg Twice Daily the recommended dose of XELJANZ for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is 5 mg twice daily [see .

Upper respiratory tract infection 4 4 3 Nasopharyngitis 4 3 3 Diarrhea 4 3 2 Headache 4 3 2 Hypertension 2 2 1 Other adverse reactions occurring in placebo-controlled and open-label extension studies included: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Anemia Infections and infestations: Diverticulitis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Dehydration Psychiatric disorders: Insomnia Nervous system disorders: Paresthesia Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Dyspnea, cough, sinus congestion, interstitial lung disease (cases were limited to patients with rheumatoid arthritis and some were fatal) Gastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastritis, nausea Hepatobiliary disorders: Hepatic steatosis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash, erythema, pruritus Musculoskeletal, connective tissue and bone disorders: Musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia, tendonitis, joint swelling Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps): Non-melanoma skin cancers General disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia, fatigue, peripheral edema Clinical Experience in Methotrexate-Naïve Patients Study RA-VI was an active-controlled clinical trial in methotrexate-naïve patients [see . The safety experience in these patients was consistent with Studies RA-I through V. Clinical Studies (14) ] Psoriatic Arthritis XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and 10 mg twice daily were studied in 2 double-blind Phase 3 clinical trials in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Although other doses of XELJANZ have been studied, the recommended dose of XELJANZ is 5 mg twice daily. The recommended dose for XELJANZ XR is 11 mg once daily. A dosage of XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily or XELJANZ XR 22 mg once daily is not recommended for the treatment of PsA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Study PsA-I (NCT01877668) had a duration of 12 months and enrolled patients who had an inadequate response to a nonbiologic DMARD and who were naïve to treatment with a TNF blocker. Study PsA-I included a 3-month placebo-controlled period and also included adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously once every 2 weeks for 12 months. Study PsA-II (NCT01882439) had a duration of 6 months and enrolled patients who had an inadequate response to at least one approved TNF blocker. This clinical trial included a 3-month placebo-controlled period. In these combined Phase 3 clinical trials, 238 patients were randomized and treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and 236 patients were randomized and treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily. All patients in the clinical trials were required to receive treatment with a stable dose of a nonbiologic DMARD [the majority (79%) received methotrexate]. The study population randomized and treated with XELJANZ (474 patients) included 45 (9.5%) patients aged 65 years or older and 66 (13.9%) patients with diabetes at baseline. During the 2 PsA controlled clinical trials, there were 3 malignancies (excluding NMSC) in 474 patients receiving XELJANZ plus non-biologic DMARD (6 to 12 months exposure) compared with 0 malignancies in 236 patients in the placebo plus non-biologic DMARD group (3 months exposure) and 0 malignancies in 106 patients in the adalimumab plus non-biologic DMARD group (12 months exposure). No lymphomas were reported. Malignancies have also been observed in the long-term extension study in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with XELJANZ. The safety profile observed in patients with active psoriatic arthritis treated with XELJANZ was consistent with the safety profile observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Ankylosing Spondylitis XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily was studied in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in a confirmatory double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial (Study AS-I) and in a dose-ranging Phase 2 clinical trial (Study AS-II). Study AS-I (NCT03502616) had a duration of 48 weeks and enrolled patients who had an inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs. Study AS-I included a 16-week double-blind period in which patients received XELJANZ 5 mg or placebo twice daily and a 32-week open-label treatment period in which all patients received XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily. Study AS-II (NCT01786668) had a duration of 16 weeks and enrolled patients who had an inadequate response to at least 2 NSAIDs. This clinical trial included a 12-week treatment period in which patients received either XELJANZ 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo twice daily. In the combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, a total of 420 patients were treated with either XELJANZ 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg twice daily. Of these, 316 patients were treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily for up to 48 weeks. In the combined double-blind period, 185 patients were randomized to and treated with XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily and 187 to placebo for up to 16 weeks. Concomitant treatment with stable doses of nonbiologic DMARDs, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day) was permitted. The study population randomized and treated with XELJANZ included 13 (3.1%) patients aged 65 years or older and 18 (4.3%) patients with diabetes at baseline. The safety profile observed in patients with AS treated with XELJANZ was consistent with the safety profile observed in RA and PsA patients. Ulcerative Colitis XELJANZ has been studied in patients with moderately to severely active UC in 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (UC-I, UC-II, UC-III, and dose-ranging UC-V) and an open-label long-term extension study (UC-IV) [see . Clinical Studies (14.4) ] Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients treated with either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily of XELJANZ and ≥1% greater than reported in patients receiving placebo in either the induction or maintenance clinical trials were: nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, rash, diarrhea, and herpes zoster. Induction Trials (Study UC-I, UC-II, and UC-V): Common adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients treated with XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily and ≥1% greater than that reported in patients receiving placebo in the 3 induction trials were: headache, nasopharyngitis, elevated cholesterol levels, acne, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, and pyrexia. Maintenance Trial (Study UC-III) Common adverse reactions reported in ≥4% of patients treated with either dose of XELJANZ and ≥1% greater than reported in patients receiving placebo are shown in Table 5.

During the UC controlled clinical studies (8-week induction and 52-week maintenance studies), which included 1220 patients, 0 cases of solid cancer or lymphoma were observed in XELJANZ-treated patients. In the long-term extension study, malignancies (including solid cancers, lymphomas and NMSC) were observed in patients treated with XELJANZ 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily [see . Five cases of pulmonary embolism were reported in patients taking XELJANZ 10 mg twice daily, including one fatality in a patient with advanced cancer Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Polyarticular Course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution 5 mg twice daily or weight-based equivalent twice daily was studied in 225 patients from 2 years to 17 years of age in Study pcJIA-I [see and one open-label extension study. The total patient exposure (defined as patients who received at least one dose of XELJANZ/XELJANZ Oral Solution) was 351 patient-years. Clinical Studies (14.5) ] In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with pcJIA were consistent with those seen in adult RA patients [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune system disorders: Drug hypersensitivity (events such as angioedema and urticaria have been observed) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne"
