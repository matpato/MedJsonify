Based on animal data, miltefosine  may cause fetal harm. [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 4.2 Sjögren-Larsson-Syndrome IMPAVIDO is contraindicated in patients who have Sjögren-Larsson-Syndrome [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.3 )] 4.3 Hypersensitivity IMPAVIDO is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to miltefosine or any IMPAVIDO excipients.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Impaired Semen Quality and Spermatogenesis : Advise male patients that semen quality may be adversely affected after treatment with IMPAVIDO and that effects on spermatogenesis may persist for an unknown duration of time. IMPAVIDO may impair male fertility ( 5.2 , 6.1 , 8.3 ). • Female Reproductive Effects: IMPAVIDO caused impaired fertility in female rats. Advise females of reproductive potential of the reproductive toxicities found in animal studies. The potential effects of IMPAVIDO on female fertility have not been adequately evaluated ( 5.3 , , 13.1 ) • Absorption of Oral Contraceptives: Advise females to use an additional non-oral method of effective contraception if vomiting and/or diarrhea occur ( 5.4 ,). • Renal Effects: Monitor serum creatinine during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy ( 5.5 , 6.1 ). • Hepatic Effects: Monitor transaminases and bilirubin during therapy ( 5.6 , 6.1 ). • Gastrointestinal Effects: Encourage fluid intake ( 5.7 ). • Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count during therapy for visceral leishmaniasis ( 5.8 , 6.1 ). • Stevens-Johnson Syndrome: Discontinue IMPAVIDO ( 5.9 ). • Ocular Complications: Discontinue IMPAVIDO immediately if keratitis, keratopathy, acute scleritis, or anterior uveitis/iritis occur and consult an ophthalmologist ( 5.10 ). 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity IMPAVIDO is contraindicated in patients who are pregnant. Based on animal data, miltefosine may cause fetal harm. Embryo-fetal toxicity, including death and fetal malformations, was observed in animals administered miltefosine prior to mating, during early pregnancy, and during organogenesis at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Verify pregnancy status prior to initiating IMPAVIDO in females of reproductive potential. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMPAVIDO and for 5 months after the last dose [see . Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] 5.2 Impaired Semen Quality and Impaired Spermatogenesis IMPAVIDO may impair male fertility. Reductions in semen parameters (ejaculate volume, total sperm count, sperm concentration, sperm morphology, sperm motility) were observed in a clinical study evaluating the effects of IMPAVIDO on spermatogenesis. For all parameters, except sperm concentration, the observed reductions were reversible in most affected patients and improved within 3 to 6 months. Reductions in sperm concentration of > 50% persisted in up to 26% of patients. Reductions up to the lower limit of normal in sperm concentration (< 20 million/ mL) persisted in up to 8% of patients. Per protocol, semen parameters were not assessed beyond 6 months in any patient. The effect of IMPAVIDO on spermatogenesis may persist for an unknown duration. [see Adverse Reactions ( and 6.1 ) Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.3 )] Reductions in ejaculate volume, temporary absence of ejaculate, and scrotal tenderness were reported in an observational study of male patients who received IMPAVIDO. These adverse reactions resolved in all patients upon completion of IMPAVIDO therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.3 Female Reproductive Effects IMPAVIDO caused impaired fertility in female rats and follicular atresia and reversible anestrus/diestrus in dogs at doses approximately 1.0 and 0.2 times the MRHD based on body surface area comparisons, respectively [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( . The effects of IMPAVIDO on human female fertility have not been formally studied 13.1 )] [see Use in Specific Population ( . 8.3 )] 5.4 Absorption of Oral Contraceptives Vomiting and/or diarrhea occurring during IMPAVIDO therapy may affect the absorption of oral contraceptives, and therefore compromise their efficacy. If vomiting and/or diarrhea occur during IMPAVIDO therapy, advise females to use an additional non-oral method of effective contraception [see . Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] 5.5 Renal Effects Elevations of serum creatinine (Cr) were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of cutaneous, mucosal and visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor renal function weekly in patients receiving IMPAVIDO during therapy and for 4 weeks after end of therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.6 Hepatic Effects Elevations in liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin were noted in clinical trials evaluating IMPAVIDO in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and bilirubin during therapy in patients receiving IMPAVIDO [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.7  Gastrointestinal Effects Vomiting and/or diarrhea commonly occur during IMPAVIDO administration and may result in volume depletion. Encourage fluid intake to avoid volume depletion [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.8 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia during therapy has been reported in patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis. Monitor platelet count during therapy for visceral leishmaniasis [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 , 6.2 )] 5.9  Stevens-Johnson Syndrome Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported during IMPAVIDO therapy. Discontinue IMPAVIDO if an exfoliative or bullous rash is noted during therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.10\tOcular Complications Ocular complications including keratitis, keratopathy, acute scleritis, and anterior uveitis/iritis have been reported in patients treated with IMPAVIDO. Ocular complications of IMPAVIDO therapy have been reported during the treatment of all forms of leishmaniasis (cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral) and during use of IMPAVIDO for conditions other than cutaneous, mucosal and visceral leishmaniasis. Ocular complications are also known to occur in patients with leishmaniasis. Keratitis, keratopathy, acute scleritis, and anterior uveitis/iritis have been reported both within a few days of and after several weeks of IMPAVIDO therapy. While these ocular complications have most commonly been reported in individuals being treated for post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, it is not known whether the higher frequency of reports is due to the particular form of leishmaniasis or the typically longer duration of treatment which occurs with the treatment of postkalaazar dermal leishmaniasis.  The safety and effectiveness of IMPAVIDO in the treatment of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis has not been established. Consideration should be given to having patients receive a baseline eye exam before starting IMPAVIDO. The most commonly reported ocular signs and symptoms after starting IMPAVIDO include: red eye, eye pain, photophobia, increased lacrimation, decreased visual acuity, corneal ulceration, corneal opacities, and partial or complete blindness which in some cases has been permanent. Instruct patients to discontinue IMPAVIDO immediately and follow-up with an ophthalmologist if they develop an ocular adverse reaction while on IMPAVIDO.  Treatment with ocular anti-inflammatory agents may be warranted. If it is determined that significant eye findings occurred as a result of treatment with IMPAVIDO therapy, initiate an alternative anti-leishmanial treatment.  IMPAVIDO has a long half-life [see Clinical Pharmacology ( therefore, it is possible, even with discontinuation of IMPAVIDO therapy, that ocular changes may not resolve. 12.3 )],",

Two-hundred and ninety-nine (299) patients (211 men and 88 women) received oral IMPAVIDO at a target dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days (50 mg capsule once daily if weight was less than 25 kg and 50 mg capsule twice daily if weight was 25 kg or greater).  Patients ranged between 12 and 64 years of age. Weight ranged between 15 and 67 kg (mean weight 38.6 kg) and BMI ranged between 8.2 and 24 (mean 16.1). Ninety-nine (99) patients received 1 mg/kg/day amphotericin B deoxycholate intravenously every other day for 15 doses.  A statistically significant higher percentage of men received IMPAVIDO compared to amphotericin B. Less than 1% of patients who received IMPAVIDO died (2/299) and no patient who received amphotericin B died.  Serious adverse reactions were reported in 2% of IMPAVIDO recipients (6/299) and 1% of amphotericin B recipients (1/99).  Approximately 3% of patients discontinued treatment in each treatment arm due to an adverse reaction.  Serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation that were thought to be related or possibly related to IMPAVIDO included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, melena and thrombocytopenia, arthritis and skin rash, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 4 diarrhea (≥10 stools per day) and CTCAE Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia (≥10x upper limit of normal ULN). Table 2: Treatment Emergent Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥2% of Visceral Leishmaniasis Patients Receiving IMPAVIDO System Organ Class Preferred Term IMPAVIDO N = 299 Amphotericin B Deoxycholate N = 99 Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhea 61 (20.4%) 6 (6.1%) Vomiting 113 (37.8%) 20 (20.0%) General Disorders Asthenia 19 (6.3%) 4 (4.0%) Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased Appetite 69 (23.1%) 22 (22.2%) In this study, creatinine (Cr) elevations ≥ 1.5 times above baseline occurred in approximately 10% of IMPAVIDO recipients and in 40% of amphotericin B recipients at the end of therapy. Ten percent of subjects in each arm had Cr elevations ≥1.5 times above baseline at 6 months follow up. No IMPAVIDO recipient discontinued therapy due to Cr elevation. Elevations of transaminases during therapy occurred in up to half of IMPAVIDO recipients and up to a third of amphotericin B recipients. The elevations were mild (< 3x ULN) or moderate (3-5x ULN) in 94% and 6% respectively of IMPAVIDO-treated patients who experienced an elevation. No patient discontinued therapy due to elevations in transaminases. At the end of therapy, 62% and 2.4% of IMPAVIDO recipients and 54% and 2% of amphotericin B recipients had platelet count < 150,000 and < 50,000 respectively. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis The efficacy of IMPAVIDO in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis was evaluated in one placebo-controlled trial conducted in Colombia and Guatemala and in two comparative trials conducted in Bolivia and Brazil respectively.  In the placebo-controlled trial, eighty-nine (89) patients 12 years of age and older received a target IMPAVIDO dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days and forty-four (44) received placebo.  In the comparative trials, one hundred and twenty (120) patients 12 years of age and older received a target IMPAVIDO dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days and fifty-eight (58) patients received 20 mg/kg/day pentavalent antimony (meglumine) parenterally for 20 days.

In the comparative trial, a similar percentage of subjects who received IMPAVIDO or pentavalent antimony had Cr elevations above baseline at 3 and 6 months after therapy (approximately 5%). Approximately 25% of IMPAVIDO subjects and 11% of pentavalent antimony subjects had Cr elevations 1.5-3 times above baseline at the end of therapy in the two active controlled trials.  The frequency of AST and ALT increase above upper limit of normal at end of therapy was similar in IMPAVIDO and placebo recipients (approximately 5%). Other adverse events seen at <2% incidence in the IMPAVIDO group included anemia, lymphadenopathy, abdominal distension, constipation, dysphagia, flatulence, fatigue, malaise, abscess, cellulitis, ecthyma, paresthesia, testicular pain, testicular swelling, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria, rash, pyoderma. Adverse Effects on Semen Quality and Spermatogenesis In an open-label, uncontrolled, single-center study that assessed the effects of IMPAVIDO on sperm parameters, a total of 58 Bolivian adult males with cutaneous or mucosal leishmaniasis were administered IMPAVIDO for 28 days at a target dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day. Patients underwent repeat semen analysis testing at baseline (prior to treatment), at the end of treatment (Day 25 to 28 of treatment), and at 3 months after completing treatment. If sperm concentrations were markedly reduced at 3 months, per protocol, one additional semen sample was collected at 6 months after completing treatment. The primary safety endpoint was determined at the end of treatment and included the number and percentage of patients with abnormal sperm parameters and clinically relevant changes from baseline in semen volume, total sperm count, sperm concentration, sperm motility and sperm morphology as shown in Table 5. The secondary safety endpoints included: mean changes from baseline in semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, sperm motility and sperm morphology. Mean changes from baseline in serum testosterone and FSH concentrations were also evaluated. A total of 53 patients completed the study. The median patient age was 34 years (range 18 to 51 years). The majority of patients (70.7%) had cutaneous leishmaniasis, while 24.1% had mucosal leishmaniasis, and 5.2% had both forms. Treatment with IMPAVIDO was associated with reductions in all sperm parameters at the end of treatment (see Table 5 ). All sperm parameter reductions, except for sperm concentration, recovered on follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion. For sperm concentration, small mean decreases persisted on follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion, with approximately 26% of subjects showing post-treatment sperm concentrations reductions of ≥ 50%, and 8% showing reductions to the lower limit of normal (< 20 million/ mL), on their last observed assessment. Table 5 shows the results for the primary safety endpoint, the number and percentage of patients with abnormal sperm parameters at the end of treatment and in the post-treatment follow-up period, including assessments at 3 months or 6 months after treatment completion.

Table 6 shows the results for the secondary safety endpoints, mean sperm parameters at baseline, end of treatment, and 3 and 6 months after treatment completion.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports Blood and Lymphatics Disorders : thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis Eye Disorders: keratitis, keratopathy, and acute scleritis; uveitis Gastrointestinal Disorders : melena General Disorders : generalized edema, peripheral edema Hepatobiliary Disorders : jaundice Nervous System Disorders : seizure Vascular Disorders : epistaxis Adverse Reactions from Observational Studies Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : scrotal pain, decreased ejaculate volume, absent ejaculation. Investigations: uric acid elevations Musculoskeletal disorders: acute gout Reduced Ejaculate Volume and Scrotal Tenderness Among 33 young male patients treated with miltefosine at a single Dutch center, 21 (64%) reported diminution of ejaculate volume and 2 (6%) reported temporary absence of ejaculate. In addition, 4 patients (12%) reported scrotal tenderness and 1 (3%) was diagnosed with epididymitis. These adverse reactions resolved in all patients upon completion of their miltefosine therapy."
