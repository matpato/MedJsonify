    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity Reactions: Advise patients to seek immediate medical care ( 5.1 ) • Sulfite Allergic Reactions: RADICAVA and RADICAVA ORS contain sodium bisulfite, which may cause allergic type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and asthmatic episodes in susceptible people ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (redness, wheals, and erythema multiforme) and cases of anaphylaxis (urticaria, decreased blood pressure, and dyspnea) have been reported in spontaneous postmarketing reports with RADICAVA. Patients should be monitored carefully for hypersensitivity reactions. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue RADICAVA and/or RADICAVA ORS, treat per standard of care, and monitor until the condition resolves [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.2 Sulfite Allergic Reactions RADICAVA and RADICAVA ORS contain sodium bisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown. Sulfite sensitivity occurs more frequently in asthmatic than non-asthmatic people.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] • Sulfite Allergic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions (at least 10% of patients treated with RADICAVA and greater than placebo) are contusion, gait disturbance, and headache ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma America, Inc. at 1-888-292-0058 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, 184 patients with ALS were administered RADICAVA 60 mg in treatment cycles for 6 months. The population consisted of Japanese patients who had a median age of 60 years (range 29-75) and were 59% male. Most (93%) of these patients were living independently at the time of screening. Most Common Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Studies Table 2 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of patients in the RADICAVA-treated group and that occurred at least 2% more frequently than in the placebo-treated group in randomized placebo-controlled ALS trials.  The most common adverse reactions that occurred in ≥10% of RADICAVA-treated patients were contusion, gait disturbance, and headache. Table 2: Adverse Reactions from Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials a that Occurred in ≥2% of RADICAVA -Treated Patients and ≥2% More Frequently than in Placebo Patients Adverse Reaction RADICAVA IV (N=184) % Placebo (N=184) % Contusion 15 9 Gait disturbance 13 9 Headache 10 6 Dermatitis 8 5 Eczema 7 4 Respiratory failure, respiratory disorder, hypoxia 6 4 Glycosuria 4 2 Tinea infection 4 2 a Pooled placebo-controlled studies include two additional studies with 231 additional patients, all using the same treatment regimen [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Additional Adverse Reactions with RADICAVA ORS In an open-label study in patients with ALS (n=185) treated with RADICAVA ORS for 6 months, fatigue was observed in 7.6% of patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of RADICAVA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ]."
