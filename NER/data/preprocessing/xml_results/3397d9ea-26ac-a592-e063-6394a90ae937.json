    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fosamprenavir calcium tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with fosamprenavir calcium tablets plus ritonavir in protease inhibitor-experienced patients: The protease inhibitor-experienced patient trial was not large enough to reach a definitive conclusion that fosamprenavir calcium tablets plus ritonavir and lopinavir plus ritonavir are clinically equivalent [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Once-daily administration of fosamprenavir calcium tablets plus ritonavir is not recommended for adult protease inhibitor-experienced patients or any pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3), Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)] . Dosing of fosamprenavir calcium tablets plus ritonavir is not recommended for protease inhibitor-experienced pediatric patients younger than 6 months [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Fosamprenavir calcium tablets are HIV protease inhibitor indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. (1)",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Fosamprenavir calcium is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to any of the components of this product or to amprenavir. Fosamprenavir calcium is contraindicated when coadministered with drugs that are highly dependent on cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events.  These drugs and other contraindicated drugs (which may lead to reduced efficacy of fosamprenavir calcium and possible resistance) are listed below [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The list of contraindicated drugs applies to the use of fosamprenavir calcium with or without ritonavir, unless otherwise indicated. If fosamprenavir calcium is coadministered with ritonavir, reference should be made to the full prescribing information for ritonavir for additional contraindications. Fosamprenavir calcium is contraindicated when coadministered with the following drugs: Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: Alfuzosin Antiarrhythmics: Flecainide (with ritonavir ), propafenone (with ritonavir ) Antimycobacterial: Rifampin Antipsychotic: Lurasidone (with ritonavir ), pimozide Ergot derivatives: Dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine GI motility agent: Cisapride Herbal product: St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Lipid modifying agents: Lomitapide, lovastatin, simvastatin Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor: Delavirdine PDE5 inhibitor: Sildenafil (Revatio) (for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension) Sedative/hypnotics: Midazolam, triazolam Hypersensitivity to fosamprenavir calcium or amprenavir (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The concomitant use of fosamprenavir calcium with ritonavir and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. (5.1, 7.3) Fosamprenavir calcium should be discontinued for severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. (5.2) Fosamprenavir calcium should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. (5.3) Use of higher-than-approved doses may lead to transaminase elevations. Patients with hepatitis B or C are at increased risk of transaminase elevations. (5.4) Patients receiving fosamprenavir calcium may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia (5.5), immune reconstitution syndrome (5.6), increase of body fat (5.7), and elevated triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations (5.8). Monitor cholesterol and triglycerides prior to therapy and periodically thereafter. Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported with amprenavir. (5.9) Hemophilia: Spontaneous bleeding may occur, and additional factor VIII may be required. (5.10) Nephrolithiasis: Cases of nephrolithiasis have been reported with fosamprenavir. (5.11) 5.1 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A, or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to: clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications. clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir. loss of therapeutic effect of fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir and possible development of resistance. See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir; review concomitant medications during therapy with fosamprenavir calcium/ritonavir, and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.2 Skin Reactions Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including 1 case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome among 700 subjects treated with fosamprenavir calcium in clinical trials. Treatment with fosamprenavir calcium should be discontinued for severe or life-threatening rashes and for moderate rashes accompanied by systemic symptoms [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . 5.3 Sulfa Allergy Fosamprenavir calcium should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. Fosamprenavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. The potential for cross-sensitivity between drugs in the sulfonamide class and fosamprenavir is unknown. In a clinical trial of fosamprenavir calcium used as the sole protease inhibitor, rash occurred in 2 of 10 subjects (20%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 42 of 126 subjects (33%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy. In 2 clinical trials of fosamprenavir calcium plus low-dose ritonavir, rash occurred in 8 of 50 subjects (16%) with a history of sulfonamide allergy compared with 50 of 412 subjects (12%) with no history of sulfonamide allergy. 5.4 Hepatic Toxicity Use of fosamprenavir calcium with ritonavir at higher-than-recommended dosages may result in transaminase elevations and should not be used [see Dosage and Administration (2), Overdosage (10)] . Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening of transaminase elevations. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with fosamprenavir calcium and patients should be monitored closely during treatment. 5.5 Diabetes/Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-1-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between protease inhibitor therapy and these events have not been established. 5.6 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including fosamprenavir calcium. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.7 Increase in Body Fat Increase of body fat has been observed in patients receiving protease inhibitors, including fosamprenavir calcium. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.8 Lipid Elevations Treatment with fosamprenavir calcium plus ritonavir has resulted in increases in the concentration of triglycerides and cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating therapy with fosamprenavir calcium and at periodic intervals during therapy. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.9 Hemolytic Anemia Acute hemolytic anemia has been reported in a patient treated with amprenavir. 5.10 Patients with Hemophilia There have been reports of spontaneous bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and B treated with protease inhibitors. In some patients, additional factor VIII was required. In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted. A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established. 5.11 Nephrolithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis were reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV-1-infected patients receiving fosamprenavir calcium. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made. If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis occur, temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered. 5.12 Resistance/Cross-Resistance Because the potential for HIV cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored, it is unknown what effect therapy with fosamprenavir calcium will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors. Fosamprenavir calcium has been studied in patients who have experienced treatment failure with protease inhibitors [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] .",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been reported with the use of fosamprenavir calcium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The most common moderate to severe adverse reactions in clinical trials of fosamprenavir calcium were diarrhea, rash, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 6.4% of subjects receiving fosamprenavir calcium and in 5.9% of subjects receiving comparator treatments. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of fosamprenavir calcium (incidence less than or equal to 1% of subjects) included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, AST increased, ALT increased, and rash. In adults the most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 4%) are diarrhea, rash, nausea, vomiting, and headache. (6.1) Vomiting and neutropenia were more frequent in pediatrics than in adults.

Adult Trials The data for the 3 active-controlled clinical trials described below reflect exposure of 700 HIV-1-infected subjects to fosamprenavir calcium tablets, including 599 subjects exposed to fosamprenavir calcium for greater than 24 weeks, and 409 subjects exposed for greater than 48 weeks. The population age ranged from 17 to 72 years. Of these subjects, 26% were female, 51% white, 31% black, 16% American Hispanic, and 70% were antiretroviral-naive. Sixty-one percent received fosamprenavir calcium 1,400 mg once daily plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily; 24% received fosamprenavir calcium 1,400 mg twice daily; and 15% received fosamprenavir calcium 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Selected adverse reactions reported during the clinical efficacy trials of fosamprenavir calcium are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Each table presents adverse reactions of moderate or severe intensity in subjects treated with combination therapy for up to 48 weeks. Table 2.

Skin rash (without regard to causality) occurred in approximately 19% of subjects treated with fosamprenavir calcium in the pivotal efficacy trials. Rashes were usually maculopapular and of mild or moderate intensity, some with pruritus. Rash had a median onset of 11 days after initiation of fosamprenavir calcium and had a median duration of 13 days. Skin rash led to discontinuation of fosamprenavir calcium in less than 1% of subjects. In some subjects with mild or moderate rash, dosing with fosamprenavir calcium was often continued without interruption; if interrupted, reintroduction of fosamprenavir calcium generally did not result in rash recurrence. The percentages of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the clinical efficacy trials of fosamprenavir calcium are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4.

Pediatric Trials Fosamprenavir calcium with and without ritonavir was studied in 237 HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects aged at least 4 weeks to 18 years in 3 open-label trials; APV20002, APV20003, and APV29005 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] . Vomiting and neutropenia occurred more frequently in pediatric subjects compared with adults. Other adverse events occurred with similar frequency in pediatric subjects compared with adults. The frequency of vomiting among pediatric subjects receiving fosamprenavir calcium twice daily with ritonavir was 20% in subjects aged at least 4 weeks to younger than 2 years and 36% in subjects aged 2 to 18 years compared with 10% in adults. The frequency of vomiting among pediatric subjects receiving fosamprenavir calcium twice daily without ritonavir was 60% in subjects aged 2 to 5 years compared with 16% in adults. The median duration of drug-related vomiting episodes in APV29005 was 1 day (range: 1 to 3 days), in APV20003 was 16 days (range: 1 to 38 days), and in APV20002 was 9 days (range: 4 to 13 days). Vomiting was treatment limiting in 4 pediatric subjects across all 3 trials. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (neutrophils less than 750 cells per mm 3 ) seen in pediatric subjects treated with fosamprenavir calcium with and without ritonavir was higher (15%) than the incidence seen in adult subjects (3%). Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 10% (5 of 51) of subjects aged at least 4 weeks to younger than 2 years and 16% (28 of 170) of subjects aged 2 to 18 years. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of fosamprenavir calcium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to fosamprenavir calcium. Cardiac Disorders Myocardial infarction. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hypercholesterolemia. Nervous System Disorders Oral paresthesia. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema. Urogenital Nephrolithiasis."
