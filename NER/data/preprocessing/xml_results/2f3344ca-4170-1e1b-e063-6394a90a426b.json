  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Montelukast sodium tablets are a leukotriene receptor antagonist indicated for: • Prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in patients 15 years of age and older ( 1.1 ) . • Acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) in patients 15 years of age and older ( 1.2 ) . • Relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis ( AR ) : seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) in patients 15 years of age and older, and perennial allergic rhinitis ( PAR ) in patients 15 years of age and older. Reserve use for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies ( 1.3 ) . Limitations of Use: • Not indicated to treat an acute asthma attack ( 5.2 ) . 1.1 Asthma Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older. 1.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction ( EIB ) in patients 15 years of age and older. 1.3 Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodiumtablets are indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 15 yearsof age and older. Because the benefits of montelukast sodium tablets may not outweigh the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis [see Warnings and Precautions reserve use for patients who have an inadequate response orintolerance to alternative therapies. ( 5.1 ) ] , 1.4 Limitations of Use Montelukastsodium tablets are not indicated for the treatment of an acute asthma attack.",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Montelukast sodium tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components. Hypersensitivity to any component of montelukast sodium tablets ( 4 ) .",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Do not prescribe montelukast sodium to treat an acute asthma attack ( 5.2 ) . • Advise patients to have appropriate rescue medication available ( 5.2 ) . • Inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually. Do not abruptly substitute montelukast sodium for inhaled or oral corticosteroids ( 5.3 ) . • Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue to avoid aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium ( 5.4 ) . • Systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, has been reported. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy ( 5.5 and 6.2 ) . 5.1 Neuropsychiatric Events Serious neuropsychiatric ( NP ) events have been reported with use of montelukast sodium. These postmarketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation,aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities,dysphemia ( stuttering ) , hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness,somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior ( including suicide ) , tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without aprevioushistory of psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported aftermontelukastsodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats [see Clinical Pharmacology however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NPeventsare currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify riskfactorsfor or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use. ( 12.3 ) ] ; Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may bemildand adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequateresponseor intolerance to alternative therapies [see Indications and Usage In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits andrisksbefore prescribing montelukast sodium. ( 1.3 ) ] . Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to bealertfor changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughtsand/orbehavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. In many cases, symptomsresolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore,continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment withmontelukastsodium if such events occur. 5.2 Acute Asthma Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. 5.3 Concomitant Corticosteroid Use While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. 5.4 Aspirin Sensitivity Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . 5.5 Eosinophilic Conditions Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] .",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: • Neuropsychiatric Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo listed in descending order of frequency ) : upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis ( 6.1 ) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Quallent Pharmaceuticals Health LLC at 1-877-605-7243 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency ) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions reported with montelukast sodium occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo: Table 5: Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥1% of Patients with an Incidence Greater than that in Patients Treated with Placebo Montelukast sodium 10 mg/day ( % ) ( n=1955 ) Placebo ( % ) ( n=1180 ) Body As A Whole Pain, abdominal Asthenia/fatigue Fever 2.9 1.8 1.5 2.5 1.2 0.9 Trauma Digestive System Disorders Dyspepsia 1.0 2.1 0.8 1.1 Pain, dental 1.7 1.0 Gastroenteritis, infectious 1.5 0.5 Nervous System/Psychiatric Headache 18.4 18.1 Dizziness 1.9 1.4 Respiratory System Disorders Influenza 4.2 3.9 Cough 2.7 2.4 Congestion, nasal 1.6 1.3 Skin/Skin Appendages Disorder Rash 1.6 1.2 Laboratory Adverse Reactions * ALT increased 2.1 2.0 AST increased 1.6 1.2 Pyuria 1.0 0.9 * Number of patients tested ( montelukast sodium and placebo, respectively ) : ALT and AST, 1935, 1170; pyuria, 1924, 1159. The frequency of less common adverse reactions was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse reaction profile did not significantly change. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following reaction was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following reactions were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia Immune system disorders hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration Psychiatric disorders including, but not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia ( stuttering ) , hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior ( including suicide ) , tic, and tremor [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Nervous system disorders drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures Cardiac disorders palpitations Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia Gastrointestinal disorders diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting Hepatobiliary disorders Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps Renal and urinary disorders enuresis in children General disorders and administration site conditions edema Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These reactions have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] ."
