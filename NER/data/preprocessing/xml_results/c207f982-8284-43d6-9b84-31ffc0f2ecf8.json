    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (reported in ≥20% of patients) is injection site reactions. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alnylam Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-256-9526 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of OXLUMO has been evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial and two single-arm clinical trials. Across these trials, 98 patients with PH1 have been treated with OXLUMO, including 71 pediatric patients and 15 patients on hemodialysis. Overall, 92 patients were treated for at least 6 months, 78 patients for at least 12 months, and 29 patients for at least 24 months. In the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study ILLUMINATE-A in pediatric and adult patients with PH1 aged 6 to 61 years, 26 patients received OXLUMO, and 13 patients received placebo. Of these, 25 patients received ≥5 months of treatment. In two single-arm studies in patients with PH1, ILLUMINATE-B (patients <6 years of age) and ILLUMINATE-C (pediatric and adult patients with moderately or severely reduced GFR [eGFR ≤45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or pediatric patients <12 months of age with serum creatinine above the upper limit of normal for age] and patients with kidney failure on hemodialysis), the OXLUMO safety profile was similar to that seen in ILLUMINATE-A [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] In placebo-controlled and open-label clinical studies the most common adverse reaction reported was injection site reaction. Injection site reactions included erythema, swelling, pain, hematoma, pruritus, and discoloration. These symptoms were generally mild and resolved within one day of the injection and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in at Least 10% of Patients Treated with OXLUMO and that Occurred at Least 5% More Frequently than in Patients Treated with Placebo in ILLUMINATE-A during the 6-Month Double-Blind Period Adverse Reaction OXLUMO N=26 N (%) Placebo N=13 N (%) Injection site reaction 10 (38) 0 (0) Abdominal pain Grouped term includes abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain lower, and abdominal discomfort. 4 (15) 1 (8) 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reaction has been reported during post-approval use. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Immune system disorder: Hypersensitivity"
