    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Bumetanide tablets are indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. Almost equal diuretic response occurs after oral and parenteral administration of bumetanide. Therefore, if impaired gastrointestinal absorption is suspected or oral administration is not practical, bumetanide should be given by the intramuscular or intravenous route. Successful treatment with bumetanide tablets following instances of allergic reactions to furosemide suggests a lack of cross-sensitivity.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Bumetanide is contraindicated in anuria. Although bumetanide can be used to induce diuresis in renal insufficiency, any marked increase in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, or the development of oliguria during therapy of patients with progressive renal disease, is an indication for discontinuation of treatment with bumetanide. Bumetanide is also contraindicated in patients in hepatic coma or in states of severe electrolyte depletion until the condition is improved or corrected. Bumetanide is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to this drug.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Click here to enter Warnings Volume and Electrolyte Depletion The dose of bumetanide should be adjusted to the patient's need. Excessive doses or too frequent administration can lead to profound water loss, electrolyte depletion, dehydration, reduction in blood volume and circulatory collapse with the possibility of vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients. Hypokalemia Hypokalemia can occur as a consequence of bumetanide administration. Prevention of hypokalemia requires particular attention in the following conditions: patients receiving digitalis and diuretics for congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, states of aldosterone excess with normal renal function, potassium-losing nephropathy, certain diarrheal states, or other states where hypokalemia is thought to represent particular added risks to the patient, i.e., history of ventricular arrhythmias. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites, sudden alterations of electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy and coma. Treatment in such patients is best initiated in the hospital with small doses and careful monitoring of the patient's clinical status and electrolyte balance. Supplemental potassium and/or spironolactone may prevent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis in these patients. Ototoxicity In cats, dogs and guinea pigs, bumetanide has been shown to produce ototoxicity. In these test animals bumetanide was 5 to 6 times more potent than furosemide and, since the diuretic potency of bumetanide is about 40 to 60 times furosemide, it is anticipated that blood levels necessary to produce ototoxicity will rarely be achieved. The potential exists, however, and must be considered a risk of intravenous therapy, especially at high doses, repeated frequently in the face of renal excretory function impairment Potentiation of aminoglycoside ototoxicity has not been tested for bumetanide. Like other members of this class of diuretics, bumetanide probably shares this risk. Allergy to Sulfonamides Patients allergic to sulfonamides may show hypersensitivity to bumetanide. Thrombocytopenia Since there have been rare spontaneous reports of thrombocytopenia from post marketing experience, patients should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of thrombocytopenia.PRECAUTIONS Click here to enter Precautions General Serum potassium should be measured periodically and potassium supplements or potassium sparing diuretics added if necessary. Periodic determinations of other electrolytes are advised in patients treated with high doses or for prolonged periods, particularly in those on low-salt diets. Hyperuricemia may occur; it has been asymptomatic in cases reported to date. Reversible elevations of the BUN and creatinine may also occur, especially in association with dehydration and particularly in patients with renal insufficiency. Bumetanide may increase urinary calcium excretion with resultant hypocalcemia. Diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia. Laboratory Tests Studies in normal subjects receiving bumetanide revealed no adverse effects on glucose tolerance, plasma insulin, glucagon and growth hormone levels, but the possibility of an effect on glucose metabolism exists. Periodic determinations of blood sugar should be done, particularly in patients with diabetes or suspected latent diabetes. Patients under treatment should be observed regularly for possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver damage or idiosyncratic reactions, which have been reported occasionally in foreign marketing experience. The relationship of these occurrences to bumetanide use is not certain. Drug Interactions Drugs with Ototoxic Potential ( see ) WARNINGS . Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered bumetanide in patients to whom aminoglycoside antibiotics are also being given should be avoided, except in life- threatening conditions. Drugs with Nephrotoxic Potential There has been no experience with the concurrent use of bumetanide with drugs known to have a nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, the simultaneous administration of these drugs should be avoided. Lithium Lithium should generally not be given with diuretics (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Probenecid Pretreatment with probenecid reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by bumetanide. This antagonistic effect of probenecid on bumetanide natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide. Thus, probenecid should not be administered concurrently with bumetanide. Indomethacin Indomethacin blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during bumetanide treatment and inhibits the bumetanide-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Concurrent therapy with bumetanide is thus not recommended. Antihypertensives Bumetanide may potentiate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs. Digoxin Interaction studies in humans have shown no effect on digoxin blood levels. Anticoagulants Interaction studies in humans have shown bumetanide to have no effect on warfarin metabolism or on plasma prothrombin activity. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Bumetanide was devoid of mutagenic activity in various strains of Salmonella typhimurium when tested in the presence or absence of an in vitro metabolic activation system. An 18- month study showed an increase in mammary adenomas of questionable significance in female rats receiving oral doses of 60 mg/kg/day (2,000 times a 2-mg human dose). A repeat study at the same doses failed to duplicate this finding. Reproduction studies were performed to evaluate general reproductive performance and fertility in rats at oral dose levels of 10, 30, 60 or 100 mg/kg/day. The pregnancy rate was slightly decreased in the treated animals; however, the differences were small and not statistically significant. Pregnancy Click here to enter Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. As a general rule, nursing should not be undertaken while the patient is on bumetanide since it may be excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established. In vitro studies using pooled sera from critically ill neonates have shown bumetanide to be a potent displacer of bilirubin (see ). The administration of bumetanide could present a particular concern if given to critically ill or jaundiced neonates at risk for kernicterus. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pediatric Pharmacology Geriatric Use Clinical studies of bumetanide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent clinical adverse reactions considered probably or possibly related to bumetanide are muscle cramps (seen in 1.1% of treated patients), dizziness (1.1%), hypotension (0.8%), headache (0.6%), nausea (0.6%) and encephalopathy (in patients with pre-existing liver disease) (0.6%).
