    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intrathecal administration of GBCAs can cause serious adverse reactions including death, coma, encephalopathy, and seizures. The safety and effectiveness of Gadavist have not been established with intrathecal use. Gadavist is not approved for intrathecal use [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. • Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions with cardiovascular, respiratory or cutaneous manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, including death, have occurred. Monitor patients closely during and after administration of Gadavist. ( 5.3 ) • Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: For patients demonstrating respiratory distress after administration, assess oxygen requirement and monitor for worsening respiratory function. (5.4) • Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in brain, bone, and other organs. (5.5) 5.2 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of Gadavist among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast  MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following Gadavist administration to Bayer Healthcare (1-888-842-2937) or FDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch ). Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example, age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing. Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Gadavist dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent’s elimination [see Use in Specific Populations ( The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic and other hypersensitivity reactions with cardiovascular, respiratory or cutaneous manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, including death, have uncommonly occurred following Gadavist administration [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6 )] • Before Gadavist administration, assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media, bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Gadavist. • Administer Gadavist only in situations where trained personnel and therapies are promptly available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, including personnel trained in resuscitation. Most hypersensitivity reactions to Gadavist have occurred within half an hour after administration. Delayed reactions can occur up to several days after administration. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions during and following Gadavist administration. 5.4 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients administered GADAVIST and may be characterized by severe hypoxemia requiring oxygen support and mechanical ventilation. These manifestations may resemble an immediate hypersensitivity reaction with onset of respiratory distress within <30 minutes to 24 hours after GADAVIST administration. For patients demonstrating respiratory distress after GADAVIST administration, assess oxygen requirement and monitor for worsening respiratory function. 5.5 Gadolinium Retention Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. The highest concentrations (nanomoles per gram of tissue) have been identified in the bone, followed by other organs (for example, brain, skin, kidney, liver, and spleen). The duration of retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. At equivalent doses, gadolinium retention varies among the linear agents with Omniscan (gadodiamide) and Optimark (gadoversetamide) causing greater retention than other linear agents [Eovist (gadoxetate disodium), Magnevist (gadopentetate dimeglumine), MultiHance (gadobenate dimeglumine)]. Retention is lowest and similar among the macrocyclic GBCAs [Dotarem (gadoterate meglumine), Gadavist (gadobutrol), ProHance (gadoteridol)]. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function [see Warnings and Precautions ( . There are rare reports of pathologic skin changes in patients with normal renal function. Adverse events involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium retention )] 5.2 [see Adverse Reactions ( . )] 6.2 While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function, certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses, pregnant and pediatric patients, and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies particularly closely spaced studies, when possible. 5.6 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with chronic renal impairment, acute kidney injury sometimes requiring dialysis has been observed with the use of some GBCAs. Do not exceed the recommended dose; the risk of acute kidney injury may increase with higher than recommended doses. 5.7 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of Gadavist. Extravasation into tissues during Gadavist administration may result in moderate irritation [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( . 13.2 )] 5.8 Overestimation of Extent of Malignant Disease in MRI of the Breast Gadavist MRI of the breast overestimated the histologically confirmed extent of malignancy in the diseased breast in up to 50% of the patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. 5.9 Low Sensitivity for Significant Arterial Stenosis The performance of Gadavist MRA for detecting arterial segments with significant stenosis (>50% renal, >70% supra-aortic) has not been shown to exceed 55%. Therefore, a negative MRA study alone should not be used to rule out significant stenosis [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )].",

The adverse reactions described in this section reflect Gadavist exposure in 7,713 subjects (including 184 pediatric patients, ages 0 to 17 years) with the majority receiving the recommended dose. Approximately 52% of the subjects were male and the ethnic distribution was 62% Caucasian, 28% Asian, 5% Hispanic, 2.5% Black, and 2.5% patients of other ethnic groups. The average age was 56 years (range from 1 week to 93 years). Overall, approximately 4% of subjects reported one or more adverse reactions during a follow-up period that ranged from 24 hours to 7 days after Gadavist administration. Adverse reactions associated with the use of Gadavist were usually mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 0.1% subjects who received Gadavist.
