    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are indicated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and symptomatic parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are contraindicated for use with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. These inhibitors must be discontinued at least two weeks prior to initiating therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release may be administered concomitantly with the manufacturer's recommended dose of an MAO inhibitor with selectivity for MAO type B (e.g., selegiline HCl) (see ). PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of this drug, and in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS When patients are receiving levodopa without a decarboxylase inhibitor, levodopa must be discontinued at least twelve hours before carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is started. In order to reduce adverse reactions, it is necessary to individualize therapy. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section before initiating therapy. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release should be substituted at a dosage that will provide approximately 25% of the previous levodopa dosage (see ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Carbidopa does not decrease adverse reactions due to central effects of levodopa. By permitting more levodopa to reach the brain, particularly when nausea and vomiting is not a dose-limiting factor, certain adverse central nervous system (CNS) effects, e.g., dyskinesias, will occur at lower dosages and sooner during therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release than with levodopa alone. Patients receiving carbidopa and levodopa extended-release may develop increased dyskinesias compared to carbidopa and levodopa. Dyskinesias are a common side effect of carbidopa-levodopa treatment. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. All patients should be observed carefully for the development of depression with concomitant suicidal tendencies. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release should be administered cautiously to patients with severe cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease. As with levodopa, care should be exercised in administering carbidopa and levodopa extended-release to patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have residual atrial, nodal, or ventricular arrhythmias. In such patients, cardiac function should be monitored with particular care during the period of initial dosage adjustment, in a facility with provisions for intensive cardiac care. As with levodopa, treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release may increase the possibility of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with a history of peptic ulcer. Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence Patients taking carbidopa and levodopa extended-release alone or with other dopaminergic drugs have reported suddenly falling asleep without prior warning of sleepiness while engaged in activities of daily living (includes operation of motor vehicles). Road traffic accidents attributed to sudden sleep onset have been reported. Although many patients reported somnolence while on dopaminergic medications, there have been reports of road traffic accidents attributed to sudden onset of sleep in which the patient did not perceive any warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Sudden onset of sleep has been reported to occur as long as one year after the initiation of treatment. Falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living usually occurs in patients experiencing preexisting somnolence, although some patients may not give such a history. For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment. Prescribers should be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities. Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machines during treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Patients who have already experienced somnolence or an episode of sudden sleep onset should not participate in these activities during treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Before initiating treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, advise patients about the potential to develop drowsiness and ask specifically about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release such as the use of concomitant sedating medications and the presence of sleep disorders. Consider discontinuing carbidopa and levodopa extended-release in patients who report significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.). If treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release continues, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent. There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living. Hyperpyrexia and Confusion Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reductions or withdrawal of certain antiparkinsonian agents such as levodopa, carbidopa levodopa and carbidopa levodopa extended release. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics. NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia. Neurological findings, including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes; other disturbances, such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin have been reported. The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene, are often used in the treatment of NMS; however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.PRECAUTIONS General As with levodopa, periodic evaluations of hepatic, hematopoietic, cardiovascular, and renal function are recommended during extended therapy. Patients with chronic wide-angle glaucoma may be treated cautiously with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release provided the intraocular pressure is well-controlled and the patient is monitored carefully for changes in intraocular pressure during therapy. Dyskinesia Levodopa alone, as well as carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, is associated with dyskinesias. The occurrence of dyskinesias may require dosage reduction. Hallucinations / Psychotic-Like Behavior Hallucinations and psychotic-like behavior have been reported with dopaminergic medications. In general, hallucinations present shortly after the initiation of therapy and may be responsive to dose reduction in levodopa. Hallucinations may be accompanied by confusion and to a lesser extent sleep disorder (insomnia) and excessive dreaming. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release may have similar effects on thinking and behavior. This abnormal thinking and behavior may present with one or more symptoms, including paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, psychotic-like behavior, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium. Ordinarily, patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis. In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinsonâ€™s disease and may decrease the effectiveness of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Impulse Control / Compulsive Behaviors Reports of patients taking dopaminergic medications (medications that increase central dopaminergic tone), suggest that patients may experience an intense urge to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges. In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or the caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking carbidopa and levodopa extended-release [see Information for Patients]. Melanoma Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population. Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear. For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using carbidopa and levodopa extended-release for any indication. Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists). Information for Patients The patient should be informed that carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets are an extended-release formulation of carbidopa levodopa which releases these ingredients over a 4- to 6-hour period. It is important that carbidopa and levodopa extended-release be taken at regular intervals according to the schedule outlined by the physician. The patient should be cautioned not to change the prescribed dosage regimen and not to add any additional antiparkinson medications, including other carbidopa levodopa preparations, without first consulting the physician. If abnormal involuntary movements appear or get worse during treatment with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release, the physician should be notified, as dosage adjustment may be necessary. Patients should be advised that sometimes the onset of effect of the first morning dose of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release may be delayed for up to 1 hour compared with the response usually obtained from the first morning dose of carbidopa and levodopa. The physician should be notified if such delayed responses pose a problem in treatment. Patients should be advised that, occasionally, dark color (red, brown, or black) may appear in saliva, urine, or sweat after ingestion of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets. Although the color appears to be clinically insignificant, garments may become discolored. The patient should be informed that a change in diet to foods that are high in protein may delay the absorption of levodopa and may reduce the amount taken up in the circulation. Excessive acidity also delays stomach emptying, thus delaying the absorption of levodopa. Iron salts (such as in multivitamin tablets) may also reduce the amount of levodopa available to the body. The above factors may reduce the clinical effectiveness of the levodopa or carbidopa levodopa therapy. Patients must be advised that the whole or half tablet should be swallowed without chewing or crushing. Patients should be alerted to the possibility of sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, when they are taking dopaminergic agents, including levodopa. Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving or operating machinery and that if they have experienced somnolence and/or sudden sleep onset, they must refrain from these activities. (See WARNINGS, Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence) There have been reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, and other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, including carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Although it is not proven that the medications caused these events, these urges were reported to have stopped in some cases when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped. Prescribers should ask patients about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges or other urges while being treated with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Patients should inform their physician if they experience new or increased gambling urges, increased sexual urges, or other intense urges while taking carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking carbidopa and levodopa extended-release (See PRECAUTIONS, Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors) Laboratory Tests Abnormalities in laboratory tests may include elevations of liver function tests such as alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and bilirubin. Abnormalities in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and positive Coombs test have also been reported. Commonly, levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and uric acid are lower during administration of carbidopa levodopa preparations than with levodopa. Carbidopa levodopa preparations, such as carbidopa and levodopa and carbidopa and levodopa extended-release may cause a false-positive reaction for urinary ketone bodies when a test tape is used for determination of ketonuria. This reaction will not be altered by boiling the urine specimen. False-negative tests may result with the use of glucose-oxidase methods of testing for glucosuria. Cases of falsely diagnosed pheochromocytoma in patients on carbidopa levodopa therapy have been reported very rarely. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the plasma and urine levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in patients on levodopa or carbidopa levodopa therapy. Drug Interactions Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. Symptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when carbidopa levodopa preparations were added to the treatment of patients receiving some antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, when therapy with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be required. For patients receiving MAO inhibitors (Type A or B), see . Concomitant therapy with selegiline and carbidopa levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to carbidopa levodopa alone (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). CONTRAINDICATIONS There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and carbidopa levodopa preparations. Dopamine D 2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these drugs with carbidopa and levodopa extended-release should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response. Use of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release with dopamine-depleting agents (e.g., reserpine and tetrabenazine) or other drugs known to deplete monoamine stores is not recommended. Carbidopa and levodopa extended-release and iron salts or multivitamins containing iron salts should be coadministered with caution. Iron salts can form chelates with levodopa and carbidopa and consequently reduce the bioavailability of carbidopa and levodopa. Although metoclopramide may increase the bioavailability of levodopa by increasing gastric emptying, metoclopramide may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic properties. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a two-year bioassay of carbidopa and levodopa, no evidence of carcinogenicity was found in rats receiving doses of approximately two times the maximum daily human dose of carbidopa and four times the maximum daily human dose of levodopa (equivalent to 8 carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets). In reproduction studies with carbidopa and levodopa, no effects on fertility were found in rats receiving doses of approximately two times the maximum daily human dose of carbidopa and four times the maximum daily human dose of levodopa (equivalent to 8 carbidopa and levodopa extended-release tablets). Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C. No teratogenic effects were observed in a study in mice receiving up to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa and levodopa. There was a decrease in the number of live pups delivered by rats receiving approximately two times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa and approximately five times the maximum recommended human dose of levodopa during organogenesis. Carbidopa and levodopa caused both visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits at all doses and ratios of carbidopa/levodopa tested, which ranged from 10 times/5 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa/levodopa to 20 times/10 times the maximum recommended human dose of carbidopa/levodopa. There are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. It has been reported from individual cases that levodopa crosses the human placental barrier, enters the fetus, and is metabolized. Carbidopa concentrations in fetal tissue appeared to be minimal. Use of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the drug be weighed against possible hazards to mother and child. Nursing Mothers Levodopa has been detected in human milk. Caution should be exercised when carbidopa and levodopa extended-release is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Use of the drug in patients below the age of 18 is not recommended. Geriatric Use In the clinical efficacy trials for carbidopa and levodopa, almost half of the patients were older than 65, but few were older than 75. No overall meaningful differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals to adverse drug reactions such as hallucinations cannot be ruled out. There is no specific dosing recommendation based upon clinical pharmacology data as carbidopa and levodopa and carbidopa and levodopa extended-release are titrated as tolerated for clinical effect.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS In controlled clinical trials, patients predominantly with moderate to severe motor fluctuations while on carbidopa and levodopa were randomized to therapy with either carbidopa and levodopa or carbidopa and levodopa extended-release. The adverse experience frequency profile of carbidopa and levodopa extended-release did not differ substantially from that of carbidopa and levodopa, as shown in Table 1. Table 1: Clinical Adverse Experiences Occurring in 1% or Greater of Patients Adverse Experience Carbidopa and Levodopa Extended-release n = 491 % Carbidopa and Levodopa n = 524 % Dyskinesia 16.5 12.2 Nausea 5.5 5.7 Hallucinations 3.9 3.2 Confusion 3.7 2.3 Dizziness 2.9 2.3 Depression 2.2 1.3 Urinary tract infection 2.2 2.3 Headache 2.0 1.9 Dream abnormalities 1.8 0.8 Dystonia 1.8 0.8 Vomiting 1.8 1.9 Upper respiratory infection 1.8 1.0 Dyspnea 1.6 0.4 â€˜On-Offâ€™ phenomena 1.6 1.1 Back pain 1.6 0.6 Dry mouth 1.4 1.1 Anorexia 1.2 1.1 Diarrhea 1.2 0.6 Insomnia 1.2 1.0 Orthostatic hypotension 1.0 1.1 Shoulder pain 1.0 0.6 Chest pain 1.0 0.8 Muscle cramps 0.8 1.0 Paresthesia 0.8 1.1 Urinary frequency 0.8 1.1 Dyspepsia 0.6 1.1 Constipation 0.2 1.5 Abnormal laboratory findings occurring at a frequency of 1% or greater in approximately 443 patients who received carbidopa and levodopa extended-release and 475 who received carbidopa and levodopa during controlled clinical trials included: decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit; elevated serum glucose; white blood cells, bacteria and blood in the urine.
