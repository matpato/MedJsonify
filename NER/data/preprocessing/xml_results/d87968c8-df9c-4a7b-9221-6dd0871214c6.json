  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE MS CONTIN is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. MS CONTIN is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use ( 1 ) Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, reserve MS CONTIN for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options ( e.g. , non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids ) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. MS CONTIN is not indicated as an as-needed ( prn ) analgesic. Limitations of Use Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death with extended- release/long-acting opioid formulations [see , reserve MS CONTIN for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options ( e.g. , non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids ) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain. Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] MS CONTIN is not indicated as an as-needed ( prn ) analgesic.",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS MS CONTIN is contraindicated in patients with: Significant respiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ] Hypersensitivity ( e.g. , anaphylaxis ) to morphine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] Significant respiratory depression ( 4 ) Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment ( 4 ) Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) or use of MAOIs within the last 14 days ( 4 ) Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus ( 4 ) Hypersensitivity to morphine ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia ( OIH ) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation. ( 5.6 ) Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Regularly evaluate, particularly during initiation and titration. ( 5.7 ) Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.9 ) Severe Hypotension : Regularly evaluate during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness : Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of MS CONTIN in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse MS CONTIN contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, MS CONTIN exposes its users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Because extended-release products such as MS CONTIN deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present [see . Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) ] Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed MS CONTIN. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing MS CONTIN, and reassess all patients receiving MS CONTIN for development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse ( including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction ) or mental illness ( e.g. , major depression ) . The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as MS CONTIN, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks of proper use of MS CONTIN along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Abuse or misuse of MS CONTIN by crushing, chewing, snorting, or injecting the dissolved product will result in the uncontrolled delivery of morphine and can result in overdose and death [see . Overdosage ( 10 ) ] Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing MS CONTIN. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug . Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see . Carbon dioxide ( CO Overdosage ( 10 ) ] 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of MS CONTIN, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of MS CONTIN are essential [see . Overestimating the MS CONTIN dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] Accidental ingestion of even one dose of MS CONTIN, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of morphine. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose. Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea ( CSA ) and sleep- related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ] Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with MS CONTIN. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines ( e.g. , by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program ) . Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered . Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient's risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members ( including children ) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.3 ) , Overdosage ( 10 ) ] . 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of MS CONTIN with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol ( e.g. , non- benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids ) . Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression ( including sedation ) . If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) , Overdosage ( 10 ) ] . Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when MS CONTIN is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants ( including alcohol and illicit drugs ) . Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] 5.4 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of MS CONTIN for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] 5.5 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education ( CE ) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide ( PCG ) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient- prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 1-800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . 5.6 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia ( OIH ) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence ( 9.3 ) ] . Symptoms of OIH include ( but may not be limited to ) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli ( allodynia ) . These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation ( safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety ) [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ) ] 5.7 Risk of Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of MS CONTIN in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : MS CONTIN-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of MS CONTIN [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating MS CONTIN and when MS CONTIN is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] 5.8 Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) may potentiate the effects of morphine, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. MS CONTIN should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension MS CONTIN may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs ( e.g. , phenothiazines or general anesthetics ) [see . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of MS CONTIN. In patients with circulatory shock, MS CONTIN may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of MS CONTIN in patients with circulatory shock. 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention ( e.g. , those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors ) , MS CONTIN may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Regularly evaluate such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with MS CONTIN. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of MS CONTIN in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions MS CONTIN is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The morphine in MS CONTIN may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The morphine in MS CONTIN may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during MS CONTIN therapy. 5.14 Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue MS CONTIN in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing MS CONTIN in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of morphine in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) , Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ] . Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist ( e.g. , pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol ) or partial agonist ( e.g. , buprenorphine ) analgesics in patients who have received or are receiving a course of therapy with a full opioid agonist analgesic, including MS CONTIN. In these patients, mixed agonists/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery MS CONTIN may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of MS CONTIN and know how they will react to the medication.",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Interactions with Benzodiazepine or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ) ] Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( >10% ) : constipation, nausea, and sedation.

MS CONTIN may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock [see . Overdosage ( 10 ) ] Most Frequently Observed Reactions In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with MS CONTIN were constipation, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, sweating, dysphoria, and euphoric mood. Some of these effects seem to be more prominent in ambulatory patients and in those not experiencing severe pain. Less Frequently Observed Reactions Cardiovascular disorders: tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations Eye disorders: visual impairment, vision blurred, diplopia, miosis Gastrointestinal disorders: dry mouth, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia General disorders and administration site conditions: chills, feeling abnormal, edema, edema peripheral, weakness Hepatobiliary disorders: biliary colic Metabolism and nutrition disorders: anorexia Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle rigidity, muscle twitching Nervous system disorders: presyncope, syncope, headache, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, convulsion, intracranial pressure increased, taste alteration, paresthesia, nystagmus Psychiatric disorders: agitation, mood altered, anxiety, depression, abnormal dreams, hallucination, disorientation, insomnia Renal and urinary disorders: urinary retention, urinary hesitation, antidiuretic effects Reproductive system and breast disorders: reduced libido and/or potency Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: laryngospasm Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pruritus, urticaria, rash Vascular disorders: flushing, hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MS CONTIN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Amenorrhea, asthenia, bronchospasm, confusional state , drug hypersensitivity, fatigue, hyperalgesia, hypertonia, ileus, increased hepatic enzymes, intestinal obstruction, lethargy, malaise, pulmonary edema, thinking disturbances, somnolence, and vertigo . Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in MS CONTIN. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time. [see . Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) ] Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] . Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor ( e.g. , diabetes ) ."
