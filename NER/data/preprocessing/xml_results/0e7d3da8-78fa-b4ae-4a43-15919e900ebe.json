(4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions with\ncardiovascular, respiratory and cutaneous manifestations, ranging\nfrom mild to severe reactions including shock can occur. Monitor patients\nclosely for need of emergency cardiorespiratory support. (5.3) Gadolinium is retained for months or years in brain, bone,\nand other organs. (5.4) 5.1  Risk Associated\nwith Intrathecal Use Intrathecal administration of GBCAs can\ncause serious adverse reactions including death, coma, encephalopathy,\nand seizures. The safety and effectiveness of MultiHance have not\nbeen established with intrathecal use. MultiHance is not approved\nfor intrathecal use [see Dosage and Administration . (2.1) ] 5.2  Nephrogenic Systemic\nFibrosis GBCAs increase\nthe risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with\nimpaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of MultiHance among these\npatients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available\nwith non-contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated\nNSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney\ndisease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) as well\nas patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients\nwith chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild\nkidney disease (GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the\nskin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following\nMultiHance administration to Bracco Diagnostics (1-800-257-5181) or\nFDA (1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch ). Screen patients for acute\nkidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function.\nFeatures of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days)\nand usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the\nsetting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney\ntoxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably\nassess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients\nat risk for chronically reduced renal function (e.g., age >60 years,\ndiabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through\nlaboratory testing. Among the\nfactors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher\nthan recommended doses of a GBCA and the degree of renal impairment\nat the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered\nto a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed\nthe recommended MultiHance dose and allow a sufficient period of time\nfor elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients\nreceiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation\nof hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to\nenhance the contrast agent’s elimination. The usefulness of hemodialysis\nin the prevention of NSF is unknown [ see Dosage and Administration ]. (2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12) 5.3  Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported,\ninvolving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous manifestations.\n Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most\ncases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of MultiHance administration\nand resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Prior to MultiHance administration, ensure the availability\nof personnel trained and medications to treat hypersensitivity reactions.\n If such a reaction occurs stop MultiHance and immediately begin appropriate\ntherapy. Additionally, consider the risk for hypersensitivity reactions,\nespecially in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions\nor a history of asthma or other allergic disorders.  Observe patients\nfor signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction during and for\nup to 2 hours after MultiHance administration. 5.4  Gadolinium Retention Gadolinium is retained for months or\nyears in several organs. The highest concentrations (nanomoles per\ngram of tissue) have been identified in the bone, followed by other\norgans (e.g. brain, skin, kidney, liver, and spleen). The duration\nof retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear\nGBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. At equivalent doses,\ngadolinium retention varies among the linear agents with Omniscan\n(gadodiamide) and Optimark (gadoversetamide) causing greater retention\nthan other linear agents [Eovist (gadoxetate disodium), Magnevist\n(gadopentetate dimeglumine), MultiHance (gadobenate dimeglumine)].\nRetention is lowest and similar among the macrocyclic GBCAs [Dotarem\n(gadoterate meglumine), Gadavist (gadobutrol), ProHance (gadoteridol)]. Consequences of gadolinium\nretention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical\nconsequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other\norgans have been established in patients with impaired renal function [see Warnings and Precautions . There are rare reports of pathologic skin changes in\npatients with normal renal function. Adverse events involving multiple\norgan systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function\nwithout an established causal link to gadolinium retention (5.2) ] [see Adverse Reactions . (6.2) ] While clinical\nconsequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in\npatients with normal renal function, certain patients might be at\nhigher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses,\npregnant and pediatric patients, and patients with inflammatory conditions.\nConsider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing\na GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies,\nparticularly closely spaced studies when possible. 5.5  Acute Renal Failure In patients with renal insufficiency, acute renal failure requiring\ndialysis or worsening renal function have occurred with the use of\ngadolinium-based contrast agents.  The risk of renal failure may increase\nwith increasing dose of the contrast agent.  Screen all patients for\nrenal dysfunction by obtaining a history and/or laboratory tests.\n Consider follow-up renal function assessments for patients with a\nhistory of renal dysfunction. 5.6  Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions Extravasation of MultiHance may lead to\ninjection site reactions, characterized by local pain or burning sensation,\nswelling, blistering, and necrosis.  In animal experiments, local\nreactions including eschar and necrosis were noted even on Day 8 post\nperivenous injection of MultiHance.  Exercise caution to avoid local\nextravasation during intravenous administration of MultiHance. If\nextravasation occurs, evaluate and treat as necessary if local reactions\ndevelop. 5.7  Cardiac Arrhythmias Cardiac arrhythmias have been observed in patients receiving MultiHance\nin clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ]. Assess patients for underlying\nconditions or medications that predispose to arrhythmias. (6.1) A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-hour\npost dose continuous monitoring, crossover study in 47 subjects evaluated\nthe effect of 0.2 mmol/kg MultiHance on ECG intervals, including QTc.\n The average changes in QTc values compared with placebo were minimal\n(<5 msec).  QTc prolongation between 30 and 60 msec were noted\nin 20 subjects who received MultiHance vs. 11 subjects who received\nplacebo.  Prolongations ≥61 msec were noted in 6 subjects who received\nMultiHance and in 3 subjects who received placebo.  None of these\nsubjects had associated malignant arrhythmias.  The effects on QTc\nby MultiHance dose, other drugs, and medical conditions were not systematically\nstudied. 5.8  Interference with Visualization of Certain Lesions Certain lesions seen on non-contrast images\nmay not be seen on contrast- images. Exercise caution when interpreting\ncontrast MR images in the absence of companion non-contrast MR images.",

Skin\nand Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Pediatric Patients In clinical trials of MultiHance in MRI\nof the CNS, 307 pediatric subjects received MultiHance at a dose of\n0.1 mmol/kg.  A total of 160 (52%) subjects were male and the overall\nmean age was 6.0 years (range, 2 days to 17 years).  A total of 211\n(69%) subjects were Caucasian, 24 (8%) Black, 15 (5%) Asian, 39 (13%),\nHispanic, 2 (<1%) in other racial groups, and for 16 (5%), race\nwas not reported.

The most commonly reported adverse reactions were\nvomiting (1.0%), pyrexia (0.7%), and hyperhidrosis (0.7%).  No subject\ndied during study participation. 6.2  Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been\nidentified during post approval use of MultiHance or other GBCAs.\n Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population\nof uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate\ntheir frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Acute pancreatitis with onset within 48 hours after GBCA administration. Immune System Disorders: Anaphylactic,\nanaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions manifested with various\ndegrees of severity up to anaphylactic shock, loss of consciousness\nand death.  The reactions generally involved signs or symptoms of\nrespiratory, cardiovascular, and/or mucocutaneous abnormalities. General Disorders and\nAdministration Site Conditions: Extravasation of MultiHance\nmay lead to injection site reactions, characterized by local pain\nor burning sensation, swelling, blistering, and necrosis [see\nWarnings and Precautions ( . 5.5 )] Adverse events\nwith variable onset and duration have been reported after GBCA administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( .
