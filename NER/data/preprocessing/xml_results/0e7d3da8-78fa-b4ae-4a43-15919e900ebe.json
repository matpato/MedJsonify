  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the central nervous system ( CNS ) in adults and pediatric patients ( including term neonates ) , to visualize lesions with abnormal blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity of the brain, spine, and associated tissues. ( 1.1 ) magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) to evaluate adults with known or suspected renal or aorto-ilio-femoral occlusive vascular disease. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) of the Central Nervous System ( CNS ) MultiHance is indicated for intravenous use in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) of the central nervous system ( CNS ) in adults and pediatric patients ( including term neonates ) , to visualize lesions with abnormal blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity of the brain, spine, and associated tissues. 1.2 Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) of Renal and Aorto-ilio-femoral Vessels MultiHance is indicated for use in magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) to evaluate adults with known or suspected renal or aorto-ilio-femoral occlusive vascular disease.",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS MultiHance is contraindicated in patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents [ ] . see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) MultiHance is contraindicated in patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents. ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity: anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions with cardiovascular, respiratory and cutaneous manifestations, ranging from mild to severe reactions including shock can occur. Monitor patients closely for need of emergency cardiorespiratory support. ( 5.3 ) Gadolinium is retained for months or years in brain, bone, and other organs. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Risk Associated with Intrathecal Use Intrathecal administration of GBCAs can cause serious adverse reactions including death, coma, encephalopathy, and seizures. The safety and effectiveness of MultiHance have not been established with intrathecal use. MultiHance is not approved for intrathecal use [see Dosage and Administration . ( 2.1 ) ] 5.2 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of MultiHance among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease ( GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease ( GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease ( GFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) . NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following MultiHance administration to Bracco Diagnostics ( 1-800-257-5181 ) or FDA ( 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch ) . Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid ( over hours to days ) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function ( e.g. , age >60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension ) , estimate the GFR through laboratory testing. Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended MultiHance dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent’s elimination. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [ see Dosage and Administration ] . ( 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported, involving cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or cutaneous manifestations. Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died. In most cases, initial symptoms occurred within minutes of MultiHance administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Prior to MultiHance administration, ensure the availability of personnel trained and medications to treat hypersensitivity reactions. If such a reaction occurs stop MultiHance and immediately begin appropriate therapy. Additionally, consider the risk for hypersensitivity reactions, especially in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions or a history of asthma or other allergic disorders. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction during and for up to 2 hours after MultiHance administration. 5.4 Gadolinium Retention Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. The highest concentrations ( nanomoles per gram of tissue ) have been identified in the bone, followed by other organs ( e.g. brain, skin, kidney, liver, and spleen ) . The duration of retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. At equivalent doses, gadolinium retention varies among the linear agents with Omniscan ( gadodiamide ) and Optimark ( gadoversetamide ) causing greater retention than other linear agents [Eovist ( gadoxetate disodium ) , Magnevist ( gadopentetate dimeglumine ) , MultiHance ( gadobenate dimeglumine ) ] . Retention is lowest and similar among the macrocyclic GBCAs [Dotarem ( gadoterate meglumine ) , Gadavist ( gadobutrol ) , ProHance ( gadoteridol ) ] . Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function [see Warnings and Precautions . There are rare reports of pathologic skin changes in patients with normal renal function. Adverse events involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium retention ( 5.2 ) ] [see Adverse Reactions . ( 6.2 ) ] While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function, certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses, pregnant and pediatric patients, and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies, particularly closely spaced studies when possible. 5.5 Acute Renal Failure In patients with renal insufficiency, acute renal failure requiring dialysis or worsening renal function have occurred with the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents. The risk of renal failure may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent. Screen all patients for renal dysfunction by obtaining a history and/or laboratory tests. Consider follow-up renal function assessments for patients with a history of renal dysfunction. 5.6 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions Extravasation of MultiHance may lead to injection site reactions, characterized by local pain or burning sensation, swelling, blistering, and necrosis. In animal experiments, local reactions including eschar and necrosis were noted even on Day 8 post perivenous injection of MultiHance. Exercise caution to avoid local extravasation during intravenous administration of MultiHance. If extravasation occurs, evaluate and treat as necessary if local reactions develop. 5.7 Cardiac Arrhythmias Cardiac arrhythmias have been observed in patients receiving MultiHance in clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ] . Assess patients for underlying conditions or medications that predispose to arrhythmias. ( 6.1 ) A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-hour post dose continuous monitoring, crossover study in 47 subjects evaluated the effect of 0.2 mmol/kg MultiHance on ECG intervals, including QTc. The average changes in QTc values compared with placebo were minimal ( <5 msec ) . QTc prolongation between 30 and 60 msec were noted in 20 subjects who received MultiHance vs. 11 subjects who received placebo. Prolongations ≥61 msec were noted in 6 subjects who received MultiHance and in 3 subjects who received placebo. None of these subjects had associated malignant arrhythmias. The effects on QTc by MultiHance dose, other drugs, and medical conditions were not systematically studied. 5.8 Interference with Visualization of Certain Lesions Certain lesions seen on non-contrast images may not be seen on contrast- images. Exercise caution when interpreting contrast MR images in the absence of companion non-contrast MR images.",

Adults In clinical trials with MultiHance, a total of 4967 adult subjects ( 137 healthy volunteers and 4830 patients ) received MultiHance at doses ranging from 0.005 to 0.4 mmol/kg. There were 2838 ( 57% ) men and 2129 ( 43% ) women with a mean age of 56.5 years ( range 18 to 93 years ) . A total of 4403 ( 89% ) subjects were Caucasian, 134 ( 3% ) Black, 275 ( 6% ) Asian, 40 ( 1% ) Hispanic, 70 ( 1% ) in other racial groups, and for 45 ( 1% ) subjects, race was not reported. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in adult subjects who received MultiHance were nausea ( 1.3% ) and headache ( 1.2% ) . Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity. One subject experienced a serious anaphylactoid reaction with laryngeal spasm and dyspnea [ see Warnings and Precautions ] . Serious adverse reactions consisting of convulsions, pulmonary edema, acute necrotizing pancreatitis, and anaphylactoid reactions were reported in 0.1% of subjects in clinical trials. ( 5.3 ) Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 0.5% of 4967 adult subjects who received MultiHance are listed below ( Table 2 ) , in decreasing order of occurrence within each system.

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Pediatric Patients In clinical trials of MultiHance in MRI of the CNS, 307 pediatric subjects received MultiHance at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg. A total of 160 ( 52% ) subjects were male and the overall mean age was 6.0 years ( range, 2 days to 17 years ) . A total of 211 ( 69% ) subjects were Caucasian, 24 ( 8% ) Black, 15 ( 5% ) Asian, 39 ( 13% ) , Hispanic, 2 ( <1% ) in other racial groups, and for 16 ( 5% ) , race was not reported. Adverse reactions were reported for 14 ( 4.6% ) of the subjects. The frequency and the nature of the adverse reactions were similar to those seen in the adult patients. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were vomiting ( 1.0% ) , pyrexia ( 0.7% ) , and hyperhidrosis ( 0.7% ) . No subject died during study participation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of MultiHance or other GBCAs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Acute pancreatitis with onset within 48 hours after GBCA administration. Immune System Disorders: Anaphylactic, anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions manifested with various degrees of severity up to anaphylactic shock, loss of consciousness and death. The reactions generally involved signs or symptoms of respiratory, cardiovascular, and/or mucocutaneous abnormalities. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Extravasation of MultiHance may lead to injection site reactions, characterized by local pain or burning sensation, swelling, blistering, and necrosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.5 ) ] Adverse events with variable onset and duration have been reported after GBCA administration [see Warnings and Precautions ( . These include fatigue, asthenia, pain syndromes, and heterogeneous clusters of symptoms in the neurological, cutaneous, and musculoskeletal systems. 5.4 ) ] Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema Skin: Gadolinium associated plaques."
