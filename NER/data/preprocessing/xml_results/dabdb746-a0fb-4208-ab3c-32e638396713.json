    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal Medication Errors: Confirm choice of correct strength prior to administration ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Hemorrhage, including fatal events, has occurred in patients receiving heparin. Use caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage ( 5.2 ) HIT and HITTS: Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue if indicative of HIT and HITTS ( 5.3 ) Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity: Use preservative-free formulation in neonates and infants Monitoring: Blood coagulation tests guide therapy for full-dose heparin. Periodically monitor platelet count, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool in all patients receiving heparin ( 5.5 , 5.6 ) Hyperkalemia: Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Fatal Medication Errors Do not use heparin sodium injection as a “catheter lock flush” product. Heparin sodium injection is supplied in vials containing various strengths of heparin, including vials that contain a highly concentrated solution of 10,000 units in 1 mL. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred in pediatric patients due to medication errors in which 1 mL heparin sodium injection vials were confused with 1 mL “catheter lock flush” vials. Carefully examine all heparin sodium injection vials to confirm the correct vial choice prior to administration of the drug. 5.2 Hemorrhage Avoid using heparin in the presence of major bleeding, except when the benefits of heparin therapy outweigh the potential risks. Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin. Fatal hemorrhages have occurred. Adrenal hemorrhage (with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency), ovarian hemorrhage, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage have occurred during anticoagulant therapy with heparin [see Adverse Reactions ( . A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age 6.1 )] [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event. 12.3 )] Use heparin sodium with caution in disease states in which there is increased risk of hemorrhage, including: Cardiovascular - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension. Surgical - During and immediately following (a) spinal tap or spinal anesthesia or (b) major surgery, especially involving the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Hematologic - Conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies, such as hemophilia, thrombocytopenia and some vascular purpuras. Patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency receiving concurrent antithrombin III therapy - The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, reduce the heparin dose during concomitant treatment with antithrombin III (human). Gastrointestinal - Ulcerative lesions and continuous tube drainage of the stomach or small intestine. Other - Menstruation, liver disease with impaired hemostasis. 5.3 Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious antibody-mediated reaction. HIT occurs in patients treated with heparin and is due to the development of antibodies to a platelet Factor 4-heparin complex that induce in vivo platelet aggregation. HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT). Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HITT. These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and possibly death. If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant. HIT or HITT can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy. Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT or HITT. 5.4 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative Serious and fatal adverse reactions including “gasping syndrome” can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials. The “gasping syndrome” is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including heparin sodium injection multiple-dose vials and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin has been reported at frequencies up to 30%. It can occur 2 to 20 days (average 5 to 9) following the onset of heparin therapy. Obtain platelet counts before and periodically during heparin therapy. Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely. If the count falls below 100,000/mm 3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, promptly discontinue heparin, evaluate for HIT and HITT, and, if necessary, administer an alternative anticoagulant [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] 5.6 Coagulation Testing and Monitoring When using a full dose heparin sodium regimen, adjust the heparin sodium dose based on frequent blood coagulation tests. If the coagulation test is unduly prolonged or if hemorrhage occurs, discontinue heparin sodium promptly [see Overdosage ( . Periodically monitor platelet counts, hematocrit, and occult blood in stool during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration 10 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.7 Heparin Resistance Resistance to heparin is frequently encountered in fever, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, infections with thrombosing tendencies, myocardial infarction, cancer, in postsurgical patients, and patients with antithrombin III deficiency. Close monitoring of coagulation tests is recommended in these cases. Adjustment of heparin doses based on anti-Factor Xa levels may be warranted. 5.8 Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Because Heparin Sodium Injection is derived from animal tissue, it should be used with caution in patients with a history of allergy. 5.9 Hyperkalemia Heparin can suppress adrenal secretion of aldosterone leading to hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, pre-existing metabolic acidosis, a raised plasma potassium, or taking potassium sparing drugs. The risk of hyperkalemia appears to increase with duration of therapy but is usually reversible upon discontinuation of heparin. Measure blood potassium in patients at risk of hyperkalemia before starting heparin therapy and periodically in all patients treated for more than 5 days or earlier as deemed fit by the clinician.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Heparin Resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions are hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, HIT and HITTS, injection site irritation, general hypersensitivity reactions, and elevations of aminotransferase levels. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Heparin Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhage - Hemorrhage is the chief complication that may result from heparin therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( . Gastrointestinal or urinary tract bleeding during anticoagulant therapy may indicate the presence of an underlying occult lesion. Bleeding can occur at any site but certain specific hemorrhagic complications may be difficult to detect including: 5.2 )] Adrenal hemorrhage, with resultant acute adrenal insufficiency, has occurred with heparin therapy, including fatal cases. Ovarian (corpus luteum) hemorrhage developed in a number of women of reproductive age receiving short- or long-term heparin therapy. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage HIT and HITT, including delayed onset cases [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] Local Irritation – Local irritation, erythema, mild pain, hematoma or ulceration may follow deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injection of heparin sodium. Because these complications are much more common after intramuscular use, the intramuscular route is not recommended. Histamine-like reactions – Such reactions have been observed at the site of injections. Necrosis of the skin has been reported at the site of subcutaneous injection of heparin, occasionally requiring skin grafting [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] Hypersensitivity - Generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, with chills, fever and urticaria as the most usual manifestations, and asthma, rhinitis, lacrimation, headache, nausea and vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions, including shock, occurring less frequently. Itching and burning, especially on the plantar side of the feet, may occur. [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Elevations of aminotransferases - Significant elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have occurred in patients who have received heparin. Others - Osteoporosis following long-term administration of high doses of heparin, cutaneous necrosis after systemic administration, suppression of aldosterone synthesis, delayed transient alopecia, priapism, and rebound hyperlipemia on discontinuation of heparin sodium have also been reported. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders – Hyperkalemia."
