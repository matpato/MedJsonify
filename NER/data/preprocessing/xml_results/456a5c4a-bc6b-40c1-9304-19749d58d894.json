  "indications": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ethacrynic acid is indicated for treatment of edema when an agent with greater diuretic potential than those commonly employed is required. 1. Treatment of the edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. 2. Short-term management of ascites due to malignancy, idiopathic edema, and lymphedema. 3. Short-term management of hospitalized pediatric patients, other than infants, with congenital heart disease or the nephrotic syndrome. 4. Intravenous ethacrynate sodium for injection is indicated when a rapid onset of diuresis is desired, e.g. , in acute pulmonary edema, or when gastrointestinal absorption is impaired or oral medication is not practicable.",
  "contraindications": "CONTRAINDICATIONS All diuretics, including ethacrynic acid, are contraindicated in anuria. If increasing electrolyte imbalance, azotemia, and/or oliguria occur during treatment of severe, progressive renal disease, the diuretic should be discontinued. In a few patients this diuretic has produced severe, watery diarrhea. If this occurs, it should be discontinued and not used again. Until further experience in infants is accumulated, therapy with oral and parenteral ethacrynic acid is contraindicated. Hypersensitivity to any component of this product.",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS The effects of ethacrynic acid on electrolytes are related to its renal pharmacologic activity and are dose dependent. The possibility of profound electrolyte and water loss may be avoided by weighing the patient throughout the treatment period, by careful adjustment of dosage, by initiating treatment with small doses, and by using the drug on an intermittent schedule when possible. When excessive diuresis occurs, the drug should be withdrawn until homeostasis is restored. When excessive electrolyte loss occurs, the dosage should be reduced or the drug temporarily withdrawn. Initiation of diuretic therapy with ethacrynic acid in the cirrhotic patient with ascites is best carried out in the hospital. When maintenance therapy has been established, the individual can be satisfactorily followed as an outpatient. Ethacrynic acid should be given with caution to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, particularly those with a history of previous episodes of electrolyte imbalance or hepatic encephalopathy. Like other diuretics it may precipitate hepatic coma and death. Too vigorous a diuresis, as evidenced by rapid and excessive weight loss, may induce an acute hypotensive episode. In elderly cardiac patients, rapid contraction of plasma volume and the resultant hemoconcentration should be avoided to prevent the development of thromboembolic episodes, such as cerebral vascular thromboses and pulmonary emboli which may be fatal. Excessive loss of potassium in patients receiving digitalis glycosides may precipitate digitalis toxicity. Care should also be exercised in patients receiving potassium-depleting steroids. A number of possibly drug-related deaths have occurred in critically ill patients refractory to other diuretics. These generally have fallen into two categories: ( 1 ) patients with severe myocardial disease who have been receiving digitalis and presumably developed acute hypokalemia with fatal arrhythmia; ( 2 ) patients with severely decompensated hepatic cirrhosis with ascites, with or without accompanying encephalopathy, who were in electrolyte imbalance and died because of intensification of the electrolyte defect. Deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo with a sense of fullness in the ears have occurred, most frequently in patients with severe impairment of renal function. These symptoms have been associated most often with intravenous administration and with doses in excess of those recommended. The deafness has usually been reversible and of short duration ( 1 to 24 hours ) . However, in some patients the hearing loss has been permanent. A number of these patients were also receiving drugs known to be ototoxic. Ethacrynic acid may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs ( see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) . Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics ( see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ) . PRECAUTIONS General Weakness, muscle cramps, paresthesias, thirst, anorexia, and signs of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and/or hypochloremic alkalosis may occur following vigorous or excessive diuresis and these may be accentuated by rigid salt restriction. Rarely, tetany has been reported following vigorous diuresis. During therapy with ethacrynic acid, liberalization of salt intake and supplementary potassium chloride are often necessary. When a metabolic alkalosis may be anticipated, e.g. , in cirrhosis with ascites, the use of potassium chloride or a potassium-sparing agent before and during therapy with ethacrynic acid may mitigate or prevent the hypokalemia. Loop diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia. The safety and efficacy of ethacrynic acid in hypertension have not been established. However, the dosage of coadministered antihypertensive agents may require adjustment. Orthostatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving other antihypertensive agents when given ethacrynic acid. Ethacrynic acid has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis. A transient increase in serum urea nitrogen may occur. Usually, this is readily reversible when the drug is discontinued. As with other diuretics used in the treatment of renal edema, hypoproteinemia may reduce responsiveness to ethacrynic acid and the use of salt-poor albumin should be considered. A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs. Ethacrynic acid may increase the risk of gastric hemorrhage associated with corticosteroid treatment. Laboratory Tests Frequent serum electrolyte, CO 2 and BUN determinations should be performed early in therapy and periodically thereafter during active diuresis. Any electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected or the drug temporarily withdrawn. Increases in blood glucose and alterations in glucose tolerance tests have been observed in patients receiving ethacrynic acid. Drug Interactions Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Read circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy. Ethacrynic acid may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as aminoglycoside and some cephalosporin antibiotics. Their concurrent use should be avoided. A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs. In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when ethacrynic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect in a 79-week oral chronic toxicity study in rats at doses up to 45 times the human dose. Ethacrynic acid had no effect on fertility in a two-litter study in rats or a two-generation study in mice at 10 times the human dose. Pregnancy Reproduction studies in the mouse and rabbit at doses up to 50 times the human dose showed no evidence of external abnormalities of the fetus due to ethacrynic acid. In a two-litter study in the dog and rat, oral doses of 5 or 20 mg/kg/day ( 2½ or 10 times the human dose ) , respectively, did not interfere with pregnancy or with growth and development of the pups. Although there was reduction in the mean body weights of the fetuses in a teratogenic study in the rat at a dose level of 100 mg/kg ( 50 times the human dose ) , there was no effect on mortality or postnatal development. Functional and morphologic abnormalities were not observed. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, ethacrynic acid should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ethacrynic acid, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use There are no well controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients. The information on oral dosing in pediatric patients, other than infants, is supported by evidence from empiric use in this age group. For information on oral use in pediatric patients, other than infants, see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Safety and effectiveness of oral and parenteral use in infants have not been established ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) . Safety and effectiveness of intravenous use in pediatric patients have not been established ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Intravenous Use ) . Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of ethacrynic acid, approximately 224 patients ( 21% ) were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 100 patients ( 9% ) were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. ( See WARNINGS . ) This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS . )",
  "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, malaise, abdominal discomfort or pain, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have occurred. These are more frequent with large doses or after one to three months of continuous therapy. A few patients have had sudden onset of profuse, watery diarrhea. Discontinue ethacrynic acid if diarrhea is severe and do not give it again. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred in some patients. Rarely, acute pancreatitis has been reported. Metabolic: Reversible hyperuricemia and acute gout have been reported. Acute symptomatic hypoglycemia with convulsions occurred in two uremic patients who received doses above those recommended. Hyperglycemia has been reported. Rarely, jaundice and abnormal liver function tests have been reported in seriously ill patients receiving multiple drug therapy, including ethacrynic acid. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis or severe neutropenia has been reported in a few critically ill patients also receiving agents known to produce this effect. Thrombocytopenia has been reported rarely. Henoch-Schönlein purpura has been reported rarely in patients with rheumatic heart disease receiving multiple drug therapy, including ethacrynic acid. Special Senses: ( See WARNINGS. ) Deafness, tinnitus and vertigo with a sense of fullness in the ears, and blurred vision have occurred. Central Nervous System: Headache, fatigue, apprehension, confusion. Miscellaneous: Skin rash, fever, chills, hematuria. Ethacrynate sodium for injection occasionally has caused local irritation and pain after intravenous use."
