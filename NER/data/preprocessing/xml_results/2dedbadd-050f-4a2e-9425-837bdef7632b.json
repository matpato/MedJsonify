  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infections: Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, evaluate promptly, and treat. ( 5.1 ) Hemorrhage: Monitor for bleeding and manage appropriately. ( 5.2 ) Cytopenias: Monitor complete blood counts during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Cardiac Arrythmias: Monitor for symptoms of arrhythmias and manage appropriately. ( 5.4 ) Second Primary Malignancies: Other malignancies have developed, including skin cancers and other carcinomas. Monitor and advise patients to use sun protection. ( 5.5 ) Hepatotoxicity, Including Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Monitor hepatic function throughout treatment. ( 5.6 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Infections Fatal and serious infections ( including bacterial, viral, or fungal infections ) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients treated with JAYPIRCA. In the clinical trial, Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 24% of 593 patients, most commonly pneumonia ( 14% ) , with fatal infections occurring in 4.4% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 6% of patients and febrile neutropenia in 4% . In patients with CLL/SLL, Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 32% of patients, with fatal infections occurring in 8% . Opportunistic infections after treatment with JAYPIRCA have included, but are not limited to, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and fungal infection [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 ) ] Consider prophylaxis, including vaccinations and antimicrobial prophylaxis, in patients who are at increased risk for infections, including opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection, evaluate promptly, and treat appropriately. Based on severity, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue JAYPIRCA [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ) ] 5.2 Hemorrhage Fatal and serious hemorrhage has occurred with JAYPIRCA. Major hemorrhage ( defined as Grade 3 or higher bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding ) occurred in 3% of 593 patients treated with JAYPIRCA, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.3% of patients. Bleeding of any grade, excluding bruising and petechiae, occurred in 17% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 ) ] Major hemorrhage occurred in 2.3% of patients taking JAYPIRCA without antithrombotic agents and 0.7% of patients taking JAYPIRCA with antithrombotic agents. Consider the risks and benefits of antithrombotic agents when co-administered with JAYPIRCA. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding. Based on severity of bleeding, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue JAYPIRCA [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ) ] Consider the benefit-risk of withholding JAYPIRCA for 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and risk of bleeding. 5.3 Cytopenias JAYPIRCA can cause cytopenias, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. In the clinical trial, Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including decreased neutrophils ( 26% ) , decreased platelets ( 12% ) , and decreased hemoglobin ( 12% ) developed in patients treated with JAYPIRCA. Grade 4 decreased neutrophils developed in 14% of patients and Grade 4 decreased platelets developed in 6% of patients [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 ) ] Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment. Based on severity, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue JAYPIRCA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . 5.4 Cardiac Arrhythmias Cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, were reported in recipients of JAYPIRCA. Atrial fibrillation or flutter were reported in 3.2% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or flutter reported in 1.5% of 593 patients in the clinical trial [see Adverse Reactions ( . Other serious cardiac arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest occurred in 0.5% of patients. Patients with cardiac risk factors, such as hypertension, or previous arrhythmias may be at increased risk. 6.1 ) ] Monitor for signs and symptoms of arrhythmias ( e.g. , palpitations, dizziness, syncope, dyspnea ) and manage appropriately. Based on severity, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue JAYPIRCA [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ) ] 5.5 Second Primary Malignancies Second primary malignancies, including non-skin carcinomas, developed in 9% of 593 patients treated with JAYPIRCA monotherapy. The most frequent malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer, reported in 4.6% of 593 patients. Other second primary malignancies included solid tumors ( including genitourinary and breast cancers ) and melanoma. Advise patients to use sun protection and monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. 5.6 Hepatotoxicity, Including Drug-Induced Liver Injury Hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-threatening, and potentially fatal cases of drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) , has occurred in patients treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including JAYPIRCA. Evaluate bilirubin and transaminases at baseline and throughout treatment with JAYPIRCA. For patients who develop abnormal liver tests after JAYPIRCA, monitor more frequently for liver test abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms of hepatic toxicity. If DILI is suspected, withhold JAYPIRCA. Upon confirmation of DILI, discontinue JAYPIRCA. 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals, JAYPIRCA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of pirtobrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity including embryo-fetal mortality and malformations at maternal exposures ( AUC ) approximately 3-times the recommended dose of 200 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with JAYPIRCA and for one week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ] .",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Second Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Hepatotoxicity, including DILI [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 20% ) are fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, COVID-19, bruising, and cough. Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities ( ≥ 10% ) are neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, hemoglobin decreased, and lymphocyte count decreased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx ( 1-800-545-5979 ) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in the general patient population. The data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to JAYPIRCA as a single-agent, administered at 200 mg once daily in 593 patients with hematologic malignancies in the BRUIN study. Among these 593 patients, the median duration of exposure was 10 months, 62% were exposed for at least 6 months and 45% were exposed for at least one year. In this pooled safety population, the most common ( ≥ 20% ) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased neutrophil count ( 46% ) , decreased hemoglobin ( 39% ) , fatigue ( 32% ) , decreased lymphocyte count ( 31% ) , musculoskeletal pain ( 30% ) , decreased platelet count ( 29% ) , diarrhea ( 24% ) , COVID-19 ( 22% ) , bruising ( 21% ) , and cough ( 20% ) . Mantle Cell Lymphoma BRUIN The safety of JAYPIRCA was evaluated in the BRUIN trial in patients with MCL who received a prior BTK inhibitor [see Clinical Studies ( ) 14.1 ] .

The trial excluded patients with active central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement by lymphoma, significant cardiovascular disease, major bleeding or grade ≥ 3 arrhythmia with a prior BTK inhibitor, prolonged QTc interval, or need for a strong CYP3 A inhibitor or inducer or strong P-gp inhibitor. Patients received JAYPIRCA 200 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity ( n = 128 ) ; 36% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 10% were exposed for at least one year. The median number of prior therapies was 3 ( range: 1-9 ) . The median age was 71 years ( range: 46 to 88 years ) and 80% of patients were male. Race was reported for all patients; 78% were White, 14% were Asian, 2.3% were Black, and 2.3% were Hispanic or Latino. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients who received JAYPIRCA. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of patients were pneumonia ( 14% ) , COVID-19 ( 4.7% ) , musculoskeletal pain ( 3.9% ) , hemorrhage ( 2.3% ) , pleural effusion ( 2.3% ) , and sepsis ( 2.3% ) . Fatal adverse reactions within 28 days of the last dose of JAYPIRCA occurred in 7% of patients, most commonly due to infections ( 4.7% ) including COVID-19 ( 3.1% of all patients ) . Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 4.7% , treatment interruption in 32% , and permanent discontinuation of JAYPIRCA in 9% . Adverse reactions that resulted in dosage modification in > 5% of patients included pneumonia and neutropenia. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of JAYPIRCA in > 1% of patients included pneumonia. The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 15% ) , excluding laboratory terms, were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, edema, dyspnea, pneumonia, and bruising.
