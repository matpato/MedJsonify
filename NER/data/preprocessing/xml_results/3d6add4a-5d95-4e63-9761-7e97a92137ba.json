    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Catecholamine Release in Patients with Pheochromocytoma : Contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because Glucagon for Injection may stimulate the release of catecholamines from the tumor. ( 4 , 5.1 ) Hypoglycemia in Patients with Insulinoma: In patients with insulinoma, administration may produce an initial increase in blood glucose; however, Glucagon for Injection may stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycemia. If a patient develops symptoms of hypoglycemia after a dose of Glucagon for Injection, give glucose orally or intravenously. ( 4 , 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions: Allergic reactions have been reported and include generalized rash, and in some cases anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties, and hypotension. ( 4 , 5.3 ) Lack of Efficacy in Patients with Decreased Hepatic Glycogen: Glucagon for Injection is effective in treating hypoglycemia only if sufficient hepatic glycogen is present. Patients in states of starvation, with adrenal insufficiency or chronic hypoglycemia may not have adequate levels of hepatic glycogen for Glucagon for Injection to be effective. Patients with these conditions should be treated with glucose. ( 5.4 ) Necrolytic Migratory Erythema (NME): a skin rash, has been reported postmarketing following continuous glucagon infusion and resolved with discontinuation of the glucagon. Should NME occur, consider whether the benefits of continuous glucagon infusion outweigh the risks. ( 5.5 ) Hyperglycemia in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus when Used as a Diagnostic Aid: Treatment with Glucagon for Injection in patients with diabetes mellitus may cause hyperglycemia. Monitor diabetic patients for changes in blood glucose levels during treatment and treat if indicated.( 5.6 ) Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increase in Patients with Cardiac Disease when Used as a Diagnostic Aid: Glucagon for Injection may increase myocardial oxygen demand, blood pressure, and pulse rate. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in patients with cardiac disease during use of Glucagon for Injection as a diagnostic aid, and an increase in blood pressure and pulse rate may require therapy. ( 5.7 ) Hypoglycemia in Patients with Glucagonoma when Used as a Diagnostic Aid: Glucagon administered to patients with glucagonoma may cause secondary hypoglycemia. Test patients suspected of having glucagonoma for blood levels of glucagon prior to treatment, and monitor blood glucose levels during treatment. If a patient develops hypoglycemia, give glucose orally or intravenously. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Catecholamine Release in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Glucagon for Injection is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma because glucagon may stimulate the release of catecholamines from the tumor [see Contraindications ( If the patient develops a dramatic increase in blood pressure and a previously undiagnosed pheochromocytoma is suspected, 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine mesylate, administered intravenously, has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. 4 )]. 5.2 Hypoglycemia in Patients with Insulinoma In patients with insulinoma, administration of glucagon may produce an initial increase in blood glucose; however, Glucagon for Injection administration may directly or indirectly (through an initial rise in blood glucose) stimulate exaggerated insulin release from an insulinoma and cause hypoglycemia. Glucagon for Injection is contraindicated in patients with insulinoma [see Contraindications ( If a patient develops symptoms of hypoglycemia after a dose of Glucagon for Injection, give glucose orally or intravenously. 4 )]. 5.3 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions have been reported with glucagon, these include generalized rash, and in some cases anaphylactic shock with breathing difficulties and hypotension. Glucagon for Injection is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.4 Lack of Efficacy in Patients with Decreased Hepatic Glycogen Glucagon for Injection is effective in treating hypoglycemia only if sufficient hepatic glycogen is present. Patients in states of starvation, with adrenal insufficiency or chronic hypoglycemia may not have adequate levels of hepatic glycogen for Glucagon for Injection administration to be effective. Patients with these conditions should be treated with glucose. 5.5 Necrolytic Migratory Erythema Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), a skin rash commonly associated with glucagonomas (glucagonproducing tumors) and characterized by scaly, pruritic erythematous plaques, bullae, and erosions, has been reported postmarketing following continuous glucagon infusion. NME lesions may affect the face, groin, perineum and legs or be more widespread. In the reported cases NME resolved with discontinuation of the glucagon, and treatment with corticosteroids was not effective. Should NME occur, consider whether the benefits of continuous glucagon infusion outweigh the risks. 5.6 Hyperglycemia in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus when Used as a Diagnostic Aid Treatment with Glucagon for Injection in patients with diabetes mellitus may cause hyperglycemia. Monitor diabetic patients for changes in blood glucose levels during treatment and treat if indicated. 5.7 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increase in Patients with Cardiac Disease when Used as a Diagnostic Aid Glucagon for Injection may increase myocardial oxygen demand, blood pressure, and pulse rate which may be life-threatening in patients with cardiac disease. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in patients with cardiac disease during use of Glucagon for Injection as a diagnostic aid, and an increase in blood pressure and pulse rate may require therapy. 5.8 Hypoglycemia in Patients with Glucagonoma Glucagon administered to patients with glucagonoma may cause secondary hypoglycemia.  Glucagon for Injection is contraindicated in patients with glucagonoma when used as a diagnostic aid [see Contraindications ( Test patients suspected of having glucagonoma for blood levels of glucagon prior to treatment, and monitor for changes in blood glucose levels during treatment.  If a patient develops symptoms of hypoglycemia after a dose of Glucagon for Injection, give glucose orally or intravenously. 4 )].",

In a randomized single-blind clinical study of Glucagon for Injection, 29 healthy subjects received a single dose of 1 mg Glucagon for Injection intramuscularly. Table 1 shows the most common adverse reactions that were not present at baseline and occurred in at least 5% of patients.

Table 2 shows the most common adverse reactions that were not present at baseline and occurred in at least 5% of patients. ( 2.1 )].

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic coma.  Patients taking indomethacin may be more likely to experience hypoglycemia following glucagon administration [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) cases have been reported postmarketing in patients receiving continuous infusion of glucagon."
