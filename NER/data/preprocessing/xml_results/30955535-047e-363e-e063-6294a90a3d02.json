  "indications": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) indicated for the: • Treatment of active duodenal ulcer in adults ( 1.1 ) • Eradication of Helicobacter pylori to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence in adults ( 1.2 ) • Treatment of active benign gastric ulcer in adults ( 1.3 ) • Treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) in patients 2 years of age and older ( 1.4 ) • Maintenance of healing of EE due to acid-mediated GERD in patients 2 years of age and older ( 1.6 ) • Pathologic hypersecretory conditions in adults ( 1.7 ) 1.1 Treatment of Active Duodenal Ulcer Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are indicated for short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer in adults. Most patients heal within four weeks. Some patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy. 1.2 Helicobacter pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Triple Therapy Omeprazole delayed-release capsules in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin, are indicated for treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease ( active or up to 1-year history ) to eradicate H. pylori in adults. Dual Therapy Omeprazole delayed-release capsules in combination with clarithromycin are indicated for treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease to eradicate H. pylori in adults. Among patients who fail therapy, omeprazole delayed-release capsules with clarithromycin are more likely to be associated with the development of clarithromycin resistance as compared with triple therapy. In patients who fail therapy, susceptibility testing should be done. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.4 ) and the clarithromycin prescribing information, Microbiology section] . 1.3 Treatment of Active Benign Gastric Ulcer Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are indicated for short-term treatment ( 4 to 8 weeks ) of active benign gastric ulcer in adults. 1.4 Treatment of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of heartburn and other symptoms associated with GERD for up to 4 weeks in patients 2 years of age and older. 1.5 Treatment of Erosive Esophagitis ( EE ) Due to Acid-Mediated GERD Pediatric Patients 2 Years of Age to Adults Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are indicated for the short-term treatment ( 4 to 8 weeks ) of EE due to acid-mediated GERD that has been diagnosed by endoscopy in patients 2 years of age and older. The efficacy of omeprazole delayed-release capsules used for longer than 8 weeks in patients with EE has not been established. If a patient does not respond to 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 4 weeks of treatment may be given. If there is recurrence of EE or GERD symptoms ( e.g. , heartburn ) , additional 4 to 8 week courses of omeprazole delayed-release capsules may be considered. 1.6 Maintenance of Healing of EE Due to Acid-Mediated GERD Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are indicated for the maintenance healing of EE due to acid-mediated GERD in patients 2 years of age and older. Controlled studies do not extend beyond 12 months. 1.7 Pathological Hypersecretory Conditions Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are indicated for the long-term treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions ( e.g. , Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, multiple endocrine adenomas and systemic mastocytosis ) in adults.",
  "contraindications": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis to the formulation or any substituted benzimidazole. Hypersensitivity reactions may include anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and urticaria [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] . • Proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs ) , including omeprazole, are contraindicated in patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . • For information about contraindications of antibacterial agents ( clarithromycin and amoxicillin ) indicated in combination with omeprazole, refer to the CONTRAINDICATIONS section of their package inserts. • Patients with known hypersensitivity to substituted benzimidazoles or any component of the formulation. ( 4 ) • Patients receiving rilpivirine-containing products. ( 4 , 7 ) • Refer to the Contraindications section of the prescribing information for clarithromycin and amoxicillin, when administered in combination with omeprazole. ( 4 )",
  "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy: In adults, symptomatic response does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. ( 5.1 ) Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis: Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients. ( 5.2 ) Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk. ( 5.3 ) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue omeprazole and refer to specialist for evaluation ( 5.6 ) Interaction with Clopidogrel: Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole. ( 5.7 , 7 ) Cyanocobalamin ( Vitamin B-12 ) Deficiency: Daily long-term use ( e.g. , longer than 3 years ) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.8 ) Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism: Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( 5.9 ) Interaction with St. John’s Wort or Rifampin: Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole. ( 5.10 , 7 ) Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors: Increased Chromogranin A ( CgA ) levels may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors; temporarily stop omeprazole at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels. ( 5.11 , 7 ) Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of omeprazole ( 5.12 , 7 ) . Fundic Gland Polyps: Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with omeprazole does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis ( TIN ) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions, to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function ( e.g. , malaise, nausea, anorexia ) . In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations ( e.g. , fever, rash or arthralgia ) . Discontinue omeprazole delayed-release capsules and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like omeprazole may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents ( clarithromycin and amoxicillin ) indicated for use in combination with omeprazole, refer to Warnings and Precautions sections of the corresponding prescribing information. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy ( a year or longer ) . Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6.3 ) ] . 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) have been reported in association with the use of PPIs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3 ) ] . Discontinue omeprazole delayed-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( CLE ) and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including omeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE ( SCLE ) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving omeprazole, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing ( e.g. , ANA ) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.7 Interaction with Clopidogrel Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as omeprazole, that inhibit CYP2 C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 80 mg omeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel, even when administered 12 hours apart. When using omeprazole, consider alternative anti-platelet therapy [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 5.8 Cyanocobalamin ( Vitamin B-12 ) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time ( e.g. , longer than 3 years ) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin ( vitamin B-12 ) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with omeprazole. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia ( e.g. , diuretics ) , health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of omeprazole delayed-release capsules and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia ( e.g. , hypoparathyroidism ) . Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI. 5.10 Interaction with St John’s Wort or Rifampin Drugs which induce CYP2 C19 or CYP3 A4 ( such as St. John’s Wort or rifampin ) can substantially decrease omeprazole concentrations [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole with St. John’s Wort or rifampin. 5.11 Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A ( CgA ) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop omeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed ( e.g. , for monitoring ) , the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . 5.12 Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate ( primarily at high dose ) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . 5.13 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPIs users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.",
  "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling: • Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] • Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] • Bone Fracture [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] • Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] • Cyanocobalamin ( Vitamin B-12 ) Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] • Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] • Fundic Gland Polyps [seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5.13 ) ] Adults: Most common adverse reactions in adults ( incidence ≥2% ) are • Headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence ( 6 ) Pediatric patients ( 2 to 16 years of age ) : • Safety profile similar to that in adults, except that respiratory system events and fever were the most frequently reported reactions in pediatric studies. ( 8.4 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Inc. , at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience with Omeprazole Monotherapy Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflects exposure to omeprazole delayed-release capsules in 3096 patients from worldwide clinical trials ( 465 patients from U.S. studies and 2.631 patients from international studies ) . Indications clinically studied in U.S. trials included duodenal ulcer, resistant ulcer, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The international clinical trials were double blind and open-label in design. The most common adverse reactions reported ( i.e. , with an incidence rate ≥2% ) from omeprazole-treated patients enrolled in these studies included headache ( 7% ) , abdominal pain ( 5% ) , nausea ( 4% ) , diarrhea ( 4% ) , vomiting ( 3% ) , and flatulence ( 3% ) . Additional adverse reactions that were reported with an incidence ≥1% included acid regurgitation ( 2% ) , upper respiratory infection ( 2% ) , constipation ( 2% ) , dizziness ( 2% ) , rash ( 2% ) , asthenia ( 1% ) , back pain ( 1% ) , and cough ( 1% ) . The clinical trial safety profile in patients greater than 65 years of age was similar to that in patients 65 years of age or less. The clinical trial safety profile in pediatric patients who received omeprazole delayed-release capsules was similar to that in adult patients. Unique to the pediatric population, however, adverse reactions of the respiratory system were frequently reported in the 2 to 16 year age group ( 19% ) . In addition, accidental injuries were frequently reported in the 2 to 16 year age group ( 4% ) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) ] . 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience with Omeprazole in Combination Therapy for H. pylori Eradication In clinical trials using either dual therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin, or triple therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin, no adverse reactions unique to these drug combinations were observed. Adverse reactions observed were limited to those previously reported with omeprazole, clarithromycin, or amoxicillin alone. Dual Therapy ( omeprazole/clarithromycin ) Adverse reactions observed in controlled clinical trials using combination therapy with omeprazole and clarithromycin ( n = 346 ) that differed from those previously described for omeprazole alone were taste perversion ( 15% ) , tongue discoloration ( 2% ) , rhinitis ( 2% ) , pharyngitis ( 1% ) and flu-syndrome ( 1% ) . ( For more information on clarithromycin, refer to the clarithromycin prescribing information, Adverse Reactions section. ) Triple Therapy ( omeprazole/clarithromycin/amoxicillin ) The most frequent adverse reactions observed in clinical trials using combination therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin ( n = 274 ) were diarrhea ( 14% ) , taste perversion ( 10% ) , and headache ( 7% ) . None of these occurred at a higher frequency than that reported by patients taking antimicrobial agents alone. ( For more information on clarithromycin or amoxicillin, refer to the respective prescribing information, Adverse Reactions sections. ) 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of omeprazole. Because these reactions are voluntarily reported from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their actual frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body As a Whole: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, interstitial nephritis, urticaria, ( see also Skin below ) ; fever; pain; fatigue; malaise; systemic lupus erythematosus Cardiovascular: Chest pain or angina, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations, elevated blood pressure, peripheral edema Endocrine: Gynecomastia Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis ( some fatal ) , anorexia, irritable colon, fecal discoloration, esophageal candidiasis, mucosal atrophy of the tongue, stomatitis, abdominal swelling, dry mouth, microscopic colitis, fundic gland polyps. Gastroduodenal carcinoids have been reported in patients with ZE syndrome on long-term treatment with omeprazole. This finding is believed to be a manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with such tumors. Hepatic: Liver disease including hepatic failure ( some fatal ) , liver necrosis ( some fatal ) , hepatic encephalopathy hepatocellular disease, cholestatic disease, mixed hepatitis, jaundice, and elevations of liver function tests [ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin] Infections and Infestations: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea Metabolism and Nutritional disorders: Hypoglycemia, hypomagnesemia, with or without hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia, hyponatremia, weight gain [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] .
