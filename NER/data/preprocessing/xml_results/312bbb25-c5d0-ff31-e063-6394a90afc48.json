    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "PRECAUTIONS General Discontinue treatment with nystatin if sensitization or irritation is reported during use. Nystatin is not effective in the treatment of systemic mycoses since it is not significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Information for the Patient Patient should be advised to retain nystatin in the mouth as long as possible and to continue its use for at least 2 days after symptoms have subsided. There should be no interruption or discontinuation of the medication until the prescribed course of treatment is completed, even though symptomatic relief may occur within a few days. If symptoms of local irritation develop, the physician should be notified immediately. Laboratory Tests If there is a lack of therapeutic response, appropriate microbiological studies (e.g., KOH smears and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis of candidiasis and rule out other pathogens before instituting another course of therapy. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of nystatin. In mice exposed to nystatin 50 mg/kg by injection, an increased incidence of chromosomal aberrations, consisting primarily of chromatid breaks, was observed in bone marrow cells. However, there have been no studies to determine the mutagenicity of orally-administered nystatin or its effects on fertility in males or females. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects - Pregnancy Category C Teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with nystatin. It is also not known whether nystatin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Nystatin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nonteratogenic effects In one rat reproductive study, nystatin was administered orally to pregnant rats in single doses of 100, 500, or 3000 mg/kg on the ninth day of gestation, or as multiple doses of 500 mg/kg/day on gestation days 1-20, 1-4, 7-10, 11-14, or 15-18. It was found that nystatin had a slight abortive effect when used during the whole period of pregnancy. No abnormalities were seen in surviving fetuses. Although no adverse effects or complications have been attributed to the use of intra-vaginal nystatin in neonates born to women treated during pregnancy, no similar studies evaluating complications of oral nystatin have been conducted. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether nystatin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when nystatin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section for pediatric dosing recommendations.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, gastrointestinal distress, nausea, vomiting and burning of the mouth have been reported. Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, and anaphylactoid reaction have also been reported."
