( 5.1 ) \u2022 Reversible diabetes insipidus ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Worsening Cardiac Function A decrease in cardiac index may be observed with the use of vasopressin. 5.2 Reversible Diabetes Insipidus Patients may experience reversible diabetes insipidus, manifested by the development of polyuria, a dilute urine, and hypernatremia, after cessation of treatment with vasopressin. Monitor serum electrolytes, fluid status and urine output after vasopressin discontinuation. Some patients may require readministration of vasopressin or administration of desmopressin to correct fluid and electrolyte shifts.",

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bleeding/lymphatic system disorders: Hemorrhagic shock, decreased platelets, intractable bleeding Cardiac disorders: Right heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, myocardial ischemia Gastrointestinal disorders: Mesenteric ischemia Hepatobiliary: Increased bilirubin levels Renal/urinary disorders: Acute renal insufficiency Vascular disorders: Distal limb ischemia Metabolic: Hyponatremia Skin: Ischemic lesions Postmarketing Experience Reversible diabetes insipidus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. The most common adverse reactions include decreased cardiac output, bradycardia, tachyarrhythmias, hyponatremia and ischemia (coronary, mesenteric, skin, digital).
