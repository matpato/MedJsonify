POMALYST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Pomalidomide is a thalidomide analogue and is teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of organogenesis. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 4.2 Hypersensitivity POMALYST is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, anaphylaxis) to pomalidomide or any of the excipients [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Description (11) ]",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5\tWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Increased Mortality: Observed in patients with MM when pembrolizumab was added to dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue ( 5.4 ). \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity: Neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3/4 adverse event. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia ( 5.5 ). \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure including fatalities; monitor liver function tests monthly ( 5.6 ). \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Discontinue POMALYST for severe reactions ( 5.7 ). \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): Monitor patients at risk of TLS (i.e., those with high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions ( 5.11 ). \u2022 Hypersensitivity: Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity. Discontinue POMALYST for angioedema and anaphylaxis ( 5.12 ). 5.1\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity POMALYST is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . POMALYST is only available through PS-Pomalidomide REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning POMALYST therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with POMALYST, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of POMALYST therapy. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing POMALYST therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles, or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Males Pomalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking POMALYST and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing POMALYST, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking POMALYST must not donate sperm [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with POMALYST and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to POMALYST. 5.2\tPS-Pomalidomide REMS Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] , POMALYST is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), \"PS-Pomalidomide REMS\" . Required components of PS-Pomalidomide REMS include the following: \u2022 Prescribers must be certified with PS-Pomalidomide REMS by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. \u2022 Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] . \u2022 Pharmacies must be certified with PS-Pomalidomide REMS , must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive POMALYST and comply with REMS requirements. Further information about PS-Pomalidomide REMS is available at www.PS-PomalidomideREMS.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436. 5.3\tVenous and Arterial Thromboembolism Venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction and stroke) have been observed in patients treated with POMALYST. In Trial 2, where anticoagulant therapies were mandated, thromboembolic events occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and low dose-dexamethasone (Low-dose Dex), and 3.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurred in 4.7% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone.  Arterial thromboembolic events include terms for arterial thromboembolic events, ischemic cerebrovascular conditions, and ischemic heart disease. Arterial thromboembolic events occurred in 3.0% of patients treated with POMALYST and Low-dose Dex, and 1.3% of patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk, and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended, and the choice of regimen should be based on assessment of the patient's underlying risk factors. 5.4\tIncreased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. 5.5\tHematologic Toxicity Multiple Myeloma In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, neutropenia was the most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction, followed by anemia and thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia of any grade was reported in 51% of patients in both trials. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 46%. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 8%. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially neutropenia. Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter.  Patients may require dose interruption and/or modification [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] Kaposi Sarcoma In Trial 12-C-0047, hematologic toxicities were the most common (all grades and Grade 3 or 4) adverse reactions [see . Fifty percent of patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia. Monitor patients for hematologic toxicities, especially decreased neutrophils. Monitor complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 12 weeks and monthly thereafter. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue POMALYST based on the severity of the reaction Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] 5.6\tHepatotoxicity Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with POMALYST. Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin have also been observed in patients treated with POMALYST. Monitor liver function tests monthly. Stop POMALYST upon elevation of liver enzymes and evaluate. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered. 5.7 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. These reactions can be fatal. Consider POMALYST interruption or discontinuation for Grade 2 or 3 skin rash. Permanently discontinue POMALYST for Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS, TEN or DRESS [see . Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] 5.8\tDizziness and Confusional State In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, 14% of patients experienced dizziness and 7% of patients experienced a confusional state; 1% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 dizziness, and 3% of patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 confusional state. Instruct patients to avoid situations where dizziness or confusional state may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause dizziness or confusional state without adequate medical advice. 5.9\tNeuropathy In trials 1 and 2 in patients who received POMALYST + Low-dose Dex, 18% of patients experienced neuropathy, with approximately 12% of the patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy. Two percent of patients experienced Grade 3 neuropathy in trial 2. There were no cases of Grade 4 neuropathy adverse reactions reported in either trial. 5.10 Risk of Second Primary Malignancies Cases of acute myelogenous leukemia have been reported in patients receiving POMALYST as an investigational therapy outside of MM. 5.11 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients treated with POMALYST. Patients at risk for TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. These patients should be monitored closely and appropriate precautions taken. 5.12 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic reactions to POMALYST have been reported. Permanently discontinue POMALYST for angioedema or anaphylaxis [see . Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]",

Multiple Myeloma (MM) In Trial 1, data were evaluated from 219 patients (safety population) who received treatment with POMALYST + Low-dose Dex (112 patients) or POMALYST alone (107 patients). Median number of treatment cycles was 5. Sixty-seven percent of patients in the study had a dose interruption of either drug due to adverse reactions. Forty-two percent of patients in the study had a dose reduction of either drug due to adverse reactions. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11%. In Trial 2, data were evaluated from 450 patients (safety population) who received treatment with POMALYST + Low-dose Dex (300 patients) or High-dose Dexamethasone (High-dose Dex) (150 patients). The median number of treatment cycles for the POMALYST + Low-dose Dex arm was 5. In the POMALYST + Low-dose Dex arm, 67% of patients had a dose interruption of POMALYST, the median time to the first dose interruption of POMALYST was 4.1 weeks. Twenty-seven percent of patients had a dose reduction of POMALYST, the median time to the first dose reduction of POMALYST was 4.5 weeks. Eight percent of patients discontinued POMALYST due to adverse reactions. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the adverse reactions reported in Trials 1 and 2, respectively. Table 3:\t Adverse Reactions in Any POMALYST Treatment Arm in Trial 1* * Regardless of attribution of relatedness to POMALYST. a POMALYST alone arm includes all patients randomized to the POMALYST alone arm who took study drug; 61 of the 107 patients had dexamethasone added during the treatment period. b Serious adverse reactions were reported in at least 2 patients in any POMALYST treatment arm.

Across all patients treated on Trial 12-C-0047, 75% were exposed to pomalidomide for 6 months or longer and 25% were exposed for greater than one year. Clinical Studies (14.2) ] Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% (5/28) of patients who received POMALYST. The following serious adverse reactions each occurred in 1 patient: anemia, decreased neutrophil count, and hematuria. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% (3/28) of patients who received POMALYST. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% (4/28) of patients who received POMALYST. The most frequent adverse reaction requiring dosage interruption was decreased neutrophil count, which occurred in 3 patients. The POMALYST dose was reduced due to an adverse reaction in 1 patient due to gout. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the adverse reactions and select laboratory abnormalities reported in Trial 12-C-0047.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Pancytopenia Endocrine Disorders: Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism Gastrointestinal Disorders: Gastrointestinal hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatic failure (including fatal cases), elevated liver enzymes Immune system Disorders: Allergic reactions (e.g., angioedema, anaphylaxis, urticaria), solid organ transplant rejection Infections and Infestations: Hepatitis B virus reactivation, Herpes zoster, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps): Tumor lysis syndrome, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)",
