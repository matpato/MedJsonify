    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increases in Blood Pressure : Can increase blood pressure in adult or pediatric patients. Periodically monitor blood pressure, especially in hypertensive patients. MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules are not recommended in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention in Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction and in Patients Taking Muscarinic Antagonist Drugs for Overactive Bladder : Administer with caution in these patients because of risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) Angioedema : Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with mirabegron. ( 5.3 , 6.2 ) 5.1 Increases in Blood Pressure Increases in Blood Pressure in Adults MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules can increase blood pressure. Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended, especially in hypertensive patients. MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules is not recommended for use in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension ( defined as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg ) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.2 ) ] In two, randomized, placebo-controlled, healthy adult volunteer studies, MYRBETRIQ was associated with dose-related increases in supine blood pressure. In these studies, at the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg, the mean maximum increase in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was approximately 3.5/1.5 mm Hg greater than placebo. In contrast, in adult OAB patients in clinical trials, MYRBETRIQ, taken as monotherapy or in combination with solifenacin succinate 5 mg, the mean increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the maximum recommended mirabegron dose of 50 mg was approximately 0.5 to 1 mm Hg greater than placebo. Worsening of pre-existing hypertension was reported infrequently in patients taking MYRBETRIQ. Increases in Blood Pressure in Pediatric Patients 3 Years and Older MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules can increase blood pressure in pediatric patients. Blood pressure increases may be larger in children ( 3 to less than 12 years of age ) than in adolescents ( 12 to less than 18 years of age ) . Periodic blood pressure determinations are recommended. MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules is not recommended for use in pediatric patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension, defined as a systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure above the 99 th percentile plus 5 mm Hg for age, sex, and stature using appropriate referencevalues [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 ) ] 5.2 Urinary Retention in Patients with Bladder Outlet Obstruction and in Patients Taking Muscarinic Antagonist Medications for OAB In patients taking MYRBETRIQ, urinary retention has been reported to occur in patients with bladder outlet obstruction ( BOO ) and in patients taking muscarinic antagonist medications for the treatment of OAB. A controlled clinical safety study in patients with BOO did not demonstrate increased urinary retention in patients treated with mirabegron; however, MYRBETRIQ should still be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant BOO. For example, monitor these patients for signs and symptoms of urinary retention. MYRBETRIQ should also be administered with caution to patients taking muscarinic antagonist medications for the treatment of OAB, including solifenacin succinate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.2 ) ] 5.3 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose, however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema, associated with upper airway swelling, may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, promptly discontinue MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 ) ] 5.4 Patients Taking Drugs Metabolized by CYP2 D6 Since MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules is a moderate CYP2 D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure to CYP2 D6 substrates is increased when coadministered with MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary, especially with narrow therapeutic index drugs metabolized by CYP2 D6 [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Urinary Retention [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Most commonly reported adverse reactions with MYRBETRIQ monotherapy in adult patients with OAB ( > 2% and > placebo ) were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and headache. ( 6.1 ) Most commonly reported adverse reactions with MYRBETRIQ, in combination with solifenacin succinate in adult patients with OAB ( > 2% and > placebo and > comparator ) , were dry mouth, urinary tract infection, constipation, and tachycardia. ( 6.1 ) Most commonly reported adverse reactions with MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules in pediatric patients with NDO ( \u2265 3% ) were UTI, nasopharyngitis, constipation, and headache.

MYRBETRIQ Monotherapy for Adult OAB In three, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety and efficacy studies in patients with OAB ( Studies 1, 2, and 3 ) , MYRBETRIQ was evaluated for safety in 2736 patients [see Clinical Studies ( . Study 1 also included an active control. For the combined Studies 1, 2, and 3, 432 patients received MYRBETRIQ 25 mg, 1375 received MYRBETRIQ 50 mg, and 929 received MYRBETRIQ 100 mg once daily. In these studies, the majority of the patients were Caucasian ( 94% ) and female ( 72% ) with a mean age of 59 years ( range 18 to 95 years ) . 14.1 ) ] MYRBETRIQ was also evaluated for safety in 1632 patients who received MYRBETRIQ 50 mg once daily ( n=812 patients ) or MYRBETRIQ 100 mg ( n=820 patients ) in a 1-year, randomized, fixed-dose, double-blind, active-controlled, safety study in patients with OAB ( Study 4 ) . Of these patients, 731 received MYRBETRIQ in a previous 12-week study. In Study 4, 1385 patients received MYRBETRIQ continuously for at least 6 months, 1311 patients received MYRBETRIQ for at least 9 months, and 564 patients received MYRBETRIQ for at least 1 year. The most frequent adverse events ( 0.2% ) leading to discontinuation in Studies 1, 2, and 3 for the 25 mg or 50 mg dose were nausea, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, and tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation ( 0.2% ) and prostate cancer ( 0.1% ) were reported as serious adverse events by more than 1 patient and at a rate greater than placebo. Table 8 lists the adverse reactions, derived from all adverse events, that were reported in Studies 1, 2, and 3 at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with MYRBETRIQ 25 mg or 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. The most commonly reported adverse reactions ( greater than 2% of MYRBETRIQ patients and greater than placebo ) were hypertension, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and headache.

Serious adverse events reported by at least 2 patients and exceeding active control included cerebrovascular accident ( 0.4% ) and osteoarthritis ( 0.2% ) . Serum ALT/AST increased from baseline by greater than 10-fold in 2 patients ( 0.3% ) taking MYRBETRIQ 50 mg; and these markers subsequently returned to baseline while both patients continued MYRBETRIQ. In Study 4, serious adverse events of neoplasm were reported by 0.1% , 1.3% , and 0.5% of patients treated with MYRBETRIQ 50 mg, MYRBETRIQ 100 mg, and active control once daily, respectively. Neoplasms reported by 2 patients treated with MYRBETRIQ 100 mg included breast cancer, lung neoplasm malignant, and prostate cancer. A causal relationship between mirabegron and these reported neoplasms has not been established. In a separate clinical study in Japan, a single case was reported as Stevens-Johnson syndrome with increased serum ALT, AST, and bilirubin in a patient taking MYRBETRIQ 100 mg as well as an herbal medication ( Kyufu Gold ) . MYRBETRIQ Combination Therapy with Solifenacin Succinate for Adult OAB In three, 12-week, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled safety and efficacy studies in patients with OAB ( Studies 5, 6, and 7 ) , combination treatment of MYRBETRIQ and solifenacin succinate was evaluated for safety in 6818 patients [see Clinical Studies ( . Studies 5 and 6 also included a placebo control. For the combined Studies 5, 6, and 7, 997 patients received combination treatment with MYRBETRIQ 25 mg and solifenacin succinate 5 mg, and 1706 patients received combination treatment with MYRBETRIQ 50 mg and solifenacin succinate 5 mg. In these studies, the majority of the patients were Caucasian ( 88% ) and female ( 77% ) with a mean age of 57 years ( range 18 to 89 years ) . 14.2 ) ] MYRBETRIQ 50 mg and solifenacin succinate 5 mg coadministration was also evaluated for safety in 1814 patients in a 52-week, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled study in patients with OAB ( Study 8 ) [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.2 ) ] In Studies 5, 6, and 7, the most commonly reported adverse reactions ( greater than 2% of patients treated with combination therapy of MYRBETRIQ and solifenacin succinate 5 mg, and greater than placebo and/or MYRBETRIQ or solifenacin succinate comparator at the same dose as in the combination treatment ) were dry mouth, urinary tract infection, constipation, and tachycardia. The most frequent adverse reactions ( \u2265 0.2% ) leading to discontinuation in the coadministration trials were dry mouth and urinary retention. Table 10 lists the adverse reactions, derived from all adverse events that were reported in Studies 5, 6, and 7 in 1% or more of patients treated with MYRBETRIQ 25 mg or 50 mg coadministered with solifenacin succinate 5 mg and at an incidence greater than placebo and mirabegron or solifenacin succinate comparator at the same dose as in the combination treatment when administered once daily for up to 12 weeks.

The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the trial were constipation ( 0.2% ) , urinary retention ( 0.2% ) , urinary hesitation ( 0.2% ) , and vision blurred ( 0.2% ) . In Study 8, serious adverse events of neoplasm were reported by 0.7% , 0.3% , and 0% of patients who received coadministration of MYRBETRIQ 50 mg and solifenacin succinate 5 mg, MYRBETRIQ 50 mg monotherapy, and solifenacin succinate 5 mg monotherapy, respectively. Neoplasms reported by more than 1 patient who received coadministration with MYRBETRIQ 50 mg and solifenacin succinate 5 mg included basal cell carcinoma ( n=3 ) , breast cancer ( n=2 ) , melanoma ( n=2 ) , and squamous cell carcinoma ( n=2 ) . A causal relationship between the coadministration of mirabegron and solifenacin succinate and these reported neoplasms has not been established. Table 11 lists the adverse reactions, derived from all adverse events that were reported at an incidence greater than comparator and in 2% or more of patients treated with MYRBETRIQ 50 mg coadministered with solifenacin succinate 5 mg once daily for up to 52 weeks in Study 8.

The study included 86 pediatric patients 3 to 17 years of age with neurogenic detrusor overactivity ( NDO ) ; 55% were female, 72% were White. Treatment was initiated at the weight-based starting recommended dose and was increased to a dose equivalent of MYRBETRIQ 50 mg daily dose in adults by Week 8. Subsequent to the dose titration period, patients continued their optimized dose for the duration of the 52-week study ( mean exposure duration 303 days, range 1 to 390 days ) . 14.3 ) ] The most commonly reported adverse reactions were UTI, nasopharyngitis, constipation, and headache. Table 12 lists the adverse reactions that were reported in 2% or more of patients treated with MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules for oral suspension in Study 9. Table 12: Percentages of Patients with Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% of Patients 3 to 17 Years of Age with Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity ( NDO ) Treated with MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules in Study 9 Adverse Reaction Percentage ( % ) of Patients Reporting Adverse Reactions N=86 Number of Patients 51 ( 59.3 ) Urinary Tract Infection Includes any recorded UTI while patient was on treatment with MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules. 24.4 Nasopharyngitis 5.8 Constipation 4.7 Headache 3.5 Nausea 2.3 Gastroenteritis 2.3 Rhinitis 2.3 Cough 2.3 Increased Blood Pressure in Pediatric Patients with NDO Treated with MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules: Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased in Study 9 by 4.3 mm Hg and 1.7 mm Hg, respectively, in patients less than 12 years of age on MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules at a dose equivalent of MYRBETRIQ 50 mg daily dose in adults. The blood pressure increases were larger in patients less than 8 years of age with mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure increases of 5.9 mm Hg and 2.3 mm Hg, respectively. Ten ( 24% ) patients less than 12 years of age who were normotensive at baseline had at least one blood pressure measured at or above the 95 th percentile for age, sex, and stature during Study 9. Stage 1 hypertension, defined as repeated blood pressure measurements at or above the 95 th percentile for age, sex, and stature, was sustained in six of these 10 patients ( 60% ) at the end of the study. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MYRBETRIQ/MYRBETRIQ Granules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following events have been reported in association with mirabegron use in worldwide postmarketing experience: Cardiac disorders : atrial fibrillation Gastrointestinal disorders : nausea, constipation, diarrhea Nervous system disorders : dizziness, headache There have been postmarketing reports of confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, and anxiety in patients taking mirabegron. The majority of these patients had pre-existing medical conditions or concomitant medications that may cause confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, and anxiety. A causal relationship between mirabegron and these disorders has not been established.
