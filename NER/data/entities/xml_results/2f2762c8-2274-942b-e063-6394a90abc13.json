PROLENSA is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for the treatment of postoperative inflammation and reduction of ocular pain in patients who have undergone cataract surgery.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Sulfite Allergic Reactions ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Slow or Delayed Healing ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Potential for Cross-Sensitivity ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Increased Bleeding Time ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Keratitis and Corneal Reactions ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Sulfite Allergic Reactions PROLENSA contains sodium sulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people. 5.2 Slow or Delayed Healing All topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including bromfenac, may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. 5.3 Potential for Cross-Sensitivity There is the potential for cross-sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid, phenylacetic acid derivatives, and other NSAIDs, including bromfenac. Therefore, caution should be used when treating individuals who have previously exhibited sensitivities to these drugs. 5.4 Increased Bleeding Time With some NSAIDs, including bromfenac, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with platelet aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied NSAIDs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphemas) in conjunction with ocular surgery. It is recommended that PROLENSA ophthalmic solution be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications which may prolong bleeding time. 5.5 Keratitis and Corneal Reactions Use of topical NSAIDs, including bromfenac, may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs, including bromfenac, and should be closely monitored for corneal health. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 24 hours prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days postsurgery may increase patient risk for the occurrence and severity of corneal adverse events. 5.6 Risk of Contamination Do not touch dropper tip to the eye, eyelids, or to any surface, as this may contaminate the contents. Replace the bottle cap after using. 5.7 Contact Lens Wear PROLENSA should not be instilled while wearing contact lenses. Remove contact lenses prior to instillation of PROLENSA. The preservative in PROLENSA, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Lenses may be reinserted after 10 minutes following administration of PROLENSA.",

The most commonly reported adverse reactions following use of PROLENSA following cataract surgery include: anterior chamber inflammation, foreign body sensation, eye pain, photophobia, and vision blurred. These reactions were reported in 3% to 8% of patients.",
