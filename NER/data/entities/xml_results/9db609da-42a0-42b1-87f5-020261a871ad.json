If contact lenses are worn, they should be removed prior to administration of the solution. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of CEQUA ophthalmic solution.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions following the use of CEQUA (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution) 0.09% was instillation site pain (22%) and conjunctival hyperemia (6%) ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-406-7984 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, 769 subjects received at least 1 dose of cyclosporine ophthalmic solution. The majority of the treated subjects were female (83%). The most common adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of subjects were pain on instillation of drops (22%) and conjunctival hyperemia (6%). Other adverse reactions reported in 1% to 5% of the patients were blepharitis, eye irritation, headache, and urinary tract infection.",
