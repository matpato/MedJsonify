            "text": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Males Testosterone enanthate injection is indicated for replacement therapy in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. \u2013 Testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, or orchidectomy. Primary hypogonadism ( congenital or acquired ) \u2013 Gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) deficiency, or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. ( Appropriate adrenal cortical and thyroid hormone replacement therapy are still necessary, however, and are actually of primary importance. ) Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( congenital or acquired ) If the above conditions occur prior to puberty, androgen replacement therapy will be needed during the adolescent years for development of secondary sexual characteristics. Prolonged androgen treatment will be required to maintain sexual characteristics in these and other males who develop testosterone deficiency after puberty. Safety and efficacy of testosterone enanthate injection in men with age-related hypogonadism have not been established. \u2013 Testosterone enanthate injection may be used to stimulate puberty in carefully selected males with clearly delayed puberty. These patients usually have a familial pattern of delayed puberty that is not secondary to a pathological disorder; puberty is expected to occur spontaneously at a relatively late date. Brief treatment with conservative doses may occasionally be justified in these patients if they do not respond to psychological support. The potential adverse effect on bone maturation should be discussed with the patient and parents prior to androgen administration. An X-ray of the hand and wrist to determine bone age should be obtained every six months to assess the effect of treatment on the epiphyseal centers ( see Delayed puberty ) . WARNINGS Females \u2013 Testosterone enanthate injection may be used secondarily in women with advancing inoperable metastatic ( skeletal ) mammary cancer who are one to five years postmenopausal. Primary goals of therapy in these women include ablation of the ovaries. Other methods of counteracting estrogen activity are adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy, and/or antiestrogen therapy. This treatment has also been used in premenopausal women with breast cancer who have benefited from oophorectomy and are considered to have a hormone-responsive tumor. Judgment concerning androgen therapy should be made by an oncologist with expertise in this field. Metastatic mammary cancer",

            "text": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Androgens are contraindicated in men with carcinomas of the breast or with known or suspected carcinomas of the prostate and in women who are or may become pregnant. When administered to pregnant women, androgens cause virilization of the external genitalia of the female fetus. This virilization includes clitoromegaly, abnormal vaginal development, and fusion of genital folds to form a scrotal-like structure. The degree of masculinization is related to the amount of drug given and the age of the fetus and is most likely to occur in the female fetus when the drugs are given in the first trimester. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking androgens, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. This preparation is also contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its components.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS In patients with breast cancer and in immobilized patients, androgen therapy may cause hypercalcemia by stimulating osteolysis. In patients with cancer, hypercalcemia may indicate progression of bony metastasis. If hypercalcemia occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted. Prolonged use of high doses of androgens has been associated with the development of peliosis hepatis and hepatic neoplasms including hepatocellular carcinoma ( see ) . Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis If cholestatic hepatitis with jaundice appears or if liver function tests become abnormal, the androgen should be discontinued and the etiology should be determined. Drug-induced jaundice is reversible when the medication is discontinued. Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma. There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone enanthate. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone enanthate and initiate appropriate workup and management . Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) , such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone enanthate. Testosterone products can increase cardiovascular ( CV ) risk over time. Monitor blood pressure periodically in men using testosterone products, especially in men with hypertension. Testosterone products are not recommended for use in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions ( see ) . DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range. However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events. Due to sodium and water retention, edema with or without congestive heart failure may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. In addition to discontinuation of the drug, diuretic therapy may be required. If the administration of testosterone enanthate is restarted, a lower dose should be used. Gynecomastia frequently develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism. Androgen therapy should be used cautiously in healthy males with delayed puberty. The effect on bone maturation should be monitored by assessing bone age of the wrist and hand every six months. In children, androgen treatment may accelerate bone maturation without producing compensatory gain in linear growth. This adverse effect may result in compromised adult stature. The younger the child the greater the risk of compromising final mature height.PRECAUTIONS General Women should be observed for signs of virilization ( deepening of the voice, hirsutism, acne, clitoromegaly, and menstrual irregularities ) . Discontinuation of drug therapy at the time of evidence of mild virilism is necessary to prevent irreversible virilization. Such virilization is usual following androgen use at high doses and is not prevented by concomitant use of estrogens. A decision may be made by the patient and the physician that some virilization will be tolerated during treatment for breast carcinoma. Because androgens may alter serum cholesterol concentration, caution should be used when administering these drugs to patients with a history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease. Serial determinations of serum cholesterol should be made and therapy adjusted accordingly. A causal relationship between myocardial infarction and hypercholesterolemia has not been established. Information for Patients Male adolescent patients receiving androgens for delayed puberty should have bone development checked every six months. The physician should instruct patients to report any of the following side effects of androgens: \u2013 too frequent or persistent erections of the penis. Adult or adolescent males \u2013 hoarseness, acne, changes in menstrual periods, or more facial hair. Women \u2013 any nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, or ankle swelling. All patients Geriatric Use Clinical studies of testosterone enanthate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects, aged 65 and older, to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Testosterone replacement is not indicated in geriatric patients who have age-related hypogonadism only ( \u201candropause\u201d ) , because there is insufficient safety and efficacy information to support such use. Current studies do not assess whether testosterone use increases risks of prostate cancer, prostate hyperplasia, and cardiovascular disease in the geriatric population. Intramuscular Administration When properly given, injections of testosterone enanthate are well tolerated. Care should be taken to slowly inject the preparation deeply into the gluteal muscle, being sure to follow the usual precautions for intramuscular administration, such as the avoidance of intravascular injection. There have been rare postmarketing reports of transient reactions involving urge to cough, coughing fits, and respiratory distress immediately after the injection of testosterone enanthate, an oil-based depot preparation ( see ) . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Laboratory Tests Women with disseminated breast carcinoma should have frequent determination of urine and serum calcium levels during the course of androgen therapy ( see ) . WARNINGS Periodic ( every six months ) X-ray examinations of bone age should be made during treatment of pre-pubertal males to determine the rate of bone maturation and the effects of androgen therapy on the epiphyseal centers. Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be checked periodically for polycythemia in patients who are receiving high doses of androgens. Drug Interactions When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with androgens: \u2013 C-17 substituted derivatives of testosterone, such as methandrostenolone, have been reported to decrease the anticoagulant requirement. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring especially when androgens are started or stopped. Anticoagulants, oral \u2013 In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and insulin requirements. Antidiabetic drugs and insulin \u2013 Enhanced tendency toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease. ACTH and corticosteroids \u2013 Elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone may result. Oxyphenbutazone Drug/Laboratory Test Interferences Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T 4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T 3 and T 4 . Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. Carcinogenesis Testosterone has been tested by subcutaneous injection and implantation in mice and rats. The implant induced cervical-uterine tumors in mice, which metastasized in some cases. There is suggestive evidence that injection of testosterone into some strains of female mice increases their susceptibility to hepatoma. Testosterone is also known to increase the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically induced carcinomas of the liver in rats. There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases. Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects Category X ( see ) . CONTRAINDICATIONS Nursing Mothers It is not known whether androgens are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from androgens, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Androgen therapy should be used very cautiously in pediatric patients and only by specialists who are aware of the adverse effects on bone maturation. Skeletal maturation must be monitored every six months by an X-ray of the hand and wrist ( see , and INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) . WARNINGS",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Endocrine and Urogenital, Female \u2013 The most common side effects of androgen therapy are amenorrhea and other menstrual irregularities, inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, and virilization, including deepening of the voice and clitoral enlargement. The latter usually is not reversible after androgens are discontinued. When administered to a pregnant woman, androgens cause virilization of the external genitalia of the female fetus. \u2013 Gynecomastia, and excessive frequency and duration of penile erections. Oligospermia may occur at high dosages ( see Male ) . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \u2013 Hirsutism, male pattern baldness, and acne. Skin and Appendages \u2013 myocardial infarction, stroke Cardiovascular Disorders \u2013 Retention of sodium, chloride, water, potassium, calcium ( see Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances ) , and inorganic phosphates. WARNINGS \u2013 Nausea, cholestatic jaundice, alterations in liver function tests; rarely, hepatocellular neoplasms, peliosis hepatis ( see Gastrointestinal ) . WARNINGS \u2013 Suppression of clotting factors II, V, VII, and X; bleeding in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy; polycythemia. Hematologic \u2013 Increased or decreased libido, headache, anxiety, depression, and generalized paresthesia. Nervous System \u2013 Increased serum cholesterol. Metabolic \u2013 venous thromboembolism Vascular Disorders \u2013 Rarely, anaphylactoid reactions; inflammation and pain at injection site. Miscellaneous",
