Limitations of use: The efficacy of FALMINA in women with a body mass index ( BMI ) of > 35 kg/m 2 has not been adequately evaluated. In a clinical trial with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 1.477 subjects had 7.720 cycles of use and a total of 5 pregnancies were reported. This represents an overall pregnancy rate of 0.84 per 100 woman-years. This rate includes patients who did not take the drug correctly. One or more pills were missed during 1.479 ( 18.8% ) of the 7.870 cycles; thus all tablets were taken during 6.391 ( 81.2% ) of the 7.870 cycles. Of the total 7.870 cycles, a total of 150 cycles were excluded from the calculation of the Pearl index due to the use of backup contraception and/or missing 3 or more consecutive pills. The mean BMI of the study population was 24 kg/m 2 . Females with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m 2 accounted for 12.1% ( n=179 ) of the study population. Females with a BMI over 35 kg/m 2 accounted for 4.3% ( n=63 ) of the study population.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS WARNING: CIGARETTE SMOKING AND SERIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combined oral contraceptives ( COC ) use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, COCs, including FALMINA, are contraindicated in women who are over 35 years of age and smoke.PRECAUTIONS 1. General Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV ( AIDS ) and other sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis. This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 ( tartrazine ) which may cause allergic-type reactions ( including bronchial asthma ) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 ( tartrazine ) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity. 2. Physical Examination and Follow-Up A periodic personal and family medical history and complete physical examination are appropriate for all women, including women using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, pelvic organs, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate diagnostic measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care. 3. Lipid Disorders Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult. ( See ) WARNINGS A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while taking oral contraceptives. Nonhormonal contraception should be considered in women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. Persistent hypertriglyceridemia may occur in a small population of combination oral contraceptive users. Elevations of plasma triglycerides may lead to pancreatitis and other complications. 4. Liver Function If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. 5. Fluid Retention Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention. 6. Depression Monitor females with a history of depression and discontinue FALMINA if depression recurs to a serious degree. Data on the association of CHCs with onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited. 7. Contact Lenses Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist. 8. Gastrointestinal Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption resulting in decreased serum concentrations. If a patient vomits or has diarrhea after taking an active tablet, instruct the patient to not take an additional active tablet on that day and to continue the regimen the next day as prescribed. In case of vomiting or diarrhea that continues for 48 hours or greater, instruct the patient to contact the health care provider and use back-up or alternative contraception until active tablets have been taken for 7 consecutive days after vomiting and diarrhea have resolved. 9. Drug Interactions Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy-Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co-administer FALMINA with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations ( see ) . WARINGS , RISK OF LIVER ENZYME ELEVATIONS WITH CONCOMITANT HEPATITIS C TREATMENT Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Coadministration of Other Products: Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, rifabutin, barbiturates, primidone, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin, and modafinil. In such cases a back-up nonhormonal method of birth control should be considered. Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes ( increase and decrease ) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. Herbal products containing St. John's Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) may induce hepatic enzymes ( cytochrome P 450 ) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Increase in Plasma Levels Associated with Co-Administered Drugs: Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increases AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20% . Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen increase the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol since these drugs act as competitive inhibitors for sulfation of ethinyl estradiol in the gastrointestinal wall, a known pathway of elimination for ethinyl estradiol. CYP 3 A4 inhibitors such as indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and troleandomycin may increase plasma hormone levels. Troleandomycin may also increase the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis during coadministration with combination oral contraceptives. Changes in Plasma Levels of Co-Administered Drugs: Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens ( eg, ethinyl estradiol ) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, prednisolone and other corticosteroids, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation ( particularly glucuronidation ) , have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives. Concomitant use of FALMINA may decrease lamotrigine exposure, which may reduce efficacy of lamotrigine. Adjust lamotrigine dosage as recommended in its Prescribing Information based on FALMINA initiation or discontinuation. Concomitant use of FALMINA may increase thyroid-binding globulin concentration. Monitor thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) level and follow the recommendation for the thyroid hormone in accordance with its Prescribing Information. The prescribing information of concomitant medications should be consulted to identify potential interactions. 10. Interactions with Laboratory Tests Certain endocrine- and liver-function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives: a. Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability. b. Increased thyroid-binding globulin ( TBG ) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine ( PBI ) , T 4 by column or by radioimmunoassay. c. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum i.e. , corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) , sex hormone-binding globulins ( SHBG ) leading to increased levels of total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids respectively. d. Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected. e. Glucose tolerance may be decreased. f. Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral-contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives. 11. Carcinogenesis See WARNINGS section. 12. Pregnancy Risk Summary There is no use for contraception in pregnancy; therefore, FALMINA should be discontinued during pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects ) following exposure to COCs before conception or during early pregnancy. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 percent and 15 to 20 percent, respectively. Data Human Data Epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects ) following exposure to COCs before conception or during early pregnancy. 13. Lactation Contraceptive hormones and metabolites are present in human milk. CHCs can reduce milk production in breast-feeding females. This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast-feeding is well-established. The developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for FALMINA and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from FALMINA or from the underlying maternal condition. 14. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets before menarche is not indicated. 15. Geriatric Use Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets have not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population. 16. Body Mass Index The safety and effectiveness of FALMINA in females with a BMI > 35 kg/m 2 have not been adequately evaluated. 17. Information for the Patient See Patient Labeling Printed Below.",

Five studies that compared breast cancer risk between ever-users ( current or past use ) of COCs and never-users of COCs reported no association between ever use of COCs and breast cancer risk, with effect estimates ranging from 0.90 - 1.12 ( Figure 2 ) . Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users ( <6 months since last use ) and never users of COCs ( Figure 2 ) . One of these studies reported no association between breast cancer risk and COC use. The other two studies found an increased relative risk of 1.19 - 1.33 with current or recent use. Both of these studies found an increased risk of breast cancer with current use of longer duration, with relative risks ranging from 1.03 with less than one year of COC use to approximately 1.4 with more than 8-10 years of COC use. FIGURE 2: Relevant Studies of Risk of Breast Cancer with Combined Oral Contraceptives RR = relative risk; OR = odds ratio; HR = hazard ratio. \u201cever COC\u201d are females with current or past COC use; \u201cnever COC use\u201d are females that never used COCs. The following adverse reactions associated with the use of oral CHCs were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Common adverse reactions associated with oral CHCs are headache, abdominal pain, nausea, metrorrhagia, vaginal moniliasis and pain, acne, and vaginitis. Additional adverse reactions that have been reported include the following: Eye disorder: intolerance to contact lenses, steepening of corneal curvature Gastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal bloating, vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions: Edema, fluid retention Hepatobiliary disorders: Cholestatic jaundice Pyschiatric disorders: Change in libido, mood changes Reproductive system and breast disorders: Amenorrhea, breast tenderness, breast pain, breast enlargement, increased cervical mucous, change in menstrual flow, unscheduled bleeding Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Acne, melasma Vascular disorders: Budd-Chiari syndrome, aggravation of varicose veins figure2",
