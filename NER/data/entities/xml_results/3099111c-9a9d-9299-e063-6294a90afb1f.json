    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Nausea : Patients may experience nausea; concomitant administration of food may reduce this symptom. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Diarrhea : Avoid use in patients with severe diarrhea. Instruct patients to discontinue lubiprostone and contact their healthcare provider if severe diarrhea occurs during treatment. ( 5.2 ) Syncope and Hypotension : May occur after taking the first dose or with subsequent doses. Generally resolves prior to the next dose, but may recur with repeat dosing. Instruct patients to discontinue lubiprostone and contact their healthcare provider if symptoms occur. ( 5.3 ) Dyspnea : May occur within an hour of first dose. Generally resolves within 3 hours, but may recur with repeat dosing. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if symptoms occur. ( 5.4 ) Bowel Obstruction : Evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction prior to initiating treatment with lubiprostone. ( 4 , 5.5 ) 5.1 Nausea Patients taking lubiprostone may experience nausea. Concomitant administration of food with lubiprostone may reduce symptoms of nausea [ see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.2 Diarrhea Avoid use of lubiprostone in patients with severe diarrhea. Patients should be aware of the possible occurrence of diarrhea during treatment. Instruct patients to discontinue lubiprostone and contact their healthcare provider if severe diarrhea occurs [ see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Syncope and Hypotension Syncope and hypotension have been reported with lubiprostone in the postmarketing setting and a few of these adverse reactions resulted in hospitalization. Most cases occurred in patients taking 24 mcg twice daily and some occurred within an hour after taking the first dose or subsequent doses of lubiprostone. Some patients had concomitant diarrhea or vomiting prior to developing the adverse reaction. Syncope and hypotension generally resolved following lubiprostone discontinuation or prior to next dose, but recurrence has been reported with subsequent doses. Several cases reported concomitant use of medications known to lower blood pressure, which may increase the risk for the development of syncope or hypotension. Patients should be aware of the risk of syncope and hypotension during treatment and that other adverse reactions may increase this risk, such as diarrhea or vomiting. 5.4 Dyspnea In clinical trials, dyspnea was reported by 3%, 1%, and < 1% of the treated CIC, OIC, and IBS-C populations receiving lubiprostone, respectively, compared to 0%, 1%, and < 1% of placebo-treated patients. There have been postmarketing reports of dyspnea when using lubiprostone 24 mcg twice daily. Some patients have discontinued treatment because of dyspnea. These events have usually been described as a sensation of chest tightness and difficulty taking in a breath, and generally have an acute onset within 30 to 60 minutes after taking the first dose. They generally resolve within a few hours after taking the dose, but recurrence has been frequently reported with subsequent doses. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider if dyspnea occurs. 5.5 Bowel Obstruction In patients with symptoms suggestive of mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction, perform a thorough evaluation to confirm the absence of an obstruction prior to initiating therapy with lubiprostone [see . Contraindication (4) ]",

( 6.1 ) OIC: nausea and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) IBS-C: nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-406-7984 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical development of lubiprostone for CIC, OIC, and IBS-C, 1648 patients were treated with lubiprostone for 6 months and 710 patients were treated for 1 year (not mutually exclusive). Chronic Idiopathic Constipation Adverse reactions in adult dose-finding, efficacy, and long-term clinical studies: The data described below reflect exposure to Lubiprostone 24 mcg twice daily in 1113 patients with CIC over 3- or 4-week, 6-month, and 12-month treatment periods; and from 316 patients receiving placebo over short-term exposure (\u22644 weeks). The placebo population (N = 316) had a mean age of 48 (range 21 to 81) years; was 87% female; 81% Caucasian, 10% African American, 7% Hispanic, 1% Asian, and 12% elderly (\u226565 years of age). Of those patients treated with lubiprostone 24 mcg twice daily (N=1113), the mean age was 50 (range 19-86) years; 87% were female; 86% Caucasian, 8% African American, 5% Hispanic, 1% Asian, and 17% elderly (\u226565 years of age). The most common adverse reactions (>4%) in CIC were nausea, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and flatulence. Table 2 presents data for the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients and that occurred more frequently with Lubiprostone than placebo. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 1% of patients treated with Lubiprostone and greater than placebo in Clinical Trials of Adults with CIC System/Adverse Reaction Placebo Lubiprostone 24 mcg Twice Daily N = 316 % N = 1113 % Nausea 3 29 Diarrhea 1 12 Headache 5 11 Abdominal pain 3 8 Abdominal distension 2 6 Flatulence 2 6 Vomiting 0 3 Loose stools 0 3 Edema <1 3 Abdominal discomfort This term combines \"abdominal tenderness,\" \"abdominal rigidity,\" \"gastrointestinal discomfort,\" \"stomach discomfort\", and \"abdominal discomfort.\" 1 3 Dizziness 1 3 Chest discomfort/pain 0 2 Dyspnea 0 2 Dyspepsia <1 2 Fatigue 1 2 Dry mouth <1 1 Nausea: Approximately 29% of patients who received lubiprostone experienced nausea; 4% of patients had severe nausea and 9% of patients discontinued treatment due to nausea. The rate of nausea was lower among male (8%) and elderly (19%) patients. No patients in the clinical studies were hospitalized due to nausea. Diarrhea: Approximately 12% of patients who received lubiprostone experienced diarrhea; 2% of patients had severe diarrhea and 2% of patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhea. Electrolytes: No serious adverse reactions of electrolyte imbalance were reported in clinical studies, and no clinically significant changes were seen in serum electrolyte levels in patients receiving lubiprostone. Less common adverse reactions (<1%): fecal incontinence, muscle cramp, defecation urgency, frequent bowel movements, hyperhidrosis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, intestinal functional disorder, anxiety, cold sweat, constipation, cough, dysgeusia, eructation, influenza, joint swelling, myalgia, pain, syncope, tremor, decreased appetite. Opioid-Induced Constipation Adverse reactions in adult efficacy and long-term clinical studies: The data described below reflect exposure to lubiprostone 24 mcg twice daily in 860 patients with OIC for up to 12 months and from 632 patients receiving placebo twice daily for up to 12 weeks. The total population (N = 1492) had a mean age of 50 (range 20\u201389) years; was 63% female; 83% Caucasian, 14% African American, 1% American Indian/Alaska Native, 1% Asian; 5% were of Hispanic ethnicity, and 9% were elderly (\u226565 years of age). The most common adverse reactions (>4%) in OIC were nausea and diarrhea. Table 3 presents data for the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients and that occurred more frequently with study drug than placebo. Table 3. Adverse Reactions Reported in at least 1% of patients treated with Lubiprostone and greater than placebo in Clinical Trials of Adults with OIC System/Adverse Reaction Placebo Lubiprostone 24 mcg Twice Daily N = 632 % N = 860 % Nausea 5 11 Diarrhea 2 8 Abdominal pain 1 4 Flatulence 3 4 Abdominal distension 2 3 Vomiting 2 3 Headache 1 2 Peripheral edema <1 1 Abdominal discomfort This term combines \"abdominal tenderness,\" \"abdominal rigidity,\" \"gastrointestinal discomfort,\" \"stomach discomfort\", and \"abdominal discomfort.\" 1 1 Nausea: Approximately 11% of patients who received lubiprostone experienced nausea; 1% of patients had severe nausea and 2% of patients discontinued treatment due to nausea. Diarrhea: Approximately 8% of patients who received lubiprostone experienced diarrhea; 2% of patients had severe diarrhea and 1% of patients discontinued treatment due to diarrhea. Less common adverse reactions (<1%): fecal incontinence, blood potassium decreased. Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation Adverse reactions in adult dose-finding, efficacy, and long-term clinical studies: The data described below reflect exposure to lubiprostone 8 mcg twice daily in 1011 patients with IBS-C for up to 12 months and from 435 patients receiving placebo twice daily for up to 16 weeks. The total population (N = 1267) had a mean age of 47 (range 18\u201385) years; was 92% female; 78% Caucasian, 13% African American, 9% Hispanic, 0.4% Asian, and 8% elderly (\u226565 years of age). The most common adverse reactions (>4%) in IBS-C were nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Table 4 presents data for the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of patients and that occurred more frequently with study drug than placebo. Table 4.
