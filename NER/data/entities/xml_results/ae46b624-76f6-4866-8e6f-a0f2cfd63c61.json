    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Intravenous administration of Sterile Water for Injection without a solute may result in hemolysis.PRECAUTIONS Do not use for intravenous injection unless the osmolar concentration of additives results in an approximate isotonic admixture. Consult the manufacturer's instructions for choice of vehicle, appropriate dilution or volume for dissolving the drugs to be injected, including the route and rate of injection. Inspect reconstituted (diluted or dissolved) drugs for clarity (if soluble) and freedom from unexpected precipitation or discoloration prior to administration. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sterile Water for Injection. It is also not known whether sterile water containing additives can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sterile Water for Injection with additives should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Pregnancy: Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients. However, in neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance. Drug Interactions Some drugs for injection may be incompatible in a given vehicle, or when combined in the same vehicle or in a vehicle containing benzyl alcohol. Consult with pharmacist, if available. Use aseptic technique for single or multiple entry and withdrawal from all containers. When diluting or dissolving drugs, mix thoroughly and use promptly. Do not store reconstituted solutions of drugs for injection unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer of the solute. Do not use unless the solution is clear and seal intact. Do not reuse single-dose containers. Discard unused portion.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of this solution, added drugs or the technique of reconstitution or administration include febrile response, local tenderness, abscess, tissue necrosis or infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection and extravasation. If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate countermeasures, and if possible, retrieve and save the remainder of the unused vehicle for examination.",
