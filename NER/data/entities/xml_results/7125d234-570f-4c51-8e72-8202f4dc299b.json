    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Effects : Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat tablets and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions : Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.2 )] Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage ( . 1 )] Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 )] 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.3 )] Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information ( . Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients. 17 )]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the prescribing information: \u2022 Cardiovascular Death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Hepatic Effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Adverse reactions in \u2265 1% of patients treated with febuxostat are liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Solco Healthcare US, LLC at 1-866-257-2597 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2,757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1,377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3,098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2,155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1,539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.2 )] Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were 6 to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22651% of Patients Treated with Febuxostat and at Least 0.5% Greater than in Patients Receiving Placebo in Controlled Studies Adverse Reactions Placebo Febuxostat allopurinol* (N=134) 40 mg daily (N=757) 80 mg daily (N=1,279) (N=1,277) Liver Function Abnormalities 0.7% 6.6% 4.6% 4.2% Nausea 0.7% 1.1% 1.3% 0.8% Arthralgia 0% 1.1% 0.7% 0.7% Rash 0.7% 0.5% 1.6% 1.6% * Of the patients who received allopurinol, 10 received 100 mg, 145 received 200 mg, and 1,122 received 300 mg, based on level of renal impairment. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy was liver function abnormalities in 1.8% of febuxostat 40 mg, 1.2% of febuxostat 80 mg, and in 0.9% of patients treated with allopurinol. In addition to the adverse reactions presented in Table 1, dizziness was reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo. In the CARES study, liver function abnormalities and diarrhea were reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat, although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than allopurinol. Less Common Adverse Reactions In clinical studies the following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients and in more than one subject treated with doses ranging from 40 mg to 240 mg of febuxostat.
