Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with other amphetamine products [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and also within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, because of an increased risk of hypertensive crisis [see .

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease: Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Monitor blood pressure and pulse. ( 5.3 ) Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: Prior to initiating MYDAYIS, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. If new psychotic or manic symptoms occur, consider discontinuing MYDAYIS. ( 5.4 ) Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients: Closely monitor growth (height and weight) in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. ( 5.5 ) Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon: Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during MYDAYIS treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. ( 5.6 ) Seizures: May lower the convulsive threshold. If a seizure occurs, discontinue MYDAYIS. ( 5.7 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when coadministered with serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans), but also during overdosage situations. If it occurs, discontinue MYDAYIS and initiate supportive treatment. ( 5.8 ) Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome: Before initiating MYDAYIS, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Regularly monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction MYDAYIS has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of MYDAYIS exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. MYDAYIS can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see . Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, can result in overdose and death Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ] [see , and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. Overdosage (10) ] Before prescribing MYDAYIS, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store MYDAYIS in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give MYDAYIS to anyone else. Throughout MYDAYIS treatment, reassess each patient\u2019s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. 5.2 Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid MYDAYIS use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. 5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3 to 6 bpm). Some patients may have larger increases. Monitor all MYDAYIS-treated patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating MYDAYIS treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression). New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing MYDAYIS. 5.5 Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. In a 4 week, placebo-controlled trial of MYDAYIS in patients ages 6 to 17 years old with ADHD, there was a decrease in weight in the MYDAYIS groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in MYDAYIS-treated pediatric patients. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. MYDAYIS is not approved for use in pediatric patients 12 years and younger [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon CNS stimulants, including MYDAYIS, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports and at the therapeutic dosage of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or discontinuation of the CNS stimulant. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during MYDAYIS treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for MYDAYIS-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. 5.7\tSeizures MYDAYIS may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizure, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, MYDAYIS should be discontinued. 5.8\tSerotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort [see . The coadministration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to MYDAYIS. In these situations, consider an alternative nonserotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 Drug Interactions (7.1) ] [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Concomitant use of MYDAYIS with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see . Contraindications (4) ] Discontinue treatment with MYDAYIS and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of MYDAYIS with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate MYDAYIS with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome. 5.9\tPotential for Overdose Due to Medication Errors Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between MYDAYIS and other amphetamine products could occur, leading to possible overdosage. To avoid substitution errors and overdosage, do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see . Dosage and Administration (2.7) , Overdosage (10) ] 5.10 Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome CNS stimulants, including amphetamine, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette\u2019s syndrome has also been reported [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Before initiating MYDAYIS, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Regularly monitor MYDAYIS-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2 , 9.3) ] Hypersensitivity to amphetamine products or other ingredients of MYDAYIS [see Contraindications (4) ] Hypertensive Crisis When Used Concomitantly with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Psychiatric Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud's Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette's Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Most common adverse reactions in patients with ADHD (incidence \u22655% and at a rate at least twice placebo) are: Pediatrics (13 years and older): insomnia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, irritability, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) Adults: insomnia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, dry mouth, increased heart rate, and anxiety.

MYDAYIS was studied in adults (18 to 55 years) and pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th or 5 th editions (DSM-IV-TR \u00ae or DSM-5) criteria for ADHD. The safety data for adults were pooled from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg per day (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). Doses higher than 50 mg per day did not demonstrate additional clinical benefit and are not recommended. The safety data for pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) is from 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of doses of 12.5 mg to 25 mg. The total exposure in patients treated with MYDAYIS totalled 704; this included pediatric patients, 78 adolescent patients and 626 adult patients from multiple well-controlled trials. The duration of use ranged from 4 to 7 weeks [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment In pooled controlled trials of adult patients, 9% (54/626) of MYDAYIS-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% (7/328) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MYDAYIS-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (2%, n=15), blood pressure increased (2%, n=10), decreased appetite (1%, n=5), and headache (1%, n=4). In a controlled trial including adolescent patients (13 to 17 years), 5% (4/78) of MYDAYIS-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 0% (0/79) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of MYDAYIS-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were dizziness (1%, n=1), depression (1%, n=1), abdominal pain upper (1%, n=1), and viral infection (1%, n=1). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of \u22652% and at Least Twice Placebo Among MYDAYIS-Treated Adults in Clinical Trials The most common adverse reactions reported in adults were insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, decreased weight, heart rate increased, and anxiety. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred \u22652% compared to placebo. The most common adverse reaction (insomnia) generally occurred early during treatment with MYDAYIS.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of amphetamines. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergic: Urticaria, rash, hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis. Serious skin rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. Cardiovascular: Dyspnea, sudden death. There have been isolated reports of cardiomyopathy associated with chronic amphetamine use. Central Nervous System: Psychotic episodes at recommended doses, overstimulation, restlessness, euphoria, dyskinesia, dysphoria, headache, tics, fatigue, aggression, anger, logorrhea, dermatillomania, and paresthesia (including formication), motor and verbal tics. Endocrine: Impotence, changes in libido, frequent or prolonged erections. Eye Disorders: Mydriasis. Gastrointestinal: Unpleasant taste, constipation, intestinal ischemia. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia. Vascular Disorders: Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.",
