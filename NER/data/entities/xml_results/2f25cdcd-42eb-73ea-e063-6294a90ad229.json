    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ELIQUIS is a factor Xa inhibitor indicated: to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. (1.1) for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. (1.2) for the treatment of DVT and PE, and for the reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy. (1.3 , 1.4 , 1.5) 1.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation ELIQUIS is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. 1.2 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery ELIQUIS is indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. 1.3 Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis ELIQUIS is indicated for the treatment of DVT. 1.4 Treatment of Pulmonary Embolism ELIQUIS is indicated for the treatment of PE. 1.5 Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE ELIQUIS is indicated to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ELIQUIS is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: Active pathological bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Severe hypersensitivity reaction to ELIQUIS (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Active pathological bleeding (4) Severe hypersensitivity to ELIQUIS (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ELIQUIS can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding. Promptly evaluate signs and symptoms of blood loss. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. (5.2) Prosthetic heart valves: ELIQUIS use not recommended. (5.4) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome: ELIQUIS use not recommended. (5.6) 5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and . Clinical Studies (14.1) ] 5.2 Bleeding ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see . Drug Interactions (7.3) ] Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. The pharmacodynamic effect of ELIQUIS can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose, i.e., for about two drug half-lives. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered, but have not been evaluated in clinical studies [see . When PCCs are used, monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of apixaban using a clotting test (PT, INR, or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not useful and is not recommended. Activated oral charcoal reduces absorption of apixaban, thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentration Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] [see Overdosage (10)] . Hemodialysis does not appear to have a substantial impact on apixaban exposure [see . Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of apixaban. There is no experience with antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) in individuals receiving apixaban. There is no experience with systemic hemostatics (desmopressin) in individuals receiving ELIQUIS, and they are not expected to be effective as a reversal agent. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.3 Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal/epidural puncture is employed, patients treated with antithrombotic agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of these events may be increased by the postoperative use of indwelling epidural catheters or the concomitant use of medicinal products affecting hemostasis. Indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheters should not be removed earlier than 24 hours after the last administration of ELIQUIS. The next dose of ELIQUIS should not be administered earlier than 5 hours after the removal of the catheter. The risk may also be increased by traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of ELIQUIS for 48 hours. Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment (e.g., numbness or weakness of the legs, or bowel or bladder dysfunction). If neurological compromise is noted, urgent diagnosis and treatment is necessary. Prior to neuraxial intervention the physician should consider the potential benefit versus the risk in anticoagulated patients or in patients to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. 5.4 Patients with Prosthetic Heart Valves The safety and efficacy of ELIQUIS have not been studied in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Therefore, use of ELIQUIS is not recommended in these patients. 5.5 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy Initiation of ELIQUIS is not recommended as an alternative to unfractionated heparin for the initial treatment of patients with PE who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. 5.6 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including ELIQUIS, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information. Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events After Premature Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>1%) are related to bleeding.

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation The safety of ELIQUIS was evaluated in the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES studies [see , including 11,284 patients exposed to ELIQUIS 5 mg twice daily and 602 patients exposed to ELIQUIS 2.5 mg twice daily. The duration of ELIQUIS exposure was \u226512 months for 9375 patients and \u226524 months for 3369 patients in the two studies. In ARISTOTLE, the mean duration of exposure was 89 weeks (>15,000 patient-years). In AVERROES, the mean duration of exposure was approximately 59 weeks (>3000 patient-years). Clinical Studies (14) ] The most common reason for treatment discontinuation in both studies was for bleeding-related adverse reactions; in ARISTOTLE this occurred in 1.7% and 2.5% of patients treated with ELIQUIS and warfarin, respectively, and in AVERROES, in 1.5% and 1.3% on ELIQUIS and aspirin, respectively. Bleeding in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in ARISTOTLE and AVERROES Tables 1 and 2 show the number of patients experiencing major bleeding during the treatment period and the bleeding rate (percentage of subjects with at least one bleeding event per 100 patient-years) in ARISTOTLE and AVERROES.

Bleeding events were counted during treatment or within 2 days of stopping study treatment (on-treatment period). \u2020 Defined as clinically overt bleeding accompanied by one or more of the following: a decrease in hemoglobin of \u22652 g/dL, a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells, bleeding at a critical site: intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal or with fatal outcome. \u2021 Intracranial bleed includes intracerebral, intraventricular, subdural, and subarachnoid bleeding. Any type of hemorrhagic stroke was adjudicated and counted as an intracranial major bleed. \u00a7 On-treatment analysis based on the safety population, compared to ITT analysis presented in Section 14. \u00b6 GI bleed includes upper GI, lower GI, and rectal bleeding. **\u00a0\tFatal bleeding is an adjudicated death with the primary cause of death as intracranial bleeding or non-intracranial bleeding during the on-treatment period. In ARISTOTLE, the results for major bleeding were generally consistent across most major subgroups including age, weight, CHADS 2 score (a scale from 0 to 6 used to estimate risk of stroke, with higher scores predicting greater risk), prior warfarin use, geographic region, and aspirin use at randomization (Figure 1). Subjects treated with ELIQUIS with diabetes bled more (3% per year) than did subjects without diabetes (1.9% per year).

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery The safety of ELIQUIS has been evaluated in 1 Phase II and 3 Phase III studies including 5924 patients exposed to ELIQUIS 2.5 mg twice daily undergoing major orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs (elective hip replacement or elective knee replacement) treated for up to 38 days. In total, 11% of the patients treated with ELIQUIS 2.5 mg twice daily experienced adverse reactions. Bleeding results during the treatment period in the Phase III studies are shown in Table 3. Bleeding was assessed in each study beginning with the first dose of double-blind study drug.

Common adverse reactions (\u22651%) were gingival bleeding, epistaxis, contusion, hematuria, rectal hemorrhage, hematoma, menorrhagia, and hemoptysis. AMPLIFY Study The mean duration of exposure to ELIQUIS was 154 days and to enoxaparin/warfarin was 152 days in the AMPLIFY study. Adverse reactions related to bleeding occurred in 417 (15.6%) ELIQUIS-treated patients compared to 661 (24.6%) enoxaparin/warfarin-treated patients. The discontinuation rate due to bleeding events was 0.7% in the ELIQUIS-treated patients compared to 1.7% in enoxaparin/warfarin-treated patients in the AMPLIFY study. In the AMPLIFY study, ELIQUIS was statistically superior to enoxaparin/warfarin in the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding (relative risk 0.31, 95% CI [0.17, 0.55], P-value <0.0001).
