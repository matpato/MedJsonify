    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions ( 5.1 ) \u2218 Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, immune-mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction, solid organ transplant rejection, and immune-mediated pancreatitis. o Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. o Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity and type of reaction. \u2022 Infusion-Related Reactions: Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity of the reaction. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. (5.3) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions IMFINZI is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. The incidence and severity of immune-mediated adverse reactions were similar when IMFINZI was administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy, unless otherwise noted. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD 1/PD L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . In general, if IMFINZI requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. IMFINZI as a Single Agent In Patients Who Did Not Receive Recent Prior Radiation In patients who received IMFINZI on clinical studies in which radiation therapy was generally not administered immediately prior to initiation of IMFINZI, the incidence of immune-mediated pneumonitis was 2.4% (34/1414), including fatal (< 0.1%), and Grade 3-4 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 19 of the 34 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 5 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 19 patients (19/34) with pneumonitis who did not receive chemoradiation prior to initiation of IMFINZI. The frequency and severity of immune-mediated pneumonitis in patients who did not receive definitive chemoradiation prior to IMFINZI were similar whether IMFINZI was given as a single agent in patients with various cancers in a pooled data set or in patients with ES-SCLC or BTC when given in combination with chemotherapy. In Patients Who Received Recent Prior Radiation The incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC following definitive chemoradiation within 42 days prior to initiation of IMFINZI in PACIFIC was 18.3% (87/475) in patients receiving IMFINZI and 12.8% (30/234) in patients receiving placebo. Of the patients who received IMFINZI (475), 1.1% had a fatal adverse reaction and 2.7% had Grade 3 adverse reactions. Events resolved in 50 of the 87 (57%) patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 27 of the 87 (31%) patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 64 patients (64/87) with pneumonitis who had received chemoradiation prior to initiation of IMFINZI, while 2 patients required use of infliximab with high-dose steroids. The incidence of pneumonitis (including radiation pneumonitis) in patients with LS-SCLC following chemoradiation within 42 days prior to initiation of IMFINZI in ADRIATIC was 14% (37/262) in patients receiving IMFINZI and 6% (16/265) in patients receiving placebo. Of the patients who received IMFINZI (262), 0.4% had a fatal adverse reaction and 2.7% had Grade 3 adverse reactions.

IMFINZI with Tremelimumab-actl and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.5% (21/596) of patients receiving IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-actl and platinum-based chemotherapy, including fatal (0.5%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 11 of the 21 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 7 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated pneumonitis, while 1 patient (1/21) required other immunosuppressants. Immune-Mediated Colitis IMFINZI can cause immune-mediated colitis that is frequently associated with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. IMFINZI as a Single Agent Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 2% (37/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 4 (< 0.1%) and Grade 3 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 27 of the 37 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 8 patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in all patients with immune-mediated colitis, while 2 patients (2/37) required other immunosuppressants (e.g., infliximab, mycophenolate). IMFINZI with Tremelimumab-actl Immune-mediated colitis or diarrhea occurred in 6% (23/388) of patients receiving IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-actl, including Grade 3 (3.6%) adverse reactions. Events resolved in 22 of the 23 patients and resulted in permanent discontinuation in 5 patients. All patients received systemic corticosteroids, and 20 of the 23 patients received high-dose corticosteroid treatment (at least 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day).

Cardiac/vascular: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy. Nervous system: Uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment to include blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Ocular: Pancreatitis including increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis. Gastrointestinal: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis and associated sequelae including renal failure, arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: Hypoparathyroidism. Endocrine: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection. Other (hematologic/immune): 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions IMFINZI can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Interrupt, slow the rate of, or permanently discontinue IMFINZI based on the severity [see . For Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, consider using pre-medications with subsequent doses. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] IMFINZI as a Single Agent Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (42/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions. IMFINZI in Combination with Tremelimumab-actl Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.6% (10/388) of patients receiving IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-actl. IMFINZI with Tremelimumab-actl and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.9% (17/596) of patients receiving IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab-actl, including Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 2.2% (42/1889) of patients receiving IMFINZI, including Grade 3 (0.3%) adverse reactions. 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT after IMFINZI Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/L-1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/L-1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/L-1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal studies, IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of durvalumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in increased premature delivery, fetal loss and premature neonatal death. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI and for 3 months after the last dose of IMFINZI [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 )]",

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to IMFINZI as a single agent in a total of 1,889 patients enrolled in the PACIFIC study (a randomized, placebo-controlled study that enrolled 475 patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC), Study 1108 (an open-label, single-arm, multicohort study that enrolled 970 patients with advanced solid tumors), and an additional open-label, single-arm study (ATLANTIC Study) that enrolled 444 patients with advanced solid tumors, including NSCLC. In these studies, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Among the 1889 patients, 38% were exposed for 6 months or more and 18% were exposed for 12 months or more. The data also reflect exposure to IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks as a single agent in 262 patients from the ADRIATIC study (a randomized, double-blind study in patients with LS-SCLC) and to IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy in 265 patients from the CASPIAN study (a randomized, open-label study in patients with ES-SCLC) and in 338 patients from the TOPAZ 1 study (a randomized, double-blind study in patients with BTC). In the CASPIAN and TOPAZ 1 studies, IMFINZI was administered at a dose of 1,500 mg every 3 or 4 weeks. The data also reflect exposure to IMFINZI 1,120 mg in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel (every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles) followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg (every 4 weeks) as a single agent in 235 patients in DUO-E (a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in endometrial cancer). Among the 235 patients, 77% (181 patients) were exposed to IMFINZI for 6 months or more and 41% (96 patients) for 12 months or more. The data also reflect exposure to IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with tremelimumab-actl 300 mg in 388 patients in HIMALAYA. In the HIMALAYA study patients received IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with tremelimumab-actl as a single intravenous infusion of 300 mg, followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks. The pooled safety population (N = 596) described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with tremelimumab-actl 75 mg and histology-based platinum chemotherapy regimens in 330 patients in POSEIDON [see , and 266 patients with ES-SCLC in CASPIAN who received up to four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus IMFINZI 1,500 mg with tremelimumab-actl 75 mg every 3 weeks, followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks (an unapproved regimen for extensive stage small cell lung cancer). Among the 596 patients, 55% were exposed to IMFINZI for 6 months or more and 24% were exposed for 12 months or more. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] The data described in this section reflect exposure to IMFINZI in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC enrolled in the PACIFIC study, in patients with metastatic NSCLC enrolled in the POSEIDON study, in patients with LS-SCLC enrolled in the ADRIATIC study, in patients with ES-SCLC enrolled in the CASPIAN study, in patients with BTC enrolled in the TOPAZ-1 study, in patients with uHCC included in the HIMALAYA study, in patients with dMMR endometrial cancer enrolled in the DUO-E study, and in patients with resectable NSCLC enrolled in the AEGEAN study. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Resectable NSCLC \u2013 AEGEAN The safety of IMFINZI in combination with neoadjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by surgery, and continued adjuvant treatment with IMFINZI as a single agent after surgery, was investigated in AEGEAN, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study for patients with resectable NSCLC (Stage IIA to select Stage IIIB [AJCC, 8 th edition]); squamous or non-squamous) [see .

Unresectable Stage III NSCLC - PACIFIC The safety of IMFINZI in patients with Stage III NSCLC who completed concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy within 42 days prior to initiation of study drug was evaluated in the PACIFIC study, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 475 patients received IMFINZI 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks. The study excluded patients who had disease progression following chemoradiation, with active or prior autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study or with medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 23 to 90), 45% age 65 years or older, 70% male, 69% White, 27% Asian, 75% former smoker, 16% current smoker, and 51% had WHO performance status of 1. All patients received definitive radiotherapy as per protocol, of which 92% received a total radiation dose of 54 Gy to 66 Gy. The median duration of exposure to IMFINZI was 10 months (range: 0.2 to 12.6). IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 15% of patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to IMFINZI discontinuation were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis in 6% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients receiving IMFINZI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis (7%) and pneumonia (6%). Fatal pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis and fatal pneumonia occurred in < 2% of patients and were similar across arms. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u2265 20% of patients) were cough, fatigue, pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis, upper respiratory tract infections, dyspnea, and rash.
