    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Arsenic Trioxide Injection is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to arsenic. Hypersensitivity to arsenic. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Monitor hepatic function tests at least twice weekly during induction and at least once weekly during consolidation. Withhold Arsenic Trioxide Injection for certain elevations in AST, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin and resume at reduced dose upon resolution. ( 2.3 , 5.4 ) Carcinogenesis : Arsenic trioxide is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. ( 5.5 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Differentiation Syndrome Differentiation syndrome, which may be life-threatening or fatal, has been observed in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with Arsenic Trioxide Injection. In clinical trials, 16-23% of patients treated with Arsenic Trioxide Injection for APL developed differentiation syndrome. Signs and symptoms include unexplained fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, acute respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusion, weight gain, peripheral edema, hypotension, renal insufficiency, hepatopathy and multi-organ dysfunction. Differentiation syndrome has been observed with and without concomitant leukocytosis, and it has occurred as early as day 1 of induction to as late as the second month induction therapy. If differentiation syndrome is suspected, temporarily withhold Arsenic Trioxide Injection and immediately initiate dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously every 12 hours and hemodynamic monitoring until resolution of signs and symptoms for a minimum of 3 days [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 )] 5.2 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Patients treated with Arsenic Trioxide Injection can develop QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, and complete atrioventricular block. In the clinical trial of patients with relapsed or refractory APL treated with Arsenic Trioxide Injection monotherapy, 40% had at least one ECG tracing with a QTc interval greater than 500 msec. A prolonged QTc was observed between 1 and 5 weeks after start of Arsenic Trioxide Injection infusion, and it usually resolved by 8 weeks after Arsenic Trioxide Injection infusion. There are no data on the effect of Arsenic Trioxide Injection on the QTc interval during the infusion of the drug. The risk of torsade de pointes is related to the extent of QTc prolongation, concomitant administration of QTc prolonging drugs, a history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QTc interval prolongation, congestive heart failure, administration of potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions that result in hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. The risk may be increased when Arsenic Trioxide Injection is coadministered with medications that can lead to electrolyte abnormalities (such as diuretics or amphotericin B) [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] Prior to initiating therapy with Arsenic Trioxide Injection, assess the QTc interval by electrocardiogram, correct preexisting electrolyte abnormalities, and consider discontinuing drugs known to prolong QTc interval. Do not administer Arsenic Trioxide Injection to patients with a ventricular arrhythmia or prolonged QTc. If possible, discontinue drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval. If it is not possible to discontinue the interacting drug, perform cardiac monitoring frequently [see Drug Interactions ( . During Arsenic Trioxide Injection therapy, maintain potassium concentrations above 4 mEq/L and magnesium concentrations above 1.8 mg/dL. Monitor ECG weekly and more frequently for clinically unstable patients. 7 )] For patients who develop a QTc Framingham greater than 450 msec for men or greater than 460 msec for women, withhold Arsenic Trioxide Injection and any medication known to prolong the QTc interval. Correct electrolyte abnormalities. When the QTc normalizes and electrolyte abnormalities are corrected, resume Arsenic Trioxide Injection at a reduced dose [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 )] 5.3 Encephalopathy Serious encephalopathies were reported in patients receiving Arsenic Trioxide Injection. Monitor patients for neurological symptoms, such as confusion, decreased level of consciousness, seizures, cognitive deficits, ataxia, visual symptoms and ocular motor dysfunction. Advise patients and caregivers of the need for close observation. Wernicke's Encephalopathy Wernicke's encephalopathy occurred in patients receiving Arsenic Trioxide Injection. Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurologic emergency that can be prevented and treated with thiamine. Consider testing thiamine levels in patients at risk for thiamine deficiency (e.g., chronic alcohol use, malabsorption, nutritional deficiency, concomitant use of furosemide). Administer parenteral thiamine in patients with or at risk for thiamine deficiency. Monitor patients for neurological symptoms and nutritional status while receiving Arsenic Trioxide Injection. If Wernicke's encephalopathy is suspected, immediately interrupt Arsenic Trioxide Injection and initiate parenteral thiamine. Monitor until symptoms resolve or improve and thiamine levels normalize. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity During treatment with Arsenic Trioxide Injection, monitor hepatic function tests at least twice weekly during induction and at least once weekly during consolidation. Withhold Arsenic Trioxide Injection if elevations in AST or alkaline phosphatase occur to greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal and/or elevation in serum total bilirubin occurs to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal and resume at reduced dose upon resolution [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 )] 5.5 Carcinogenesis The active ingredient of Arsenic Trioxide Injection, arsenic trioxide, is a human carcinogen. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Arsenic Trioxide Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Arsenic trioxide was embryolethal and teratogenic in rats when administered on gestation day 9 at a dose approximately 10 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. A related trivalent arsenic, sodium arsenite, produced teratogenicity when administered during gestation in mice at a dose approximately 5 times the projected human dose on a mg/m\u00b2 basis and in hamsters at an intravenous dose approximately equivalent to the projected human daily dose on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Arsenic Trioxide Injection and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Arsenic Trioxide Injection and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.3 )]",

Relapsed or Refractory APL Safety information was available for 52 patients with relapsed or refractory APL who participated in clinical trials of Arsenic Trioxide Injection. Forty patients in the Study PLRXAS01 received the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg, of whom 28 completed both induction and consolidation cycles. An additional 12 patients with relapsed or refractory APL received doses generally similar to the recommended dose. Serious adverse reactions observed in the 40 patients with refractory or relapsed APL enrolled in Study PLRXAS01 included differentiation syndrome (n=3), hyperleukocytosis (n=3), QTc interval \u2265 500 msec (n=16, 1 with torsade de pointes), atrial dysrhythmias (n=2), and hyperglycemia (n=2). The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were nausea, cough, fatigue, pyrexia, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, tachycardia, diarrhea, dyspnea, hypokalemia, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, insomnia, dermatitis, edema, QTc prolongation, rigors, sore throat, arthralgia, paresthesia, and pruritus.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
