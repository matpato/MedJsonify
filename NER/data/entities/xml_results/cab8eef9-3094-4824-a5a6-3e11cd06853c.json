    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute renal failure: Acute renal failure may occur in elderly patients ( with or without reduced renal function ) , patients who receive concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, or inadequately hydrated patients. Use with caution in elderly patients or those taking nephrotoxic drugs, reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment, and monitor renal function. ( 2.5 , 5.2 , 8.5 , 8.6 ) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and bone marrow failure including aplastic anemia have been reported in patients treated with valganciclovir tablets or ganciclovir. Valganciclovir tablets should be avoided if the absolute neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/\u00b5L, the platelet count is less than 25.000/\u00b5L, or the hemoglobin is less than 8 g/dL. Valganciclovir tablets should also be used with caution in patients with pre-existing cytopenias and in patients receiving myelosuppressive drugs or irradiation. Cytopenia may occur at any time during treatment and may worsen with continued dosing. Cell counts usually begin to recover within 3 to 7 days after discontinuing drug. In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, treatment with hematopoietic growth factors may be considered. Due to the frequency of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving valganciclovir tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts should be performed frequently, especially in infants, in patients with renal impairment, and in patients in whom ganciclovir or other nucleoside analogues have previously resulted in leukopenia, or in whom neutrophil counts are less than 1000 cells/\u03bcL at the beginning of treatment. Increased monitoring for cytopenias may be warranted if therapy with oral ganciclovir is changed to valganciclovir tablets, because of increased plasma concentrations of ganciclovir after valganciclovir tablets administration 6.1 ) ] , [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . 5.2 Acute Renal Failure Acute renal failure may occur in: \u2022 Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering valganciclovir tablets to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 ) ] . \u2022 Patients receiving potential nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering valganciclovir tablets to patients receiving potential nephrotoxic drugs. \u2022 Patients without adequate hydration. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients. 5.3 Impairment of Fertility Based on animal data and limited human data, valganciclovir tablets at the recommended human doses may cause temporary or permanent inhibition of spermatogenesis in males, and may cause suppression of fertility in females. Advise patients that fertility may be impaired with use of valganciclovir tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ] . 5.4 Fetal Toxicity Ganciclovir may cause fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant women based on findings in animal studies. When given to pregnant rabbits at dosages resulting in 2 times the human exposure ( based on AUC ) , ganciclovir caused malformations in multiple organs of the fetuses. Maternal and fetal toxicity were also observed in pregnant mice and rabbits. Therefore, valganciclovir tablets have the potential to cause birth defects. Pregnancy should be avoided in female patients taking valganciclovir tablets and in females with male partners taking valganciclovir tablets. Females of reproductive potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days following treatment with valganciclovir tablets because of the potential risk to the fetus. Similarly, males should be advised to use condoms during and for at least 90 days following treatment with valganciclovir tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1, 8.3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ] . 5.5 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis Animal data indicate that ganciclovir is mutagenic and carcinogenic. Valganciclovir tablets should therefore be considered a potential carcinogen in humans [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) ] .",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . \u2022 Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . \u2022 Impairment of Fertility [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] . \u2022 Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] . \u2022 Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] . The most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in at least one indication by greater than or equal to 20% of adult patients treated with valganciclovir tablets are diarrhea, pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, tremor, neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, headache, insomnia, urinary tract infection, and vomiting. The most common reported adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in greater than or equal to 20% of pediatric solid organ transplant recipients treated with valganciclovir tablets are diarrhea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, and headache. \u2022 Adult patients: Most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities ( reported in at least one indication by greater than or equal to 20% of patients ) are diarrhea, pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, tremor, neutropenia, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, headache, insomnia, urinary tract infection, and vomiting. ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Pediatric patients: Most common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities ( reported in greater than or equal to 20% of pediatric solid organ transplant recipients ) are diarrhea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 orwww.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Valganciclovir, a prodrug of ganciclovir, is rapidly converted to ganciclovir after oral administration. Adverse reactions known to be associated with ganciclovir usage can therefore be expected to occur with valganciclovir tablets. Adverse Reactions in Adults: Treatment of CMV Retinitis in AIDS Patients: In a clinical study for the treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected patients, the adverse reactions reported by patients receiving valganciclovir tablets ( n=79 ) or intravenous ganciclovir ( n=79 ) for 28 days of randomized therapy ( 21 days induction dose and 7 days maintenance dose ) , respectively, included diarrhea ( 16% , 10% ) , nausea ( 8% , 14% ) , and headache ( 9% , 5% ) . The incidence of adverse reactions was similar between the group who received valganciclovir tablets and the group who received intravenous ganciclovir. The frequencies of neutropenia ( ANC less than 500/\u03bcL ) were 11% for patients receiving valganciclovir tablets compared with 13% for patients receiving intravenous ganciclovir. Anemia ( Hgb less than 8 g/dL ) occurred in 8% of patients in each group. Other laboratory abnormalities occurred with similar frequencies in the two groups. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities are available for 370 patients who received maintenance therapy with valganciclovir tablets 900 mg once daily in two open-label clinical trials. Approximately 252 ( 68% ) of these patients received valganciclovir tablets for more than nine months ( maximum duration was 36 months ) . Table 3 and Table 4 show pooled selected adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory values from these patients.

Other adverse drug reactions from valganciclovir in clinical trials in CMV retinitis and solid organ transplant patients Other adverse drug reactions with valganciclovir in clinical trials in either patients with CMV retinitis or solid organ transplant patients that occurred in at least 5% of patients are listed below. Eye disorders: retinal detachment, eye pain Gastrointestinal disorders: dyspepsia, constipation, abdominal distention, mouth ulceration General disorders and administration site conditions: fatigue, pain, malaise, asthenia, chills, peripheral edema Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic function abnormal Infections and infestations: candida infections including oral candidiasis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, urinary tract infection, pharyngitis/nasopharyngitis, postoperative wound infection Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: postoperative complications, wound secretion Metabolic and nutrition disorders: decreased appetite, hyperkalemia, hypophosphatemia, weight decreased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: back pain, myalgia, arthralgia, muscle spasms Nervous system disorders: insomnia, neuropathy peripheral, dizziness Psychiatric disorders: depression, anxiety Renal and urinary disorders: renal impairment, creatinine clearance renal decreased, blood creatinine increased, hematuria Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: cough, dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissues disorders: dermatitis, night sweats, pruritus Vascular disorders: hypotension Other adverse reactions with valganciclovir in clinical trials in either patients with CMV retinitis or solid organ transplant patients that occurred in less than 5% of patients are listed below. Blood and lymphatic disorders: febrile neutropenia, pancytopenia, bone marrow failure ( including aplastic anemia ) Cardiovascular disorders: arrhythmia Ear and labyrinth disorders: deafness Eye disorders: macular edema Gastrointestinal disorders: pancreatitis Hemorrhage: potentially life-threatening bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity Infections and infestations: cellulitis, sepsis Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: postoperative pain, wound dehiscence Investigations: aspartate aminotransferase increased, alanine aminotransferase increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: limb pain Nervous system disorders: seizure, dysguesia ( taste disturbance ) Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, agitation, psychotic disorder, hallucinations Renal and urinary disorders: renal failure Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients: Valganciclovir tablets have been studied in 179 pediatric solid organ transplant patients who were at risk for developing CMV disease ( aged 3 weeks to 16 years ) and in 24 neonates with symptomatic congenital CMV disease ( aged 8 to 34 days ) , with duration of ganciclovir exposure ranging from 2 to 200 days [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] . Prevention of CMV Disease in Pediatric Solid Organ Transplant Patients: The most frequently reported adverse reactions ( greater than 10% of patients ) , regardless of seriousness, in pediatric solid organ transplant patients taking valganciclovir until Day 100 post-transplant were diarrhea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting, anemia, neutropenia, constipation and nausea. The most frequently reported adverse reactions ( greater than 10% of patients ) in pediatric kidney transplant patients treated with valganciclovir until Day 200 post-transplant were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, leukopenia, neutropenia, headache, abdominal pain, tremor, pyrexia, anemia, blood creatinine increased, vomiting, and hematuria. In general, the safety profile was similar in pediatric patients compared to that observed in adult patients. However, the rates of certain adverse reactions, and laboratory abnormalities, such as upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, anemia, and abdominal pain were reported more frequently in pediatric patients than in adults [see Use in Specific Populations ( Neutropenia was reported at a higher incidence in the two pediatric studies as compared to adults, but there was no correlation between neutropenia and infections observed in the pediatric population. 8.4 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] . The overall safety profile of valganciclovir was similar with the extension of prophylaxis until Day 200 post-transplant in high risk pediatric kidney transplant patients. However, the incidence of severe neutropenia ( ANC < 500/\u03bcL ) was higher in pediatric kidney transplant patients treated with valganciclovir until Day 200 ( 17/57, 30% ) compared to pediatric kidney transplant patients treated until Day 100 ( 3/63, 5% ) . There were no differences in the incidence of severe ( Grade 4 ) anemia or thrombocytopenia in patients treated 100 or 200 days with valganciclovir. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of valganciclovir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. As valganciclovir are rapidly and extensively converted to ganciclovir, any adverse reactions associated with ganciclovir might also occur with valganciclovir. \u2013 Anaphylactic reaction \u2013 Agranulocytosis \u2013 Granulocytopenia In general, the adverse reactions reported during the postmarketing use of valganciclovir were similar to those identified during the clinical trials.",
