    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. (5.1) Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes manifesting as bradycardia or heart block. (5.2) Monitor patients for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers. (5.3) Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release can cause diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. (5.4) Memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release may cause bladder outflow obstructions. (5.5) Conditions that raise urine pH may decrease the urinary elimination of memantine, resulting in increased plasma levels of memantine. (5.5 , 7.1) 5.1       Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2       Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules. 5.3       Peptic Ulcer Disease and Gastrointestinal Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients treated with memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 5.4       Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride, when initiated, as a predictable consequence of its pharmacological properties, has been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Although in most cases, these effects have been mild and transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment. 5.5       Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. Conditions that raise urine pH may decrease the urinary elimination of memantine, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, resulting in increased plasma levels of memantine [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] 5.6       Seizures Cholinomimetics, including donepezil hydrochloride, an active ingredient in memantine and donepezil hydrochlorides extended-release capsules, are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. 5.7       Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling. Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Peptic Ulcer Disease and Gastrointestinal Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] The most common adverse reactions, occurring at a frequency of at least 5% and greater than placebo with memantine hydrochloride extended-release 28 mg/day, were headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. (6.1) The most common adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil and at twice or more the placebo rate, include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1       Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Memantine Hydrochloride Memantine hydrochloride extended-release was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 676 patients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer\u2019s type (341 patients treated with memantine 28 mg/day dose and 335 patients treated with placebo) for a treatment period up to 24 weeks. Of the patients randomized, 236 treated with memantine 28 mg/day and 227 treated with placebo were on a stable dose of donepezil for 3 months prior to screening. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation with Memantine Hydrochloride In the placebo-controlled clinical trial of memantine hydrochloride extended-release, the proportion of patients in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release 28 mg/day dose group and in the placebo group who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 10% and 6%, respectively. The most common adverse reaction in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release treated group that led to treatment discontinuation was dizziness, at a rate of 1.5%. Most Common Adverse Reactions with Memantine Hydrochloride The most common adverse reactions with memantine hydrochloride extended-release in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release group and at a higher frequency than placebo, were headache, diarrhea, and dizziness. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of \u2265 2% in the memantine hydrochloride extended-release treated group and occurred at a rate greater than placebo.

The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride patients and at twice or more the incidence seen with placebo, were anorexia (2%), nausea (2%), diarrhea (2%) and urinary tract infection (2%). Most Common Adverse Reactions with Donepezil Hydrochloride The most common adverse reactions reported with donepezil hydrochloride in controlled clinical trials in patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in the donepezil hydrochloride group and at twice or more the placebo rate, were diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. The most common adverse reactions reported with donepezil hydrochloride in controlled clinical trials in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease were insomnia, muscle cramp, and fatigue. Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of \u2265 2% in the donepezil hydrochloride group and at a rate greater than placebo in controlled trials in patients with severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.
