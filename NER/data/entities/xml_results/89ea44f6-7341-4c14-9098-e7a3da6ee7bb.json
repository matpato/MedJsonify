PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions and drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. There are certain other drugs for which concomitant use with PAXLOVID should be avoided and/or dose adjustment, interruption, or therapeutic monitoring is recommended. Drugs listed in this section are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 The concomitant use of PAXLOVID and certain other drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions. Consult the Full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. ( 5.1 , 7 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 HIV-1 Drug Resistance: PAXLOVID use may lead to a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection. ( 5.4 ) 5.1\tRisk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of PAXLOVID, which contains ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Medications that induce CYP3A may decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID. These interactions may lead to: \u2022 Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications. \u2022 Loss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistance. Severe, life-threatening, and/or fatal adverse reactions due to drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with PAXLOVID. The most commonly reported concomitant medications resulting in serious adverse reactions were calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine), followed by calcium channel blockers. Prior to prescribing PAXLOVID, review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions and determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoring (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) [see . See Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. Consider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed [see . Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14) ] 5.2\tHypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID [see If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.3\tHepatotoxicity Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis. 5.4\tRisk of HIV-1 Resistance Development Because nirmatrelvir is co-administered with ritonavir, there may be a risk of HIV-1 developing resistance to HIV protease inhibitors in individuals with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection [see . Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22651% and greater incidence than in the placebo group) are dysgeusia and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of PAXLOVID is based on two Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in symptomatic adult subjects 18 years of age and older with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects in both studies received PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) or placebo every 12 hours for 5 days for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset [see : Clinical Studies (14) ] \u2022 Trial C4671005 (EPIC-HR) enrolled subjects who were at high risk for progression to severe disease. \u2022 Trial C4671002 (EPIC-SR) enrolled subjects who were at standard risk for progression to severe disease (previously unvaccinated subjects at standard risk or fully vaccinated subjects with at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease). Adverse reactions were those reported while subjects were on study medication and through 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. In Trial C4671005 (EPIC-HR), 1,038 subjects received PAXLOVID and 1,053 subjects received placebo. The most common adverse reactions (\u22651% incidence in the PAXLOVID group and occurring at a greater frequency than in the placebo group) were dysgeusia (5% and <1%, respectively) and diarrhea (3% and 2%, respectively). Among vaccinated or unvaccinated subjects at standard risk or fully vaccinated subjects with at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease in Trial C4671002 (EPIC-SR), 540 subjects received PAXLOVID and 528 subjects received placebo. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in EPIC-HR. Trial C4671028 (EPIC-SRI) was a Phase 1, open-label trial that evaluated the effects of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of PAXLOVID in non-hospitalized adult participants with COVID-19 and severe renal impairment. A total of 15 subjects with severe renal impairment were enrolled in this trial, with 12 subjects receiving intermittent hemodialysis and 3 subjects not on hemodialysis. Subjects received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg once on Day 1 followed by nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 150 mg/100 mg once daily from Days 2-5. The safety profile of PAXLOVID in subjects with severe renal impairment, including those requiring hemodialysis, was consistent with the safety profile observed in the Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials.
