    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk for Misinterpretation: Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake can be seen in a variety of tumor types and in non-malignant processes. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended. ( 5.1 ) Radiation Risks: Ensure safe handling to protect patients and health care providers from unintentional radiation exposure. ( 2.1 , 5.2 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions to Sulfites: Ascorbic Acid Stabilizer contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Risk for Misinterpretation Image interpretation errors can occur with GOZELLIX PET. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer as well as non-malignant processes such as Paget's disease, fibrous dysplasia, and osteophytosis. The performance of GOZELLIX for imaging of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels and by site of disease. The performance of GOZELLIX for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems to be affected by Gleason score [ see . Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2) ] Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer site, is recommended. 5.2 Radiation Risks Gallium Ga 68 gozetotide contributes to a patient's overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. Ensure safe handling to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and health care providers. Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration [see . Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.3) ] 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions to Sulfites Ascorbic Acid Stabilizer contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions include nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Telix Pharmaceuticals (US) Inc. at 1-844-455-8638 or contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of GOZELLIX has been established based on two prospective studies of another formulation of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide in patients with prostate cancer [see . Below is a display of the adverse reactions in these studies. Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2) ] The safety of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide was evaluated in 960 patients in the PSMA-PreRP and PSMA-BCR studies, each receiving one dose of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide. The average injected activity was 188.7 \u00b1 40.7 MBq (5.1 \u00b1 1.1 mCi) [see . The most commonly reported adverse reactions were nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness, occurring at a rate of <1%.
