    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS): Has occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and in allogenic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant patients receiving 8\u00a0grams per day of VALTREX in clinical trials. Discontinue treatment if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TTP/HUS occur. ( 5.1 ) Acute renal failure: May occur in elderly patients (with or without reduced renal function), patients with underlying renal disease who receive higher-than-recommended doses of VALTREX for their level of renal function, patients who receive concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, or inadequately hydrated patients. Use with caution in elderly patients and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Central nervous system adverse reactions (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, confusion, and encephalopathy): May occur in both adult and pediatric patients (with or without reduced renal function) and in patients with underlying renal disease who receive higher-than-recommended doses of VALTREX for their level of renal function. Elderly patients are more likely to have central nervous system adverse reactions. Use with caution in elderly patients and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.4 , 5.3 ) 5.1 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TTP/HUS) TTP/HUS, in some cases resulting in death, has occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and also in allogeneic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant recipients participating in clinical trials of VALTREX at doses of 8\u00a0grams per day. Treatment with VALTREX should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities consistent with TTP/HUS occur. 5.2 Acute Renal Failure Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in: Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering VALTREX to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of VALTREX for their level of renal function. Dosage reduction is recommended when administering VALTREX to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Patients receiving other nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering VALTREX to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs. Patients without adequate hydration. Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility (2.5\u00a0mg/mL) is exceeded in the intratubular fluid. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients. In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.3 )] 5.3 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system adverse reactions, including agitation, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, seizures, and encephalopathy, have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients with or without reduced renal function and in patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of VALTREX for their level of renal function. Elderly patients are more likely to have central nervous system adverse reactions. VALTREX should be discontinued if central nervous system adverse reactions occur [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 )].",

Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] Central Nervous System Effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] The most common adverse reactions reported in at least 1\u00a0indication by greater than 10% of adult subjects treated with VALTREX and observed more frequently with VALTREX compared with placebo are headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. The only adverse reaction reported in greater than 10% of pediatric subjects aged less than 18\u00a0years was headache. The most common adverse reactions reported in at least one indication by greater than 10% of adult subjects treated with VALTREX and more commonly than in subjects treated with placebo are headache, nausea, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) The only adverse reaction occurring in greater than 10% of pediatric subjects aged less than 18\u00a0years was headache.

Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis) In clinical trials for the treatment of cold sores, the adverse reactions reported by subjects receiving VALTREX 2\u00a0grams twice daily (n\u00a0=\u00a0609) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a0609) for 1\u00a0day, respectively, included headache (14%, 10%) and dizziness (2%, 1%). The frequencies of abnormal ALT (greater than 2 x ULN) were 1.8% for subjects receiving VALTREX compared with 0.8% for placebo. Other laboratory abnormalities (hemoglobin, white blood cells, alkaline phosphatase, and serum creatinine) occurred with similar frequencies in the 2\u00a0groups. Genital Herpes Initial Episode: In a clinical trial for the treatment of initial episodes of genital herpes, the adverse reactions reported by greater than or equal to 5% of subjects receiving VALTREX 1\u00a0gram twice daily for 10\u00a0days (n\u00a0=\u00a0318) or oral acyclovir 200\u00a0mg 5\u00a0times daily for 10\u00a0days (n\u00a0=\u00a0318), respectively, included headache (13%, 10%) and nausea (6%, 6%).

Post-randomization laboratory abnormalities that were reported more frequently in valacyclovir subjects versus placebo included elevated alkaline phosphatase (4%, 2%), elevated ALT (14%, 10%), elevated AST (16%, 11%), decreased neutrophil counts (18%, 10%), and decreased platelet counts (3%, 0%), respectively. Reduction of Transmission: In a clinical trial for the reduction of transmission of genital herpes, the adverse reactions reported by subjects receiving VALTREX 500\u00a0mg once daily (n\u00a0=\u00a0743) or placebo once daily (n\u00a0=\u00a0741), respectively, included headache (29%, 26%), nasopharyngitis (16%, 15%), and upper respiratory tract infection (9%, 10%).

Sixty-five of these pediatric subjects, aged 12 to less than 18\u00a0years, received oral tablets for 1 to 2\u00a0days for treatment of cold sores. The remaining 112\u00a0pediatric subjects, aged 1\u00a0month to less than 12\u00a0years, participated in 3 pharmacokinetic and safety trials and received valacyclovir oral suspension. Fifty-one of these 112\u00a0pediatric subjects received oral suspension for 3 to 6\u00a0days. The frequency, intensity, and nature of clinical adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were similar to those seen in adults. Pediatric Subjects Aged 12 to Less than 18\u00a0Years (Cold Sores) In clinical trials for the treatment of cold sores, the adverse reactions reported by adolescent subjects receiving VALTREX 2\u00a0grams twice daily for 1\u00a0day, or VALTREX 2\u00a0grams twice daily for 1\u00a0day followed by 1\u00a0gram twice daily for 1\u00a0day (n\u00a0=\u00a065, across both dosing groups), or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a030), respectively, included headache (17%, 3%) and nausea (8%, 0%). Pediatric Subjects Aged 1 Month to Less than 12\u00a0Years Adverse events reported in more than 1\u00a0subject across the 3\u00a0pharmacokinetic and safety trials in children aged 1\u00a0month to less than 12\u00a0years were diarrhea (5%), pyrexia (4%), dehydration (2%), herpes simplex (2%), and rhinorrhea (2%). No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values were observed. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of VALTREX. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to VALTREX.

Allergic Acute hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, dyspnea, pruritus, rash, and urticaria [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] Central Nervous System (CNS) Symptoms Aggressive behavior; agitation; ataxia; coma; confusion; decreased consciousness; dysarthria; encephalopathy; mania; and psychosis, including auditory and visual hallucinations, seizures, tremors [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 )] Eye Visual abnormalities.
