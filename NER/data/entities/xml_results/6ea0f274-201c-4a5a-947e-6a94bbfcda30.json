    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections. Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae ), Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. NOTE: For information on use in pediatric patients (see and PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Pediatric Use sections). CLINICAL STUDIES Intra-Abdominal Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. (including K. pneumoniae ), Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis ), and Enterobacter spp. Gynecological Infections caused by beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis ). While Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP due to its ampicillin content. Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and beta-lactamase producing organisms susceptible to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP should not require the addition of another antibacterial. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to Ampicillin and Sulbactam. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above in the indicated organ systems. Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted if appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam and other antibacterial drugs, Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP is contraindicated in individuals with a history of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to ampicillin, sulbactam or to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins). Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP is contraindicated in patients with a previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. These reactions are more apt to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or hypersensitivity reactions to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before therapy with a penicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, and other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should be discontinued and the appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity Hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice has been associated with the use of Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Hepatic toxicity is usually reversible; however, deaths have been reported. Hepatic function should be monitored at regular intervals in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP may cause severe skin reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), dermatitis exfoliative, erythema multiforme, and Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP discontinued if lesions progress (see and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections). ADVERSE REACTIONS Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Ampicillin and Sulbactam, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.PRECAUTIONS General A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop a skin rash. Thus, ampicillin class antibacterials should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. In patients treated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection the possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida ), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of ampicillin and sulbactam. Concurrent use of probenecid with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of ampicillin and sulbactam. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and allopurinol administered concurrently. Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP and aminoglycosides should not be reconstituted together due to the in vitro inactivation of aminoglycosides by the ampicillin component of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, USP. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of Ampicillin and Sulbactam will result in high urine concentration of ampicillin. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest \u2122 , Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix \u2122 or Testape \u2122 ) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in mice, rats, and rabbits at doses up to ten (10) times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Ampicillin and Sulbactam. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. (See \u2013 section.) PRECAUTIONS - Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Labor and Delivery Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers Low concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam have been established for pediatric patients one year of age and older for skin and skin structure infections as approved in adults. Use of Ampicillin and Sulbactam in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with additional data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies, a controlled clinical trial conducted in pediatric patients and post-marketing adverse events surveillance. (See and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , INDICATIONS AND USAGE , ADVERSE REACTIONS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, sections.) CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam have not been established for pediatric patients for intra-abdominal infections.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult Patients Ampicillin and Sulbactam is generally well tolerated. The following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials. Local Adverse Reactions Pain at IM injection site \u2013 16% Pain at IV injection site \u2013 3% Thrombophlebitis \u2013 3% Phlebitis \u2013 1.2% Systemic Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea in 3% of the patients and rash in less than 2% of the patients. Additional systemic reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients were: itching, nausea, vomiting, candidiasis, fatigue, malaise, headache, chest pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitis, urine retention, dysuria, edema, facial swelling, erythema, chills, tightness in throat, substernal pain, epistaxis and mucosal bleeding. Pediatric Patients Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with Ampicillin and Sulbactam demonstrate a similar adverse events profile to those observed in adult patients. Additionally, atypical lymphocytosis has been observed in one pediatric patient receiving Ampicillin and Sulbactam. Adverse Laboratory Changes Adverse laboratory changes without regard to drug relationship that were reported during clinical trials were: Hepatic : Increased AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, and LDH. Hematologic : Decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and increased lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and platelets. Blood Chemistry : Decreased serum albumin and total proteins. Renal : Increased BUN and creatinine. Urinalysis : Presence of RBC's and hyaline casts in urine. Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following have been identified during post-marketing use of Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection or other products containing ampicillin. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency, or potential causal connection to Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. Some individuals have developed positive direct Coombs Tests during treatment with Ampicillin and sulbactam for injection, as with other beta-lactam antibacterials. Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, abnormal hepatic function, melena, gastritis, stomatitis, dyspepsia, black \u201chairy\u201d tongue and Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea.
