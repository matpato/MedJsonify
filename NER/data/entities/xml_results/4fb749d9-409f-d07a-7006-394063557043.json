    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events: Postmarketing reports of serious or clinically significant neuropsychiatric adverse events have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide. Observe patients attempting to quit smoking with varenicline tablets for the occurrence of such symptoms and instruct them to discontinue varenicline tablets and contact a healthcare provider if they experience such adverse events. ( 5.1 ) Seizures : New or worsening seizures have been observed in patients taking varenicline tablets. Varenicline tablets should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other factors that can lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.2 ) Interaction with Alcohol: Increased effects of alcohol have been reported. Instruct patients to reduce the amount of alcohol they consume until they know whether varenicline tablets affects them. ( 5.3 ) Accidental injury: Accidental injuries (e.g., traffic accidents) have been reported. Instruct patients to use caution driving or operating machinery until they know how varenicline tablets may affect them. ( 5.4 ) Cardiovascular Events: Patients with underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease may be at increased risk of CV events; however, these concerns must be balanced with the health benefits of smoking cessation. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare providers of new or worsening CV symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. ( 5.5 and 6.1 ) Somnambulism: Cases of somnambulism have been reported in patients taking varenicline tablets. Some cases described harmful behavior to self, others, or property. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline tablets and notify their healthcare provider if they experience somnambulism. ( 5.6 and 6.2 ) Angioedema and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Such reactions, including angioedema, infrequently life-threatening, have been reported. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline tablets and immediately seek medical care if symptoms occur. ( 5.7 and 6.2 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Rare, potentially life-threatening skin reactions have been reported. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline tablets and contact a healthcare provider immediately at first appearance of skin rash with mucosal lesions. ( 5.8 and 6.2 ) Nausea: Nausea is the most common adverse reaction (up to 30% incidence rate). Dose reduction may be helpful. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events including Suicidality Serious neuropsychiatric adverse events have been reported in patients being treated with varenicline tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( These postmarketing reports have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide. Some patients who stopped smoking may have been experiencing symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, including depressed mood. Depression, rarely including suicidal ideation, has been reported in smokers undergoing a smoking cessation attempt without medication. However, some of these adverse events occurred in patients taking varenicline tablets who continued to smoke. 6.2 )]. Neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred in patients without and with pre-existing psychiatric disease; some patients experienced worsening of their psychiatric illnesses. Some neuropsychiatric adverse events, including unusual and sometimes aggressive behavior directed to oneself or others, may have been worsened by concomitant use of alcohol [see Warnings and Precautions ( Observe patients for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should stop taking varenicline tablets and contact a healthcare provider immediately if agitation, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient are observed, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. The healthcare provider should evaluate the severity of the symptoms and the extent to which the patient is benefiting from treatment, and consider options including dose reduction, continued treatment under closer monitoring, or discontinuing treatment. In many post marketing cases, resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of varenicline tablets was reported. However, the symptoms persisted in some cases; therefore, ongoing monitoring and supportive care should be provided until symptoms resolve. 5.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. The neuropsychiatric safety of varenicline tablets\u00a0was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled study that included patients without a history of psychiatric disorder (non-psychiatric cohort, N=3912) and patients with a history of psychiatric disorder (psychiatric cohort, N=4003). In the non-psychiatric cohort, varenicline tablets\u00a0were not associated with an increased incidence of clinically significant neuropsychiatric adverse events in a composite endpoint comprising anxiety, depression, feeling abnormal, hostility, agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, homicidal ideation, mania, panic, and irritability. In the psychiatric cohort, there were more events reported in each treatment group compared to the non-psychiatric cohort, and the incidence of events in the composite endpoint was higher for each of the active treatments compared to placebo: Risk Differences (RDs) (95%CI) vs. placebo were 2.7% (-0.05, 5.4) for varenicline tablets, 2.2% (-0.5, 4.9) for bupropion, and 0.4% (-2.2, 3.0) for transdermal nicotine. In the non-psychiatric cohort, neuropsychiatric adverse events of a serious nature were reported in 0.1% of varenicline-treated patients and 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. In the psychiatric cohort, neuropsychiatric events of a serious nature were reported in 0.6% of varenicline-treated patients, with 0.5% involving psychiatric hospitalization. In placebo-treated patients, serious neuropsychiatric events occurred in 0.6%, with 0.2% requiring psychiatric hospitalization [see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 )]. 5.2 Seizures During clinical trials and the postmarketing experience, there have been reports of seizures in patients treated with varenicline tablets. Some patients had no history of seizures, whereas others had a history of seizure disorder that was remote or well-controlled. In most cases, the seizure occurred within the first month of therapy. Weigh this potential risk against the potential benefits before prescribing varenicline tablets in patients with a history of seizures or other factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Advise patients to discontinue varenicline tablets and contact a healthcare provider immediately if they experience a seizure while on treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.3 Interaction with Alcohol There have been postmarketing reports of patients experiencing increased intoxicating effects of alcohol while taking varenicline tablets. Some cases described unusual and sometimes aggressive behavior and were often accompanied by amnesia for the events. Advise patients to reduce the amount of alcohol they consume while taking varenicline tablets until they know whether varenicline tablets affect their tolerance for alcohol [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.4 Accidental Injury There have been postmarketing reports of traffic accidents, near-miss incidents in traffic, or other accidental injuries in patients taking varenicline tablets. In some cases, the patients reported somnolence, dizziness, loss of consciousness or difficulty concentrating that resulted in impairment, or concern about potential impairment, in driving or operating machinery. Advise patients to use caution driving or operating machinery or engaging in other potentially hazardous activities until they know how varenicline tablets may affect them. 5.5 Cardiovascular Events A comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular (CV) risk with varenicline tablets suggests that patients with underlying CV disease may be at increased risk; however, these concerns must be balanced with the health benefits of smoking cessation. CV risk has been assessed for varenicline tablets in randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses of RCTs. In a smoking cessation trial in patients with stable CV disease, CV events were infrequent overall; however, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and nonfatal stroke occurred more frequently in patients treated with varenicline tablets compared to placebo. All-cause and CV mortality was lower in patients treated with varenicline tablets [see Clinical Studies ( This study was included in a meta-analysis of 15 varenicline tablets efficacy trials in various clinical populations that showed an increased hazard ratio for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) of 1.95; however, the finding was not statistically significant (95% CI: 0.79, 4.82). In the large postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome trial, an analysis of adjudicated MACE events was conducted for patients while in the trial and during a 28-week non-treatment extension period. Few MACE events occurred during the trial; therefore, the findings did not contribute substantively to the understanding of CV risk with varenicline tablets. Instruct patients to notify their healthcare providers of new or worsening CV symptoms and to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs and symptoms of MI or stroke 14.8 )]. [see Clinical Studies ( 14.10 )]. 5.6 Somnambulism Cases of somnambulism have been reported in patients taking varenicline tablets. Some cases described harmful behavior to self, others, or property. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline tablets and notify their healthcare provider if they experience somnambulism [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 5.7 Angioedema and Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema in patients treated with varenicline tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), extremities, and neck (throat and larynx). There were infrequent reports of life-threatening angioedema requiring emergent medical attention due to respiratory compromise. Instruct patients to discontinue varenicline tablets and immediately seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. 6.2 ), Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.8 Serious Skin Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of rare but serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and erythema multiforme, in patients using varenicline tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( As these skin reactions can be life-threatening, instruct patients to stop taking varenicline tablets and contact a healthcare provider immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash with mucosal lesions or any other signs of hypersensitivity. 6.2 )]. 5.9  Nausea Nausea was the most common adverse reaction reported with varenicline tablets treatment. Nausea was generally described as mild or moderate and often transient; however, for some patients, it was persistent over several months. The incidence of nausea was dose-dependent. Initial dose-titration was beneficial in reducing the occurrence of nausea. For patients treated to the maximum recommended dose of 1 mg twice daily following initial dosage titration, the incidence of nausea was 30% compared with 10% in patients taking a comparable placebo regimen. In patients taking varenicline tablets 0.5 mg twice daily following initial titration, the incidence was 16% compared with 11% for placebo. Approximately 3% of patients treated with varenicline tablets 1 mg twice daily in studies involving 12 weeks of treatment discontinued treatment prematurely because of nausea. For patients with intolerable nausea, a dose reduction should be considered",

The treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients dosed with 1 mg twice daily was 12% for varenicline tablets, compared to 10% for placebo in studies of three months\u2019 treatment. In this group, the discontinuation rates that are higher than placebo for the most common adverse events in varenicline-treated patients were as follows: nausea (3% vs. 0.5% for placebo), insomnia (1.2% vs. 1.1% for placebo), and abnormal dreams (0.3% vs. 0.2% for placebo). Smoking cessation, with or without treatment, is associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms and has also been associated with the exacerbation of underlying psychiatric illness. Most common adverse reactions (>5% and twice the rate seen in placebo-treated patients) were nausea, abnormal (e.g., vivid, unusual, or strange) dreams, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting. ( 6 .)

During the premarketing development of varenicline tablets, over 4500 subjects were exposed to varenicline tablets, with over 450 treated for at least 24 weeks and approximately 100 for a year. Most study participants were treated for 12 weeks or less. The most common adverse event associated with varenicline tablets treatment is nausea, occurring in 30% of patients treated at the recommended dose, compared with 10% in patients taking a comparable placebo regimen [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. Table 1 shows the adverse events for varenicline tablets and placebo in the 12-week fixed dose premarketing studies with titration in the first week [Studies 2 (titrated arm only), 4, and 5]. Adverse events were categorized using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 7.1). MedDRA High Level Group Terms (HLGT) reported in \u2265 5% of patients in the varenicline tablet 1 mg twice daily dose group, and more commonly than in the placebo group, are listed, along with subordinate Preferred Terms (PT) reported in \u2265 1% of varenicline patients (and at least 0.5% more frequent than placebo). Closely related Preferred Terms such as \u2018Insomnia\u2019, \u2018Initial insomnia\u2019, \u2018Middle insomnia\u2019, \u2018Early morning awakening\u2019 were grouped, but individual patients reporting two or more grouped events are only counted once.

Following is a list of treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with varenicline tablets during all premarketing clinical trials and updated based on pooled data from 18 placebo-controlled pre- and postmarketing studies, including approximately 5,000 patients treated with varenicline. Adverse events were categorized using MedDRA, Version 16.0. The listing does not include those events already listed in the previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those events which were so general as to be uninformative, and those events reported only once which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening.

Varenicline tablets have also been studied in postmarketing trials including (1) a trial conducted in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (2) a trial conducted in generally healthy patients (similar to those in the premarketing studies) in which they were allowed to select a quit date between days 8 and 35 of treatment (\u201calternative quit date instruction trial\u201d),\u00a0(3) a trial conducted in patients who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior varenicline tablet\u00a0therapy, or who relapsed after treatment (\u201cre-treatment trial\u201d), (4) a trial conducted in patients with stable cardiovascular disease, (5) a trial conducted in patients with stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, (6) a trial conducted in patients with major depressive disorder, (7) a postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome trial in patients without or with a history of psychiatric disorder, (8) a non-treatment extension of the postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome trial that assessed CV safety, (9) a trial in patients who were not able or willing to quit abruptly and who were instructed to quit gradually (\u201cgradual approach to quitting smoking\u00a0trial\u201d). Adverse events in the trial of patients with COPD (1), in the alternative quit date instruction trial (2), and in the gradual approach to quitting smoking trial (9) were similar to those observed in premarketing studies. In the re-treatment trial (3), the profile of common adverse events was similar to that previously reported, but, in addition, varenicline-treated patients also commonly reported diarrhea (6% vs. 4% in placebo-treated patients), depressed mood disorders and disturbances (6% vs. 1%), and other mood disorders and disturbances (5% vs. 2%). In the trial of patients with stable cardiovascular disease (4), more types and a greater number of cardiovascular events were reported compared to premarketing studies, as shown in Table 1 and in Table 2 below.

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been reports of depression, mania, psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide in patients attempting to quit smoking while taking varenicline tablets\u00a0[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. There have been postmarketing reports of new or worsening seizures in patients treated with varenicline tablets\u00a0[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. There have been postmarketing reports of patients experiencing increased intoxicating effects of alcohol while taking varenicline tablets. Some reported neuropsychiatric events, including unusual and sometimes aggressive behavior [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and ( 5.3 )]. There have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. There have also been reports of serious skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and erythema multiforme, in patients taking varenicline tablets\u00a0[see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )]. There have been reports of myocardial infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) including ischemic and hemorrhagic events in patients taking varenicline tablets. In the majority of the reported cases, patients had pre-existing cardiovascular disease and/or other risk factors. Although smoking is a risk factor for MI and CVA, based on temporal relationship between medication use and events, a contributory role of varenicline cannot be ruled out [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. There have been reports of hyperglycemia in patients following initiation of varenicline tablets. There have been reports of somnambulism, some resulting in harmful behavior to self, others, or property in patients treated with varenicline tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )].",
