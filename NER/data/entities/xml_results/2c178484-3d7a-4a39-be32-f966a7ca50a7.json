( 5.9 ) \u2022 Severe Hypotension: Monitor during dosage initiation and titration. Avoid use of Morphine Sulfate Injection in patients with circulatory shock. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness: Monitor for sedation and respiratory depression. Avoid use of Morphine Sulfate Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. ( 5.11 ) 5.1\tAddiction, Abuse, and Misuse Morphine Sulfate Injection contains morphine, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Morphine Sulfate Injection exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9) ]. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Morphine Sulfate Injection. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Morphine Sulfate Injection, and monitor all patients receiving morphine sulfate for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Morphine Sulfate Injection, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Morphine Sulfate Injection along with intensive monitoring for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from \u200elegitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Morphine Sulfate Injection. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see . Overdosage (10) ] While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Morphine Sulfate Injection, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Because of a delay in the maximum CNS effect with intravenously administered Morphine Sulfate Injection (30 min), rapid administration may result in overdosing. The respiratory depression may be severe and could require intervention [see . Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24\u201372 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Morphine Sulfate Injection. Overdosage (10) ] To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Morphine Sulfate Injection are essential [see . Overestimating the Morphine Sulfate Injection dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.3 Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other Central Nervous System Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Morphine Sulfate Injection with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see . Drug Interactions (7) ] If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Morphine Sulfate Injection is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see . Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.4 \tNeonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Morphine Sulfate Injection for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 5.5 Cardiovascular Instability While low doses of intravenously administered morphine have little effect on cardiovascular stability, high doses are excitatory, resulting from sympathetic hyperactivity and increase in circulatory catecholamines. Have naloxone injection and resuscitative equipment immediately available for use in case of life-threatening or intolerable side effects and whenever morphine therapy is being initiated. 5.6 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic \u200eparadoxically causes an increase in \u200epain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. \u200eThis condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for \u200eincreasing doses of \u200eopioids to maintain a defined effect [see . Symptoms of OIH \u200e\u200einclude (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage \u200eincrease, decreased \u200elevels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from \u200eordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). \u200eThese symptoms may suggest OIH only \u200eif there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid \u200etolerance, \u200eopioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.\u200e Dependence (9.3) ] Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of \u200eopioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, \u200emultiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests \u200ea strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If \u200ea patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately \u200edecreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely \u200eswitching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and \u200eAdministration (2.4) , .\u200e Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] 5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Morphine Sulfate Injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Morphine Sulfate Injection-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Morphine Sulfate Injection [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Morphine Sulfate Injection and when Morphine Sulfate Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] 5.8 Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. Morphine Sulfate Injection should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. 5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.10 Severe Hypotension Morphine Sulfate Injection may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see . Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Morphine Sulfate Injection. In patients with circulatory shock, Morphine Sulfate Injection may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Morphine Sulfate Injection in patients with circulatory shock. Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Morphine Sulfate Injection may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for worsening of signs of increasing intracranial pressure.\u200e Monitor patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Morphine Sulfate Injection. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Morphine Sulfate Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Morphine Sulfate Injection is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The morphine in Morphine Sulfate Injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The morphine in Morphine Sulfate Injection may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Morphine Sulfate Injection therapy. Excitation of the central nervous system, resulting in convulsions, may accompany high doses of morphine given intravenously. 5.14 Withdrawal Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Morphine Sulfate Injection. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see . Drug Interactions (7) ] When discontinuing Morphine Sulfate Injection in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage [see Do not abruptly discontinue Morphine Sulfate Injection in these patients Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3) ]. 5.15 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Morphine Sulfate Injection may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Morphine Sulfate Injection and know how they will react to the medication.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: \u2022 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Interactions with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Cardiovascular Instability [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] \u2022 Severe Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] \u2022 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] \u2022 Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] \u2022 Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of morphine were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious adverse reactions associated with Morphine Sulfate Injection included respiratory depression, apnea, and to a lesser degree, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. Rarely, anaphylactoid reactions have been reported when morphine or other phenanthrene alkaloids of opium are administered intravenously. The most frequently observed adverse reactions included sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diaphoresis. Other possible adverse reactions included: Central Nervous System \u2013 Euphoria, dysphoria, weakness, headache, agitation, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, visual disturbances, transient hallucinations and disorientation. Gastrointestinal \u2013 Constipation, biliary tract spasm. Cardiovascular \u2013 Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope, and orthostatic hypotension. Genitourinary \u2013 Oliguria and urinary retention; an antidiuretic effect has been reported. Allergic \u2013 Pruritus, urticaria, and skin rashes. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported following intravenous administration. Other \u2013 Opioid-induced histamine release may be responsible for the flushing of the face, diaphoresis, and pruritus often seen with these drugs. Wheals and urticaria at the site of injection are probably related to histamine release. Local tissue irritation, pain and induration have been reported following repeated subcutaneous injection. Morphine may alter temperature regulation in susceptible individuals and will depress the cough reflex. Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Morphine Sulfate Injection. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see . Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] Hyperalgesia and Allodynia : Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been \u200ereported with opioid therapy \u200eof any duration [see Warnings and Precautions \u200e\u200e(5.6) ] \u200e.\u200e Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients \u200etaking opioids. Most reports were in \u200epatients with at least one \u200epredisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes).\u200e The most serious adverse reactions encountered are respiratory depression, apnea, circulatory depression, respiratory arrest, shock, and cardiac arrest. Other common frequently observed adverse reactions include: sedation, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diaphoresis.
