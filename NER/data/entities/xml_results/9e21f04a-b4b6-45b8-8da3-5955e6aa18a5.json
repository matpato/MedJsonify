    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS : Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease\u00a0( Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease 5.2 ). : Monitor blood pressure and pulse ( Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate 5.3 ). Prior to initiating dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. If new psychotic or manic symptoms occur, consider discontinuing dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets\u00a0( Psychiatric Adverse Reactions : 5.4 ). Priapism : If abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections occur, patients should seek immediate medical attention\u00a0( 5.5 ). Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon : Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy\u00a0( 5.6 ). Long-Term Suppression of Growth Closely monitor growth (height and weight) in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted\u00a0( in Pediatric Patients : 5.7 ). Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma : Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., patients with significant hyperopia) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist ( 5.8 ). Increased Intraocular Pressure (IOP) and Glaucoma : Prescribe dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride\u00a0tablets to patients with open-angle glaucoma or abnormally increased IOP only if the benefit of treatment is considered to outweigh the risk. Closely monitor patients with a history of increased IOP or open angle glaucoma ( 5.9 ). Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome : Before initiating dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Regularly monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate ( 5.10 ). 5.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets have a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( . Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, can result in overdose and death 9.2 )] [see Overdosage ( , and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. 10 )] Before prescribing dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets to anyone else. Throughout dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment, reassess each patient\u2019s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. 5.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risks to Patients With Serious Cardiac Disease Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. 5.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 beats per minute). Some patients\u00a0may have larger increases. Monitor all dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients for hypertension and tachycardia. 5.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Preexisting Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a preexisting psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed mood episode in patients. Prior to initiating dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression). New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic, or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.\u00a0If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets. 5.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Priapism Prolonged and painful erections, sometimes requiring surgical intervention, have been reported with methylphenidate use in both adult and pediatric male patients. Although priapism was not reported with methylphenidate initiation, it developed after some time on methylphenidate, often subsequent to an increase in dosage. Priapism also occurred during methylphenidate withdrawal (drug holidays or during discontinuation). Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention. 5.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon CNS stimulants, including dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included\u00a0digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports and at the therapeutic dosages of CNS stimulants\u00a0in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or discontinuation of the CNS stimulant. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. 5.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long-Term Suppression of Growth\u00a0in Pediatric Patients CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Careful follow-up of weight and height in patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that pediatric patients who received methylphenidate for 7 days per week throughout the year had a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this development period. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated pediatric patients. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. 5.8\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Acute Angle\nClosure Glaucoma There have been reports of angle closure glaucoma associated with methylphenidate treatment. Although the mechanism is not clear, dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients considered at risk for acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., patients with significant hyperopia) should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. 5.9\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Increased\nIntraocular Pressure and Glaucoma There have been reports of an elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with methylphenidate treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] Prescribe dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets to patients with open-angle glaucoma or abnormally increased IOP only if the benefit of treatment is considered to outweigh the risk. Closely monitor dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients with a history of abnormally increased IOP or open angle glaucoma. 5.10\u00a0 \u00a0Motor\nand Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette\u2019s syndrome has also been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] Before initiating dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Regularly monitor dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.",

Adverse Reactions in Studies with Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride Tablets\u00a0in Pediatric Patients with ADHD The safety data in this section is based on data related to dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets\u00a0exposure during the premarketing development program in a total of 696 participants in clinical trials (684 patients, 12 healthy adult subjects). These participants received\u00a0dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets\u00a05, 10, or 20 mg/day. The 684 ADHD patients (ages 6 to 17 years) were evaluated in 2 controlled clinical studies, 2 clinical pharmacology studies, and 2 open-label long-term safety studies. Most Common Adverse Reactions (incidence of greater than or equal to 5% and at least twice placebo): abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, and nausea Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation: Overall, 50 of 684 (7.3%) pediatric patients treated with dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets\u00a0experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in discontinuation. The most common reasons for discontinuation were twitching (described as motor or vocal tics), anorexia, insomnia, and tachycardia (approximately 1% each). Table 1 enumerates adverse reactions for two, placebo-controlled, parallel group studies in pediatric patients with ADHD taking dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets\u00a0doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/day. The table includes only those reactions that occurred in patients treated with dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride tablets for which the incidence was at least 5% and twice the incidence among placebo-treated patients.
