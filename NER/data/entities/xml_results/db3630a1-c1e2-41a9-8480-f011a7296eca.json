    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS PERJETA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pertuzumab or to any of its excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. PERJETA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pertuzumab or to any of its excipients. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-Related Reactions: PERJETA can cause serious infusion reactions, including fatal events:  Monitor for signs and symptoms.  If a significant infusion-associated reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapies. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis: PERJETA can cause hypersensitivity reactions, including  anaphylaxis:  Monitor for signs and symptoms, including angioedema.  If a severe hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis occurs, discontinue the infusion immediately and administer appropriate medical therapies. ( 5.4 ) 5.1\tLeft Ventricular Dysfunction PERJETA can cause left ventricular dysfunction, including symptomatic heart failure.  Decreases in LVEF have been reported with drugs that block HER2 activity, including PERJETA. Assess LVEF prior to initiation of PERJETA and at regular intervals during treatment to ensure that LVEF is within normal limits. If the LVEF declines and has not improved, or has declined further at the subsequent assessment, consider permanent discontinuation of PERJETA and trastuzumab [see . Dosage Modification for Adverse Reactions (2.5) ] In the PERJETA-treated patients with MBC in CLEOPATRA, left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 4% of patients and symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) (congestive heart failure) occurred in 1% of patients.  Patients who received prior anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest area may be at higher risk of decreased LVEF or left ventricular dysfunction. In patients receiving PERJETA as a neoadjuvant treatment in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel in NeoSphere, LVEF decline > 10% and a drop to < 50% occurred in 2% of patients and left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 0.9% of patients. LVEF recovered to \u2265 50% in all  these patients. In patients receiving neoadjuvant PERJETA in TRYPHAENA, LVEF decline > 10% and a drop to < 50% occurred in 7% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel, 16% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, and 11% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH. Left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 6% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel, 4% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, and 3% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH. Symptomatic LVSD occurred in 4% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC, 1% of patients treated with PERJETA in combination with TCH, and none of the patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and FEC followed by PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel.  LVEF recovered to \u2265 50% in all but one patient. In patients receiving neoadjuvant PERJETA in BERENICE, in the neoadjuvant period, LVEF decline \u2265 10% and a drop to < 50% as measured by ECHO/MUGA assessment occurred in 7% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel following ddAC, and 2% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC. Ejection fraction decreased (asymptomatic LVD) occurred in 7% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel following ddAC and 4% of the patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC in the neoadjuvant period. Symptomatic LVSD (NYHA Class III/IV Congestive Heart Failure) occurred in 2% of patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and paclitaxel following ddAC and none of the patients treated with PERJETA plus trastuzumab and docetaxel following FEC in the neoadjuvant period. In patients receiving adjuvant PERJETA in APHINITY, the incidence of symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV) with a LVEF decline \u2265 10% and a drop to < 50% was 0.6%.  Of the patients who experienced symptomatic heart failure, 47% of PERJETA-treated patients had recovered (defined as 2 consecutive LVEF measurements above 50%) at the data cutoff. The majority of the events (86%) were reported in anthracycline-treated patients. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (NYHA Class II) declines in LVEF \u2265 10% and a drop to < 50% were reported in 3% of PERJETA-treated patients, of whom 80% recovered at the data cutoff. PERJETA has not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF value of  < 50%, a prior history of CHF, decreases in LVEF to < 50% during prior trastuzumab therapy, or conditions that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure to > 360 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin or its equivalent. 5.2\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, PERJETA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. PERJETA is a HER2/neu receptor antagonist.  Cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death have been reported with use of another HER2/neu receptor antagonist (trastuzumab) during pregnancy.  In an animal reproduction study, administration of pertuzumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis resulted in oligohydramnios, delayed fetal kidney development, and embryo-fetal death at exposures 2.5 to 20 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose, based on C max . Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of PERJETA.  Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm, including embryo-fetal death or birth defects.  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] 5.3\tInfusion-Related Reactions PERJETA can cause serious infusion reactions, including fatal events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In CLEOPATRA, on the first day, when only PERJETA was administered, infusion-related reactions occurred in 13% of patients and < 1% were Grade 3 or 4.  The most common infusion reactions (\u2265 1%) were pyrexia, chills, fatigue, headache, asthenia, hypersensitivity, and vomiting.  During the second cycle when all drugs were administered on the same day, the most common infusion reactions in the PERJETA-treated group (\u2265 1%) were fatigue, dysgeusia, hypersensitivity, myalgia, and vomiting. In APHINITY, when PERJETA was administered in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy on the same day, infusion-related reactions occurred in 21% of patients with <1% of patients experiencing Grade 3-4 events. Observe patients closely for 60 minutes after the first infusion and for 30 minutes after subsequent infusions of PERJETA.  If a significant infusion-related reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion, and administer appropriate medical therapies.  Monitor patients carefully until complete resolution of signs and symptoms.  Consider permanent discontinuation in patients with severe infusion reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 5.4\tHypersensitivity Reactions/Anaphylaxis PERJETA can cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. In CLEOPATRA, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis reactions was 11% in PERJETA-treated patients, with Grade 3 \u2013 4 hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis occurring in 2% of patients. In NeoSphere, TRYPHAENA, BERENICE, and APHINITY, hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis events were consistent with those observed in CLEOPATRA.  In APHINITY, the overall frequency of hypersensitivity/anaphylaxis was 5% in the PERJETA treated group.  The incidence was highest in the PERJETA plus TCH treated group (8%) with 1% Grade 3 \u2013 4 events. Observe patients closely for hypersensitivity reactions.  Severe hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis and fatal events, have been observed in patients treated with PERJETA [see .  Angioedema has been described in post-marketing reports. Medications to treat such reactions, as well as emergency equipment, should be available for immediate use prior to administration of PERJETA.  PERJETA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pertuzumab or to any of its excipients Clinical Trials Experience (6.1) ] [see Contraindications (4) ].",

Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) CLEOPATRA The safety of PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel was evaluated in a randomized trial (CLEOPATRA) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer [see .  Patients received either PERJETA administered at an initial dose of 840 mg followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks thereafter or placebo in combination with trastuzumab (initial dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks thereafter) and docetaxel (75 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for 6 cycles).  The median duration of study treatment was 18.1 months for patients in the PERJETA-treated group. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Permanent discontinuation of PERJETA, trastuzumab, and docetaxel due to adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients.  Adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation of PERJETA, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in >1% of patients were left ventricular dysfunction. The safety profile of PERJETA remained unchanged with an additional 2.75 years of follow-up (median total follow-up of 50 months) in CLEOPATRA. The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) with PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel were diarrhea, alopecia, neutropenia, nausea, fatigue, rash, and peripheral neuropathy.  The most common Grade 3 \u2013 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, asthenia, and fatigue.  An increased incidence of febrile neutropenia was observed for Asian patients in both treatment arms compared with patients of other races and from other geographic regions.  Among Asian patients, the incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the pertuzumab-treated group (26%) compared with the placebo-treated group (12%).

Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer NeoSphere The safety of PERJETA was evaluated in a randomized trial (NeoSphere) in patients with operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory HER2-positive breast cancer (T2-4d) who were scheduled for neoadjuvant therapy [see . Clinical Studies (14.2) ] In combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel, PERJETA was given intravenously at an initial dose of 840 mg, followed by 420 mg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles.  After surgery, patients in the PERJETA plus trastuzumab arm received docetaxel every 3 weeks for 4 cycles prior to FEC. Permanent discontinuation of neoadjuvant PERJETA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 0.9% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were alopecia, neutropenia, diarrhea, and nausea.  The most common Grade 3 \u2013 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, and diarrhea.

Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer APHINITY The safety of PERJETA was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (APHINITY) conducted in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who had their primary tumor excised prior to randomization [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Patients were randomized to receive either PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Investigators selected one of three anthracycline-based or non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens for patients. PERJETA and trastuzumab were administered intravenously every 3 weeks starting on Day 1 of the first taxane-containing cycle, for a total of 52 weeks (up to 18 cycles) or until recurrence, withdrawal of consent, or unmanageable toxicity. Serious adverse reactions (hospitalization) due to diarrhea in the PERJETA-treated group was 2.4%.  The incidence of diarrhea was higher when chemotherapy was administered with PERJETA (61%) and was higher when administered with non-anthracycline based therapy (85%) than with anthracycline based therapy (67%).  The median duration of diarrhea was 8 days. The median duration of Grade \u22653 diarrhea was 20 days.  The incidence of diarrhea during the period PERJETA and trastuzumab were administered without chemotherapy was 18% in the PERJETA-treated group. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of any study therapy were 13% for patients in the PERJETA-treated group. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of PERJETA was 7%.  The most common adverse reactions (>0.5%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of any study treatment were ejection fraction decreased, neuropathy peripheral, diarrhea, and cardiac failure. When PERJETA was administered in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy, the most common adverse reactions (> 30%) were diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and vomiting. The most common Grade 3 \u2013 4 adverse reactions (> 2%) were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, neutrophil count decreased, anemia, white blood cell count decreased, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, and stomatitis. Table 7 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 10% of patients who received adjuvant PERJETA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy followed by PERJETA and trastuzumab for a total of 52 weeks (up to 18 cycles) or until recurrence, withdrawal of consent, or unmanageable toxicity.
