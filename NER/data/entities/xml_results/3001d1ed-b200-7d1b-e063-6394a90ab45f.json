    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Bleeding: Use with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or anticoagulant use. ( 5.1 ) Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Use a 250 mg dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 8.6 ) Injection Site Reaction: Use caution while administering Fulvestrant injection at the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol: Fulvestrant injection can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay, resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Because Fulvestrant injection is administered intramuscularly, it should be used with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses, thrombocytopenia, or anticoagulant use. 5.2 Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of Fulvestrant injection were evaluated in a study in seven subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class B ) and seven subjects with normal hepatic function. Exposure was increased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, therefore a dose of 250 mg is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . Fulvestrant injection has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child-Pugh class C ) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) ] . 5.3 Injection Site Reaction Injection site related events including sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy have been reported with Fulvestrant injection. Caution should be taken while administering Fulvestrant injection at the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Fulvestrant injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of fulvestrant to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at daily doses that are significantly less than the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Fulvestrant injection and for one year after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) , ( 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ] 5.5 Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol Due to structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol, Fulvestrant injection can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay, resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Injection Site Reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] The most common adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of patients receiving Fulvestrant injection 500 mg were: injection site pain, nausea, bone pain, arthralgia, headache, back pain, fatigue, pain in extremity, hot flash, vomiting, anorexia, asthenia, musculoskeletal pain, cough, dyspnea, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) Increased hepatic enzymes ( ALT, AST, ALP ) occurred in >15% of Fulvestrant injection patients and were not dose-dependent. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Monotherapy Comparison of Fulvestrant 500 mg and Fulvestrant 250 mg ( CONFIRM ) The following adverse reactions ( ARs ) were calculated based on the safety analysis of CONFIRM comparing the administration of Fulvestrant 500 mg intramuscularly once a month with Fulvestrant 250 mg intramuscularly once a month. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the fulvestrant 500 mg group were injection site pain ( 11.6% of patients ) , nausea ( 9.7% of patients ) , and bone pain ( 9.4% of patients ) ; the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the fulvestrant 250 mg group were nausea ( 13.6% of patients ) , back pain ( 10.7% of patients ) , and injection site pain ( 9.1% of patients ) . Table 1 lists adverse reactions reported with an incidence of 5% or greater, regardless of assessed causality, from CONFIRM.

Grade 3-4 increases were observed in 1-2% of patients. The incidence and severity of increased hepatic enzymes ( ALT, AST, ALP ) did not differ between the 250 mg and the 500 mg Fulvestrant arms. Comparison of Fulvestrant 500 mg and Anastrozole 1 mg ( FALCON ) The safety of Fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg was evaluated in FALCON. The data described below reflect exposure to Fulvestrant in 228 out of 460 patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated with endocrine therapy who received at least one ( 1 ) dose of treatment in FALCON. Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 4 of 228 ( 1.8% ) patients receiving Fulvestrant, and in 3 of 232 ( 1.3% ) patients receiving anastrozole. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving Fulvestrant included drug hypersensitivity ( 0.9% ) , injection site hypersensitivity ( 0.4% ) and elevated liver enzymes ( 0.4% ) . The most common adverse reactions ( \u226510% ) of any grade reported in patients in the Fulvestrant arm were arthralgia, hot flash, fatigue, and nausea. Adverse reactions reported in patients who received Fulvestrant in FALCON at an incidence of \u22655% in either treatment arm are listed in Table 2 , and laboratory abnormalities are listed in Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. For Fulvestrant injection 250 mg, other adverse reactions reported as drug-related and seen infrequently ( <1% ) include thromboembolic phenomena, myalgia, vertigo, leukopenia, and hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria. Vaginal bleeding has been reported infrequently ( <1% ) , mainly in patients during the first 6 weeks after changing from existing hormonal therapy to treatment with Fulvestrant injection. If bleeding persists, further evaluation should be considered. Elevation of bilirubin, elevation of gamma GT, hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported infrequently ( <1% ) .",
