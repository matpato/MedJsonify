( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Uterine Rupture, Abortion, Premature Birth, or Birth Defects with Misoprostol and Embryo-Fetal Toxicity with NSAIDs Misoprostol Administration of misoprostol, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, to pregnant women can cause uterine rupture, abortion, premature birth, or birth defects. Uterine rupture has occurred when misoprostol was administered to pregnant women to induce labor or an abortion. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in pregnant women. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are not recommended in women of childbearing potential. Patients must be advised of the abortifacient property and warned not to give the drug to others [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed, verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment and advise the use effective contraception during treatment with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.3 )] Diclofenac Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] 5.2 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as diclofenac, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol\u00a0delayed-release tablets in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol\u00a0delayed-release tablets are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.3 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. \u2022 Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. \u2022 Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. \u2022 If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. \u2022 In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] 5.4 Hepatotoxicity In clinical trials with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, meaningful elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT], more than 3 times the upper limit of the normal range [ULN]) occurred in 1.6% of 2,184 patients treated with \u00a0diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and in 1.4% of 1,691 patients treated with diclofenac sodium. These increases were generally transient, and enzyme levels returned to within the normal range upon discontinuation of therapy with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. The misoprostol component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets does not appear to exacerbate the hepatic effects caused by the diclofenac sodium component. In clinical trials of diclofenac-containing products, meaningful elevations (i.e., more than 3 times the ULN) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) occurred in about 2% of approximately 5,700 patients at some time during diclofenac treatment (ALT was not measured in all studies). In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3,700 patients treated with oral diclofenac sodium for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1,200 patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Meaningful elevations of ALT and/or AST occurred in about 4% of patients and included marked elevations (i.e., greater than 8 times the ULN) in about 1% of the 3,700 patients. In that open-label study, a higher incidence of borderline (less than 3 times the ULN), moderate (3 to 8 times the ULN), and marked (greater than 8 times the ULN) elevations of ALT or AST was observed in patients receiving diclofenac when compared to other NSAIDs. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac associated drug-induced liver injury with current use compared with non-use of diclofenac were associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days. Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine, etc.), diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets should be discontinued immediately. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., antibiotics, anti-epileptics). 5.5 Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.6 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists\u2019 Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalizations for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions (e.g., diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. 5.7 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( Avoid the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. 7 )]. Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.8 Anaphylactic Reactions Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to the individual components of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [see Contraindications ( . 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.9 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [see Contraindications ( . When diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are used in patients with preexisting asthma (without known aspirin sensitivity), monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. 4 )] 5.10 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. NSAIDs can also cause fixed drug eruption (FDE). FDE may present as a more severe variant known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE), which can be life-threatening.\u00a0These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.11 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including diclofenac a component diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), and SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of diclofenac, a component of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 , 5.7 )]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] \u2022 Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are: abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, alanine aminotransferase increased, hematocrit decreased ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Micro Labs USA Inc. at 1-855-839-8195 or \u00a0FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reaction information for diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets is derived from multinational controlled clinical trials in over 2,000 patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 50 mg/200 mcg or diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets 75 mg/200 mcg, as well as from blinded, controlled trials of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and misoprostol tablets. Gastrointestinal GI disorders had the highest reported incidence of adverse reactions for patients receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. These events were generally minor, but led to discontinuation of therapy in 9% of patients on diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets and 5% of patients on diclofenac sodium. For GI ulcer rates, [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. GI disorder Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol Delayed-Release Tablets Diclofenac Sodium Abdominal pain 21% 15% Diarrhea 19% 11% Dyspepsia 14% 11% Nausea 11% 6% Flatulence 9% 4% Diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets can cause more abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms than diclofenac alone. Diarrhea and abdominal pain developed early in the course of therapy, and were usually self-limited (resolved after 2 to 7 days). Rare instances of profound diarrhea leading to severe dehydration have been reported in patients receiving misoprostol. Patients with an underlying condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, or those in whom dehydration, were it to occur, would be dangerous, should be monitored carefully if diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets are prescribed. The incidence of diarrhea can be minimized by administering diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets with food and by avoiding co-administration with magnesium-containing antacids. Gynecological Gynecological disorders previously reported with misoprostol use have also been reported for women receiving diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets (see below). Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding may be related to administration of diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets. If it occurs, diagnostic workup should be undertaken to rule out gynecological pathology [see Boxed Warnings, Contraindications ( . 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] Other adverse experiences reported occasionally with diclofenac sodium and misoprostol delayed-release tablets, diclofenac or other NSAIDs, or misoprostol are: Body as a whole: asthenia, fatigue, malaise.
