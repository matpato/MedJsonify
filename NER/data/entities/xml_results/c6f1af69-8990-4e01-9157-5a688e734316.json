As an opioid, Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see ]. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets, and reassess\u00a0all patients receiving Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and\u00a0proper use of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets along with frequent reevaluation\u00a0for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see ]. WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients ]. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see ]. Carbon dioxide (CO OVERDOSAGE 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets are essential [see ]. Overestimating the Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Accidental ingestion of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of pentazocine. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see ]. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of other CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see ].

PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see ]. WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION; Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Advise both\u00a0patients\u00a0and\u00a0caregivers\u00a0about\u00a0the\u00a0risks of respiratory\u00a0depression\u00a0and\u00a0sedation\u00a0when Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0are\u00a0used with\u00a0benzodiazepines\u00a0or other\u00a0CNS depressants\u00a0(including\u00a0alcohol\u00a0and illicit\u00a0drugs).

Drug Interactions Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see . PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients, Pregnancy ] Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation\nand Mitigation Strategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 800-503-0784, or log on to www.opioidanalgesicrems.com. The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint. Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see . Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Dependence ] Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic, or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see . Dosage and Administration , Warning ] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Pentazocine and naloxone-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0[see ] WARNINGS . Elderly, Cache c tic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see ] WARNINGS . Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets and when Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see ] WARNINGS . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. Severe Hypotension Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets may\u00a0cause\u00a0severe\u00a0hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope\u00a0in ambulatory\u00a0patients. There\u00a0is increased\u00a0risk in patients whose ability\u00a0to maintain blood pressure\u00a0has already\u00a0been compromised by\u00a0a reduced blood volume\u00a0or concurrent administration of certain CNS\u00a0depressant drugs\u00a0(e.g., phenothiazines or\u00a0general anesthetics)\u00a0[see ] PRECAUTIONS;\u00a0Information\u00a0for\u00a0Patients . Regularly evaluate\u00a0these\u00a0patients for\u00a0signs of\u00a0hypotension after\u00a0initiating\u00a0or\u00a0titrating\u00a0the\u00a0dosage\u00a0of\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets.\u00a0In patients with circulatory\u00a0shock, Pentazocine and\u00a0Naloxone\u00a0Tablets may\u00a0cause\u00a0vasodilation that can further\u00a0reduce\u00a0cardiac\u00a0output and blood pressure. Avoid the\u00a0use\u00a0of\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets in patients with circulatory\u00a0shock. Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may\u00a0be\u00a0susceptible\u00a0to the\u00a0intracranial effects of\u00a0CO 2 retention (e.g., those\u00a0with evidence\u00a0of\u00a0increased intracranial pressure\u00a0or\u00a0brain tumors), Pentazocine\u00a0and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets may\u00a0reduce respiratory\u00a0drive, and the\u00a0resultant CO 2 retention can\u00a0further\u00a0increase\u00a0intracranial pressure. Monitor\u00a0such patients for\u00a0signs of\u00a0sedation and respiratory\u00a0depression, particularly when initiating\u00a0therapy\u00a0with Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets. Opioids may\u00a0also obscure\u00a0the clinical course\u00a0in a\u00a0patient with a\u00a0head injury. Avoid the\u00a0use\u00a0of Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness\u00a0or coma. Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets are contraindicated in patients with known or\u00a0suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including\u00a0paralytic\u00a0ileus. The administration of\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets or\u00a0other\u00a0opioids\u00a0may\u00a0obscure\u00a0the diagnosis or\u00a0clinical course\u00a0in patients with acute\u00a0abdominal conditions. Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets may\u00a0cause\u00a0spasm of\u00a0the\u00a0sphincter\u00a0of\u00a0Oddi. Opioids may\u00a0cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate\u00a0patients with biliary\u00a0tract disease, including\u00a0acute pancreatitis, for\u00a0worsening\u00a0symptoms. Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The pentazocine in Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets therapy. Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ]. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Additionally, the use of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets, a mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesic, in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid concomitant use of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets with a full opioid agonist analgesic. Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets may\u00a0impair\u00a0the\u00a0mental or\u00a0physical abilities needed to perform potentially\u00a0hazardous\u00a0activities such as driving\u00a0a car\u00a0or\u00a0operating\u00a0machinery. \u00a0Warn patients not to drive\u00a0or\u00a0operate\u00a0dangerous machinery\u00a0unless they\u00a0are\u00a0tolerant to the\u00a0effects of\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets and know how they\u00a0will react to the\u00a0medication. Acute CNS Manifestations Patients receiving therapeutic doses of Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets\u00a0have experienced hallucinations (usually visual), disorientation, and confusion which have cleared spontaneously within a period of hours. The mechanism of this reaction is not known. Such patients should be very closely observed and vital signs checked. If the drug is reinstituted, it should be done with caution since these acute CNS manifestations may recur. The amount of\u00a0naloxone\u00a0present in Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets (0.5 mg\u00a0per\u00a0tablet)\u00a0has no action when taken orally\u00a0and will not interfere\u00a0with the\u00a0pharmacologic\u00a0action of\u00a0pentazocine. However, this amount of\u00a0naloxone\u00a0given by\u00a0injection has profound antagonistic action to narcotic analgesics. Severe, even lethal, consequences may\u00a0result from misuse\u00a0of\u00a0tablets by\u00a0injection either alone\u00a0or in combination with other\u00a0substances, such\u00a0as pulmonary\u00a0emboli, vascular\u00a0occlusion, ulceration and abscesses, and withdrawal symptoms in narcotic\u00a0dependent individuals.PRECAUTIONS Porphyria Particular caution should be exercised in administering pentazocine to patients with porphyria since it may provoke an acute attack in susceptible individuals. Cardiovascular Disease Pentazocine can elevate blood pressure, possibly through the release of endogenous catecholamines. Particular caution should be exercised in conditions where alterations in vascular resistance and blood pressure might be particularly undesirable, such as in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0should be used with caution in patients with myocardial infarction who have nausea or vomiting. Imp aired Renal or Hepatic Function Decreased metabolism of pentazocine by the liver in extensive liver disease may predispose to accentuation of side effects. Although laboratory tests have not indicated that pentazocine causes or increases renal or hepatic impairment, the drug should be administered with caution to patients with such impairment. Biliary Surge ry Narcotic drug products are generally considered to elevate biliary tract pressure for varying periods following their administration. Some evidence suggests that pentazocine may differ from other marketed narcotics in this respect (i.e., it causes little or no elevation in biliary tract pressures). The clinical significance of these findings, however, is not yet known. Information for Patients Advise\u00a0the\u00a0patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Storage and Disposal: Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home. Inform patients that leaving Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home [see , WARNINGS ]. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Advise patients and caregivers that when medicines are no longer needed, they should be disposed of promptly. Expired, unwanted, or unused Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets should be disposed of by flushing the unused medication down the toilet if a drug take-back option is not readily available. Inform patients that they can visit www.fda.gov/drugdisposal for a complete list of medicines recommended for disposal by flushing, as well as additional information on disposal of unused medicines. Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Inform patients that the use of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see ]. Instruct patients not to share Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0with others and to take steps to protect Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0from theft or misuse. WARNINGS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see ]. WARNINGS; Life Threatening Respiratory Depression Accidental Ingestion Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see ]. WARNINGS Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see WARNINGS , ]. PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see ]. WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone\u2019s effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see ]. OVERDOSAGE If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers: How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings; . Adverse Reactions ] Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions I mportant Administration Instructions Instruct patients how to properly take Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. Advise patients not to adjust the dose of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets without consulting with a physician or other healthcare professional. If patients have been receiving treatment with Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets for more than a few weeks and cessation of therapy is indicated, counsel them on the importance of safely tapering the dose as abruptly discontinuation of the medication could precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Provide a dose schedule to accomplish a gradual discontinuation of the medication. [see ] DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Important Discontinuation Instructions In order to avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see ]. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Inform patients that Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see ]. PRECAUTIONS C onstipation Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see ]. ADVERSE REACTIONS , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Adrenal Insufficiency Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see ]. WARNINGS H y potension Inform patients that Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. \u00a0Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) [see ]. WARNINGS Anaphylaxis Inform patients that anaphylaxis have been reported with ingredients contained in Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention [see , CONTRAINDICATIONS ]. ADVERSE REACTIONS Pregnancy Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Inform female patients of reproductive potential that use of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated [see , WARNINGS ]. PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Inform female patients of reproductive potential that Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets can cause fetal harm and to inform the healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy Lactation Advise nursing mothers to carefully observe\u00a0infants for increased sleepiness (more than usual), breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to seek immediate medical care if they notice these signs [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Nursing Mothers Drug Interactions Benzodiazepine s and Other Centra l Nervous Syste m (CNS) Depressants Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol, benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see ] WARNINGS . Serotonergic Drugs The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone),\u00a0and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome. [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Monoa mine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0may cause CNS excitation and hypertension through their respective effects on catecholamines. Caution should therefore be observed in administering Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0to patients who are currently receiving MAOIs or who have received them within the preceding 14 days Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics such as butorphanol,\u00a0nalbuphine, pentazocine,\u00a0buprenorphine, may\u00a0reduce\u00a0the analgesic\u00a0effect of\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets and/or\u00a0precipitate\u00a0withdrawal symptoms. Avoid concomitant use\u00a0of\u00a0these\u00a0drugs. Muscle Relaxants The\u00a0Concomitant use\u00a0of\u00a0opioids and muscle relaxants may\u00a0enhance\u00a0the\u00a0neuromuscular\u00a0blocking action of\u00a0skeletal muscle\u00a0relaxants and produce\u00a0an\u00a0increased degree\u00a0of\u00a0respiratory\u00a0depression. Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see ]. WARNINGS Diuretics Opioids can reduce\u00a0the\u00a0efficacy\u00a0of\u00a0diuretics by\u00a0inducing\u00a0the\u00a0release\u00a0of\u00a0antidiuretic\u00a0hormone. Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs The concomitant use\u00a0of\u00a0anticholinergic\u00a0drugs may\u00a0increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Tobacco Smoking tobacco could enhance the metabolic clearance rate of pentazocine reducing the clinical effectiveness of a standard dose of pentazocine. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impa irment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies have\u00a0not been\u00a0completed to evaluate\u00a0the\u00a0carcinogenic\u00a0potential of\u00a0the combination or\u00a0individual components of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets. Mutagenesis Studies to evaluate the mutagenic potential of the components of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets have not been conducted. Impairment of\u00a0Fertility Studies in animals to evaluate\u00a0the\u00a0impact of\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets on fertility\u00a0have\u00a0not been completed. The\u00a0daily\u00a0administration of\u00a04 mg/kg\u00a0to 20 mg/kg\u00a0pentazocine\u00a0subcutaneously\u00a0to female\u00a0rats during\u00a0a\u00a014 day\u00a0pre-mating\u00a0period and until the\u00a013th day\u00a0of\u00a0pregnancy\u00a0did\u00a0not have any\u00a0adverse effects on the fertility\u00a0rate. Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see . ADVERSE REACTIONS ] Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during\u00a0pregnancy\u00a0can\u00a0cause\u00a0neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [see .  There\u00a0are\u00a0no\u00a0available\u00a0data\u00a0with Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets in pregnant women to inform a\u00a0drug-associated risk\u00a0for\u00a0major\u00a0birth defects and miscarriage. \u00a0In\u00a0animal reproduction studies, pentazocine administered\u00a0subcutaneously\u00a0to pregnant hamsters during the early gestational period produced neural tube\u00a0defects (i.e., exencephaly\u00a0and\u00a0cranioschisis) at 2.6 times the\u00a0maximum daily\u00a0dose (MDD). \u00a0In pregnant rats administered pentazocine:naloxone\u00a0during\u00a0organogenesis, there\u00a0were\u00a0increased incidences of resorptions and extra ribs\u00a0at 0.2 times the\u00a0MDD.  There\u00a0was no evidence\u00a0of\u00a0malformations in rats or rabbits [ ] WARNINGS s e e ].  Based on animal data, advise\u00a0pregnant women of\u00a0the\u00a0potential risk to a fetus.  The estimated background\u00a0risk of\u00a0major\u00a0birth defects and miscarriage for\u00a0the\u00a0indicated population is unknown.  All pregnancies have\u00a0a\u00a0background risk of\u00a0birth defect, loss, or\u00a0other adverse\u00a0outcomes. \u00a0In the\u00a0U.S. general population,\u00a0the estimated background risk of\u00a0major\u00a0birth defects\u00a0and miscarriage\u00a0in clinically\u00a0recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data C lini ca l C onsid era tions F e tal/ N e onatal Ad ve rse R e a c tions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome\u00a0presents as irritability, hyperactivity\u00a0and\u00a0abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry,\u00a0tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure\u00a0to\u00a0gain weight. The\u00a0onset, duration, and severity\u00a0of\u00a0neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome\u00a0vary\u00a0based on the\u00a0specific\u00a0opioid used, duration of\u00a0use, timing\u00a0and\u00a0amount of\u00a0last maternal use,\u00a0and rate\u00a0of elimination of\u00a0the\u00a0drug by\u00a0the\u00a0newborn. Observe\u00a0newborns for\u00a0symptoms\u00a0of\u00a0neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome\u00a0and manage\u00a0accordingly\u00a0[see ]. WARNINGS Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the\u00a0placenta and may\u00a0produce\u00a0respiratory\u00a0depression and psycho-physiologic\u00a0effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as\u00a0naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory\u00a0depression in the\u00a0neonate. Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets are\u00a0not recommended\u00a0for\u00a0use\u00a0in\u00a0pregnant women during or\u00a0immediately\u00a0prior\u00a0to labor, when other analgesic\u00a0techniques are\u00a0more appropriate. Opioid\u00a0analgesics, including\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets, can prolong\u00a0labor\u00a0through\u00a0actions which temporarily\u00a0reduce\u00a0the\u00a0strength, duration, and frequency\u00a0of\u00a0uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may\u00a0be offset by\u00a0an increased rate\u00a0of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor\u00a0neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during\u00a0labor for\u00a0signs of excess sedation and respiratory\u00a0depression. Data Animal Data In a published report, a single dose of pentazocine administered to pregnant hamsters on Gestation Day 8 increased the incidence of neural tube defects (exencephaly and cranioschisis) at a dose of 196 mg/kg, SC (2.6-times the maximum daily human dose (MDD) of 600 mg/day pentazocine (12 tablets) on a mg/m 2 basis). No evidence of neural tube defects were reported following a dose of 98 mg/kg (1.3 times the MDD). Animal reproduction studies testing the combination of pentazocine and naloxone during organogenesis have been completed in rats and rabbits. In rats, a pentazocine:naloxone dose of 64 mg/kg:0.64 mg/kg via oral gavage from Gestation Day 6 to 15 increased the incidences of resorptions and extra ribs (0.2 times the maximum daily human dose of pentazocine via 12 tablets on a mg/m 2 basis). There were no clear treatment related effects in rabbits treated from Gestation Day 6 to 18 with a pentazocine:naloxone dose of up to 64 mg/kg:0.64 mg/kg via oral gavage (0.3-times the maximum daily human dose of pentazocine via 12 tablets on a mg/m 2 basis). Lactation R isk S umm a r y Pentazocine\u00a0is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets are administered to a nursing woman. The\u00a0developmental\u00a0and health benefits of\u00a0breastfeeding\u00a0should be\u00a0considered along\u00a0with the mother\u2019s clinical need for\u00a0Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets and\u00a0any\u00a0potential adverse\u00a0effects on the\u00a0breastfed infant from Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets or from the\u00a0underlying\u00a0maternal condition. C lini ca l C onsid era tions Infants exposed to pentazocine and naloxone\u00a0through breast milk should be\u00a0monitored for excess sedation and respiratory\u00a0depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur\u00a0in breastfed infants when maternal administration\u00a0of an opioid analgesic\u00a0is\u00a0stopped, or\u00a0when breast-feeding\u00a0is stopped. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established. Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to Pentazocine and Naloxone\u00a0Tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Pentazocine and Naloxone Tablets\u00a0slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient [see . ] WARNINGS Pentazocine and naltrexone are\u00a0known to be\u00a0substantially\u00a0excreted by\u00a0the\u00a0kidney,\u00a0and the risk of adverse\u00a0reactions to this drug\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0greater\u00a0in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly\u00a0patients are\u00a0more\u00a0likely\u00a0to have\u00a0decreased renal function, care\u00a0should be\u00a0taken in dose selection, and it may\u00a0be\u00a0useful to regularly evaluate renal function.",
