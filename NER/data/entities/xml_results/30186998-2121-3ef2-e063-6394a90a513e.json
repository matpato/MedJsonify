            "text": "Contraindications: This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to the age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplementation. Flotrex\u2122 Chewable Multivitamin Tablets with 0.25 mg Fluoride provide 0.52 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 6-16 years of age in areas where the drinking water fluoride level is less than 0.3 ppm. Flotrex\u2122 Chewable Multivitamin Tablets with 0.25 mg Fluoride supply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. Children using Flotrex\u2122 Chewable Multivitamin Tablets with 0.25 mg Fluoride regularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Flotrex\u2122 Chewable Multivitamin Tablets with 0.25 mg Fluoride is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNING Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Caution: Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking.PRECAUTION The suggested dose of Flotrex\u2122 Chewable Multivitamin Tablets with 0.25 mg Fluoride should not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribing Flotrex\u2122 Chewable Multivitamin Tablets with 0.25 mg Fluoride: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis. Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient\u2019s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Folate: Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate. Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals but generally at levels substantially higher than those contained herein. However, allergic and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels.",
