Reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment.\u00a0( 2.3 , 8.6 ) 5.1 Acute Renal Failure Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients with underlying renal disease who have received inappropriately high doses of famciclovir for their level of renal function. Dosage reduction is recommended when administering famciclovir to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Acute renal failure is discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. The most common adverse events reported in at least 1 indication by greater than 10% of adult patients treated with famciclovir are headache and nausea. The most common adverse events reported in at least 1 indication by greater than 10% of adult patients are headache and nausea.

Immunocompetent patients: The safety of famciclovir has been evaluated in active- and placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 816 famciclovir-treated patients with herpes zoster (famciclovir, 250 mg three times daily to 750 mg three times daily), 163 famciclovir-treated patients with recurrent genital herpes (Famciclovir, 1000 mg twice daily); 1,197 patients with recurrent genital herpes treated with famciclovir as suppressive therapy (125 mg once daily to 250 mg three times daily) of which 570 patients received famciclovir (open-labeled and/or double-blind) for at least 10 months; and 447 famciclovir-treated patients with herpes labialis (Famciclovir, 1500 mg once daily or 750 mg twice daily).

HIV-infected patients : In HIV-infected patients, the most frequently reported adverse events for famciclovir (500 mg twice daily; n=150) and acyclovir (400 mg, 5x/day; n=143), respectively, were headache (17% vs. 15%), nausea (11% vs. 13%), diarrhea (7% vs. 11%), vomiting (5% vs. 4%), fatigue (4% vs. 2%), and abdominal pain (3% vs. 6%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The adverse events listed below have been reported during post-approval use of famciclovir. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Thrombocytopenia Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests, cholestatic jaundice Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock, anaphylactic reaction Nervous system disorders: Dizziness, somnolence, seizure Psychiatric disorders: Confusion (including delirium, disorientation, and confusional state occurring predominantly in the elderly), hallucinations Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema (e.g., face, eyelid, periorbital, and pharyngeal edema), hypersensitivity vasculitis Cardiac disorders: Palpitations",
