Immunocompetent patients: The safety of famciclovir has been evaluated in active- and placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 816 famciclovir-treated patients with herpes zoster (famciclovir, 250 mg three times daily to 750 mg three times daily), 163 famciclovir-treated patients with recurrent genital herpes (Famciclovir, 1000 mg twice daily); 1,197 patients with recurrent genital herpes treated with famciclovir as suppressive therapy (125 mg once daily to 250 mg three times daily) of which 570 patients received famciclovir (open-labeled and/or double-blind) for at least 10 months; and 447 famciclovir-treated patients with herpes labialis (Famciclovir, 1500 mg once daily or 750 mg twice daily).

HIV-infected patients : In HIV-infected patients, the most frequently reported adverse events for famciclovir (500 mg twice daily; n=150) and acyclovir (400 mg, 5x/day; n=143), respectively, were headache (17% vs. 15%), nausea (11% vs. 13%), diarrhea (7% vs. 11%), vomiting (5% vs. 4%), fatigue (4% vs. 2%), and abdominal pain (3% vs. 6%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The adverse events listed below have been reported during post-approval use of famciclovir. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Thrombocytopenia Hepatobiliary disorders: Abnormal liver function tests, cholestatic jaundice Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic shock, anaphylactic reaction Nervous system disorders: Dizziness, somnolence, seizure Psychiatric disorders: Confusion (including delirium, disorientation, and confusional state occurring predominantly in the elderly), hallucinations Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema (e.g., face, eyelid, periorbital, and pharyngeal edema), hypersensitivity vasculitis Cardiac disorders: Palpitations",
