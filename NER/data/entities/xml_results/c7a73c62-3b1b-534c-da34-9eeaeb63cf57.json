    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myocardial Ischemia. Fatal cardiac events have occurred. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example unstable angina or cardiovascular instability, who may be at greater risk. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administration ( 5.1 ). Sinoatrial (SA) and Atrioventricular (AV) Nodal Block. Adenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia ( 5.2 ). Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter. New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported ( 5.3 ). Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria, and rashes have occurred. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available ( 5.4 ). Hypotension. Adenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson, induce vasodilation and hypotension. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency, or hypovolemia ( 5.5 ). Hypertension. Adenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson, may induce clinically significant increases in blood pressure particularly in patients with a history of hypertension and when the MPI includes low level exercise ( 5.6 ). Bronchoconstriction. Adenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson, may induce dyspnea, bronchoconstriction and respiratory compromise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\u00a0(COPD) or asthma. Resuscitative measures should be available ( 5.7 ). Seizure. Regadenoson may lower the seizure threshold. New onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred. Some seizures are prolonged and require urgent anticonvulsive management. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience a seizure in association with regadenoson ( 5.8 ). Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke). Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Myocardial Ischemia Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest have occurred following regadenoson injection. Avoid use in patients with symptoms or signs of acute myocardial ischemia, for example unstable angina or cardiovascular instability; these patients may be at greater risk of serious cardiovascular reactions to regadenoson. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administering regadenoson. Adhere to the recommended duration of injection [see Dosage and Administration ( . As noted in an animal study, longer injection times may increase the duration and magnitude of increase in coronary blood flow 2 )] [see Clinical Pharmacology ( .\u00a0If serious reactions to regadenoson occur, consider the use of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, to shorten the duration of increased coronary blood flow induced by regadenoson 12.2 )] [see Overdosage ( . 10 )] 5.2 Sinoatrial and Atrioventricular Nodal Block Adenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second- or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In clinical trials first-degree AV block (PR prolongation > 220 msec) developed in 3% of patients within 2 hours of regadenoson administration; transient second-degree AV block with one dropped beat was observed in one patient receiving regadenoson. In post-marketing experience, third-degree heart block and asystole within minutes of regadenoson administration have occurred [ see ]. Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) 5.3\u00a0Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter New-onset or recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and atrial flutter have been reported following regadenoson injection [ see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.2) 5.4 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria and rashes have occurred. In clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in fewer than 1 percent of patients [ see ]. Have personnel and resuscitative equipment immediately available. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) 5.5 Hypotension Adenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson, induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and decreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 minutes of regadenoson administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In post-marketing experience, syncope, transient ischemic attacks and seizures have been observed [ see ]. Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) 5.6 Hypertension Administration of adenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson, may result in clinically significant increases in blood pressure in some patients. Among patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure in clinical trials, the increase was observed within minutes of regadenoson administration. Most increases resolved within 10 to 15 minutes, but in some cases, increases were observed at 45 minutes following administration [ see ]. In post-marketing experience, cases of potentially clinically significant hypertension have been reported, particularly with underlying hypertension and when low-level exercise was included in the MPI [ Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) see ]. Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) 5.7 Bronchoconstriction Adenosine receptor agonists, including regadenoson, may cause dyspnea, bronchoconstriction, and respiratory compromise. Appropriate bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures should be available prior to and following regadenoson administration  [ see ]. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ), Overdosage ( 10 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) 5.8 Seizure Regadenoson may lower the seizure threshold; obtain a seizure history. New-onset or recurrence of convulsive seizures has occurred following regadenoson injection. Some seizures are prolonged and require emergent anticonvulsive management. Aminophylline may increase the risk of seizures associated with regadenoson injection. Methylxanthine use is not recommended in patients who experience a seizure in association with regadenoson administration. 5.9 Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke) Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular accidents have occurred. Hemodynamic effects of regadenoson including hypotension or hypertension may be associated with these adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.5 ) and (5.6)",

During clinical development, 1,651 patients were exposed to regadenoson, with most receiving 0.4 mg as a rapid (\u2264 10 seconds) intravenous injection. Most of these patients received regadenoson in two clinical studies that enrolled patients who had no history of bronchospastic lung disease as well as no history of a cardiac conduction block of greater than first-degree AV block, except for patients with functioning artificial pacemakers. In these studies (Studies 1 and 2), 2,015 patients underwent myocardial perfusion imaging after administration of regadenoson injection (N = 1,337) or ADENOSCAN (N = 678). The population was 26 to 93 years of age (median 66 years), 70% male and primarily Caucasian (76% Caucasian, 7% African American, 9% Hispanic, 5% Asian). Table 1 shows the most frequently reported adverse reactions. Overall, any adverse reaction occurred at similar rates between the study groups (80% for the regadenoson group and 83% for the ADENOSCAN group). Aminophylline was used to treat the reactions in 3% of patients in the regadenoson group and 2% of patients in the ADENOSCAN group. Most adverse reactions began soon after dosing, and generally resolved within approximately 15 minutes, except for headache which resolved in most patients within 30 minutes.

Most respiratory adverse reactions resolved without therapy; a few patients received aminophylline or a short acting bronchodilator. No differences were observed between treatment arms in the reduction of >15% from baseline at two-hours in FEV 1 (Table 3).

Pre-specified respiratory adverse reactions included dyspnea, wheezing, obstructive airway disorder, dyspnea exertional, and tachypnea. 12.9% 2.3% 19% 4% Dyspnea 10.7% 1.1% 18% 2.6% Wheezing 3.1% 1.1% 0.9% 0.7% FEV 1 reduction >15% Change from baseline at 2 hours. 1.1% 2.9% 4.2% 5.4% Renal Impairment In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 504 patients (regadenoson n=334 and placebo n=170) with a diagnosis or risk factors for coronary artery disease and NKFK/DOQI Stage III or IV renal impairment (defined as GFR 15 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), no serious adverse events were reported through the 24-hour follow-up period. Inadequate Exercise Stress In an open-label, multi-center trial evaluating regadenoson administration following inadequate exercise stress, 1,147 patients were randomized into one of two groups. Each group underwent two regadenoson stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) procedures. Group 1 received regadenoson injection 3 minutes following inadequate exercise in the first regadenoson stress (MPI 1). Group 2 rested 1 hour after inadequate exercise to allow hemodynamics to return to baseline prior to receiving regadenoson injection (MPI 1). Both groups returned for a second stress MPI 1 to 14 days later and received regadenoson injection without exercise (MPI 2). The most common adverse reactions are similar in type and incidence to those in Table 1 above for both Groups. The timing of the administration of regadenoson\u00a0injection following inadequate exercise did not alter the common adverse reaction profile. Table 4 shows a comparison of cardiac events of interest for the two groups [see Warnings and Precautions ( . The cardiac events were numerically higher in Group 1. 5.1 )] Table 4 Cardiac Events of Interest in Inadequate Exercise Stress Study Cardiac Event* Group 1 / MPI 1 regadenoson 3 minutes following exercise (N=575) Group 2 / MPI 1 regadenoson 1 hour following exercise (N=567) 17 (3%) 3 (0.5%) Holter/12-Lead ECG Abnormality ST-T Depression (\u2265 2 mm) 13 (2.3%) 2 (0.4%) ST-T Elevation (\u2265 1 mm) 3 (0.5%) 1 (0.2%) Acute coronary syndrome 1 (0.2%) 0 Myocardial infarction 1 (0.2%) 0 *A clinically significant cardiac event was defined as any of the following events found on the Holter ECG/12-lead ECG within one hour after regadenoson administration: ventricular arrhythmias (sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, Torsade de Pointes, ventricular flutter); ST-T depression (\u2265 2 mm); ST-T elevation (\u2265 1 mm); AV block (2:1 AV block, AV Mobitz I, AV Mobitz II, complete heart block); sinus arrest > 3 seconds in duration Or \u2022 a Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) per the MedDRA SMQ (narrow Scope) for myocardial\u00a0infarction Or \u2022 a TEAE preferred term (PT) of angina unstable within 24 hours of regadenoson\u00a0administration. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide marketing experience with regadenoson. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular Myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (new-onset or recurrent), atrial flutter, heart block (including third-degree block), asystole, marked hypertension, symptomatic hypotension in association with transient ischemic attack, acute coronary syndrome (ACS),\u00a0seizures and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions ( have been reported. Some events required intervention with fluids and/or aminophylline [see Overdosage (10)]. QTc\u00a0prolongation shortly after regadenoson administration has been reported. 5.1 ), ( 5.2 ), ( 5.3 ), ( 5.5 ), ( 5.6 ) and ( 5.8 )] Central Nervous System Tremor, seizure, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident including intracranial hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.8 ) and ( 5.9 )] Gastrointestinal Abdominal pain, occasionally severe, has been reported a few minutes after regadenoson administration, in association with nausea, vomiting, or myalgias; administration of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, appeared to lessen the pain. Diarrhea and fecal incontinence have also been reported following regadenoson administration. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis, angioedema, cardiac or respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, hypotension, throat tightness, urticaria, rashes have occurred and have required treatment including resuscitation [ see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.4) Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal pain has occurred, typically 10 to 20 minutes after regadenoson administration; the pain was occasionally severe, localized in the arms and lower back and extended to the buttocks and lower legs bilaterally. Administration of aminophylline appeared to lessen the pain. Respiratory Respiratory arrest, dyspnea and wheezing have been reported following regadenoson administration.",
