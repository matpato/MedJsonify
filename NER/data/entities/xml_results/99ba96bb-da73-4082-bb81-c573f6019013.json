Avoid alcohol and hepatotoxic agents, including herbal supplements and drugs other than bedaquiline and linezolid [see Indications and Usage (1) ] while on Pretomanid Tablets, especially in patients with impaired hepatic function. Monitor symptoms and signs (such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, and hepatomegaly) and laboratory tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) at a minimum at baseline, at two weeks, and then monthly while on treatment and as needed.  If evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction occurs, test for viral hepatitides and discontinue other hepatotoxic medications.  Interrupt treatment with the entire regimen if: \u2022 Aminotransferase elevations are accompanied by total bilirubin elevation greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal. \u2022 Aminotransferase elevations are greater than 8 times the upper limit of normal. \u2022 Aminotransferase elevations are greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal and persist beyond 2\u00a0weeks. 5.3 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression (including anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia) was reported with the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid. Myelosuppression is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. Anemia can be life threatening [see . When linezolid dosing, as part of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid, was reduced, interrupted, or discontinued, the observed hematologic abnormalities were reversible. Complete blood counts should be monitored at a minimum at baseline, at two weeks, and then monthly in patients receiving linezolid as part of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid. Decreasing linezolid to half the initial dose or interrupting linezolid dosing should be considered in patients who develop or have worsening myelosuppression Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.4 Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy and optic neuropathy were reported with the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid [see . Neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of long-term linezolid use. Neuropathy associated with linezolid is generally reversible or improved with appropriate monitoring and interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of linezolid dosing. When improvement in the peripheral neuropathy is observed, consider resuming linezolid at half the initial dose Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Monitor visual function in all patients receiving the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid; if a patient experiences symptoms of visual impairment, interrupt linezolid dosing and obtain prompt ophthalmologic evaluation.

Obtain serum potassium, calcium, and magnesium at baseline and correct if abnormal.  Monitor these electrolytes if QT prolongation is detected [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The following may increase the risk for QT prolongation when patients are receiving bedaquiline as part of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid: a history of Torsade de Pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, ongoing hypothyroidism, ongoing bradyarrhythmia, uncompensated heart failure, or serum calcium, magnesium, or potassium levels below the lower limits of normal.  If necessary, bedaquiline treatment initiation could be considered in these patients after a favorable benefit-risk assessment and with frequent ECG monitoring. Discontinue the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid if the patient develops clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or a QTcF interval of greater than 500 ms (confirmed by repeat ECG).  If syncope occurs, obtain an ECG to detect QT prolongation. 5.6 Drug Interactions CYP3A4 Inducers Pretomanid may be in part metabolized by CYP3A4 [see Avoid co\u2011administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin or efavirenz, during treatment with pretomanid. Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.7 Reproductive Effects Pretomanid caused testicular atrophy and impaired fertility in male rats.  Advise patients of reproductive toxicities seen in animal studies and that the potential effects on human male fertility have not been adequately evaluated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 5.8 Lactic Acidosis Lactic acidosis was reported with the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] .  Lactic acidosis is a known adverse reaction of linezolid.  Patients who develop recurrent nausea or vomiting should receive immediate medical evaluation, including evaluation of bicarbonate and lactic acid levels, and interruption of linezolid or the entire combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid should be considered.",

When Pretomanid Tablets are administered in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, refer to the prescribing information for the respective drugs for a description of the adverse reactions associated with their use. Approximately 3100 subjects have been exposed to Pretomanid Tablets, either alone or as part of a combination therapy in clinical trials. The registrational trial, Trial 1 (NCT02333799), was a single-arm, open-label trial conducted in three sites in South Africa in which adult patients with pulmonary TB resistant to isoniazid, rifamycins, a fluoroquinolone and a second line injectable antibacterial drug or pulmonary TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, who were treatment-intolerant or non-responsive to standard therapy received the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid for 6 months (extendable to 9 months) with 24 months of follow-up. One hundred and nine patients were treated; 76% were black, and 23% were of mixed race.  Their ages ranged from 17 years to 60 years (mean 36 years), and all patients were from South Africa. Fifty-six (51%) patients were HIV-positive. There were 8 deaths. Six patients died while receiving treatment; all surviving patients, excluding one patient who withdrew consent, completed treatment. Two patients died during follow-up at Day 369 and Day 486, respectively. Trial 2 (NCT03086486) was a phase 3 partially-blinded, randomized trial assessing the safety and efficacy of various doses and treatment durations of linezolid in combination with Pretomanid Tablets plus bedaquiline in patients with pulmonary TB resistant to isoniazid, rifamycins, a fluoroquinolone and a second line injectable antibacterial drug, or pulmonary TB resistant to rifamycins and either a fluoroquinolone or a second line injectable antibacterial drug, or pulmonary TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin who were treatment intolerant or non-responsive to standard therapy. A total of 181 patients were randomized to one of the 4 treatment arms, Pretomanid Tablets plus bedaquiline plus either 1,200 mg or 600 mg of linezolid for 26 weeks or for 9 weeks (not an approved dosing regimen), followed by a linezolid placebo for 17 weeks. Males represented 67% of the patients in the trial and the median age of all patients was 36 years. 64% of patients were White and the remaining patients were Black (36%). The treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics. Most patients (93%) completed treatment. One patient died in the linezolid 1,200 mg for 9 weeks (not an approved dosing regimen) arm. Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Trials 1 and 2 Table 1 summarizes the incidence of select adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 5% of patients treated for 26 weeks in Trials 1 and 2.

Except for one patient who died due to pneumonia and sepsis, all patients who experienced increased transaminases were able to continue therapy and complete the full course of treatment. In Trial 2, 47 of 181 patients (26%) had one or more liver-related adverse reactions, with similar numbers in each group. Myelosuppression is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. In Trial 1, the most common hematopoietic cytopenia was anemia (37%). The majority of cytopenias began after 2 weeks of treatment. Three patients experienced cytopenias that were considered serious: neutropenia in 1 patient and anemia in 2 patients. All 3 serious adverse reactions resulted in interruption of linezolid or all components of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid, and all resolved. In Trial 2, there was a greater incidence of myelosuppression, 29% versus 13%, for the 1,200 mg compared to the 600 mg linezolid 26-week group. Most of the myelosuppression-related adverse reactions were either grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. In the combined study data for Trial 1 and Trial 2, 2 patients reported serious adverse reactions of anemia with linezolid 1,200 mg, and none were reported in the 600 mg group. Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. In Trial 1, peripheral neuropathy was reported in 81% of patients. Most of these adverse reactions (64%) occurred after 8 weeks of treatment and resulted in dosing interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of linezolid. Severe, moderate, and mild peripheral neuropathy occurred in 22%, 32%, and 26% of patients, respectively. No adverse reaction related to peripheral neuropathy led to a discontinuation of the entire study regimen. In Trial 2, 17 (38%) patients reported an adverse reaction of peripheral neuropathy in the 1,200 mg 26-week treatment group; one of these reactions led to treatment discontinuation. In the 600 mg 26-week treatment group, 10 (22%) patients reported peripheral neuropathy, and none required linezolid treatment interruption or treatment discontinuation. Optic neuropathy is a known adverse reaction of linezolid. Two patients (2%) in Trial 1 developed optic neuropathy after 16 weeks of treatment. Both were serious, confirmed on retinal examination as optic neuropathy/neuritis, and resulted in discontinuation of linezolid; both adverse reactions resolved. Overall, patients administered a linezolid dose of 600 mg twice daily had a similar safety profile to those administered a dose of 1,200 mg once daily. In Trial 2 overall, 4 (2%) patients reported an adverse reaction of optic neuropathy. All 4 patients were in the 1,200 mg linezolid 26-week treatment group (9%). The maximum severity was grade 1 (mild) for 1 patient, grade 2 (moderate) for 2 patients, and grade 3 (severe) for 1 patient. All patients had linezolid permanently discontinued except 1 patient who had already completed treatment when the adverse reaction occurred. Onset of optic neuropathy occurred after 3 months of treatment, and resolved.",
