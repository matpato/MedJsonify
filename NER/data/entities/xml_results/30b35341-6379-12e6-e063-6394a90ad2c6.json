    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypertriglyceridemia and Pancreatitis: Colesevelam hydrochloride\u00a0can increase TG. Hypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis. Monitor lipids, including TG. Instruct patients to discontinue\u00a0colesevelam hydrochloride and seek prompt medical attention if the symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur ( 5.1 ). Gastrointestinal Obstruction: Cases of bowel obstruction have occurred.\u00a0Colesevelam hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with gastroparesis, other gastrointestinal motility disorders, and in those who have had major gastrointestinal tract surgery and who may be at risk for bowel obstruction ( 5.2 ). Vitamin K or Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies : Colesevelam hydrochloride may decrease absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Patients with a susceptibility to deficiencies of vitamin K (e.g., patients on warfarin, patients with malabsorption syndromes) or other fat-soluble vitamins may be at increased risk. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride ( 5.3 ). Drug Interactions: Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs that have not been tested for interaction, consider administering at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride ( 5.4 , 7 , 12.3 ). 5.1 Hypertriglyceridemia and Pancreatitis Colesevelam hydrochloride, like other bile acid sequestrants, can increase serum TG concentrations.\u00a0Hypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis. Colesevelam hydrochloride had effects on serum TG (median increase 5% compared to placebo) in trials of patients with primary hyperlipidemia. In trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, greater increases in TG levels occurred when colesevelam hydrochloride was used as monotherapy (median increase 9.7% compared to placebo) and when colesevelam hydrochloride was used in combination with pioglitazone (median increase 11% compared to placebo in combination with pioglitazone), sulfonylureas (median increase 18% compared to placebo in combination with sulfonylureas), and insulin (median increase 22% compared to placebo in combination with insulin) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Obtain lipid parameters, including TG levels, before starting colesevelam hydrochloride and periodically thereafter. Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with TG levels > 500 mg/dL or patients with a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis [see . Patients with TG levels greater than 300 mg/dL could have greater increases in serum TG levels with colesevelam hydrochloride and may require additional TG monitoring. Instruct patients to discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride and seek prompt medical attention if the symptoms of acute pancreatitis occur (e.g., severe abdominal pain with or without nausea and vomiting). Discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride if TG levels exceed 500 mg/dL Contraindications (4) ] [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.2 Gastrointestinal Obstruction Postmarketing cases of bowel obstruction have occurred with colesevelam hydrochloride [see . Because of its constipating effects, colesevelam hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with gastroparesis, other gastrointestinal motility disorders, and in those who have had major gastrointestinal tract surgery and who may be at risk for bowel obstruction. Colesevelam hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with a history of bowel obstruction Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] [see . Instruct patients to promptly discontinue colesevelam hydrochloride and seek medical attention if severe abdominal pain or severe constipation occurs. Contraindications (4) ] Because of the tablet size, colesevelam hydrochloride tablets can cause dysphagia or esophageal obstruction. For patients with difficulty swallowing tablets, use colesevelam hydrochloride for oral suspension. 5.3 Vitamin K or Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies Colesevelam hydrochloride may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Patients with a susceptibility to deficiencies of vitamin K (e.g., patients on warfarin, patients with malabsorption syndromes) or other fat-soluble vitamins may be at increased risk when taking colesevelam hydrochloride. Patients on oral vitamin supplementation should take their vitamins at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.4 Drug Interactions Colesevelam hydrochloride reduces gastrointestinal absorption of some drugs. Administer drugs with a known interaction at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride [see . Drug Interactions (7) ] Due to the potential for decreased absorption of other drugs that have not been tested for interaction, especially those with a narrow therapeutic index, consider administering at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam hydrochloride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypertriglyceridemia and Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Gastrointestinal Obstruction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Vitamin K or Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiencies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] In clinical trials, the most common (incidence \u2265 2% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions with\u00a0colesevelam hydrochloride included constipation, dyspepsia, and nausea ( 6.1 ).

Table 2 Clinical Study of\u00a0Colesevelam Hydrochloride for Primary Hyperlipidemia in HeFH Pediatric Patients: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% of Patients and More Commonly than in Placebo Colesevelam Hydrochloride N = 129 Placebo N = 65 Nasopharyngitis 6.2% 4.6% Headache 3.9% 3.1% Fatigue 3.9% 1.5% Creatine Phosphokinase Increase 2.3% 0% Rhinitis 2.3% 0% Vomiting 2.3% 1.5% The reported adverse reactions during the additional 18-week open-label treatment period with\u00a0colesevelam hydrochloride 3.8 g per day were similar to those during the double-blind period and included headache (7.6%), nasopharyngitis (5.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.9%), influenza (3.8%), and nausea (3.8%). Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In 5 add-on combination and 1 monotherapy double-blind, 12- to 26-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 1022 patients were treated with colesevelam hydrochloride. The mean exposure duration was 20 weeks (total exposure 393 patient-years). Patients were to receive 3.8 grams of colesevelam hydrochloride per day. The mean age of patients was 55.7 years, 52.8 percent of the population was male and 61.9% were Caucasian, 4.8% were Asian, and 15.9% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.2%, and 26% had past medical history suggestive of microvascular complications of diabetes. Table 3 shows adverse reactions associated with the use of colesevelam hydrochloride in patients with type 2 diabetes. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on colesevelam hydrochloride than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with colesevelam hydrochloride. Table 3 Clinical Studies of Colesevelam Hydrochloride for Type 2 Diabetes: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of Patients and More Commonly than in Placebo Colesevelam Hydrochloride N = 1,022 Placebo N = 1,010 Constipation 6.5% 2.2% Hypoglycemia 3.4% 3.1% Dyspepsia 2.8% 1.0% Nausea 2.6% 1.6% Hypertension 2.6% 1.9% Back Pain 2.3% 1.3% A total of 5.3% of colesevelam hydrochloride-treated patients and 3.6% of placebo-treated patients were discontinued from the diabetes trials due to adverse reactions. This difference was driven mostly by gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as abdominal pain and constipation. One patient in the add-on to sulfonylurea trial discontinued due to body rash and mouth blistering that occurred on the first day of dosing of colesevelam hydrochloride, which may represent a hypersensitivity reaction to colesevelam hydrochloride. Hypertriglyceridemia Patients with fasting serum TG levels above 500 mg/dL were excluded from the diabetes clinical trials. In the diabetes trials, 1,292 (67.7%) patients had baseline fasting serum TG levels less than 200 mg/dL, 426 (22.3%) had baseline fasting serum TG levels between 200 and less than 300 mg/dL, 175 (9.2%) had baseline fasting serum TG levels between 300 mg/dL and 500\u00a0mg/dL, and 16 (0.8%) had fasting serum TG levels greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL. The median baseline fasting TG concentration for the study population was 160\u00a0mg/dL; the median post-treatment fasting TG was 180\u00a0mg/dL in the colesevelam hydrochloride group and 162 mg/dL in the placebo group. Colesevelam hydrochloride therapy resulted in a median placebo-corrected increase in serum TG of 9.7% (p = 0.03) in the monotherapy study and of 5% (p = 0.22), 11% (p < 0.001), 18% (p < 0.001), and 22% (p < 0.001), when added to metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylureas, and insulin, respectively. In comparison,\u00a0colesevelam hydrochloride resulted in a median increase in serum TG of 5% compared to placebo (p = 0.42) in a 24-week monotherapy lipid-lowering trial. Fasting TG concentrations \u2265 500 mg/dL occurred in 0.9% of colesevelam hydrochloride-treated patients compared to 0.7% of placebo\u2011treated patients in the diabetes trials. Among these patients, the TG concentrations with colesevelam hydrochloride (median 606 mg/dL; interquartile range 570 mg/dL to 794 mg/dL) were similar to that observed with placebo (median 663 mg/dL; interquartile range 542 mg/dL to 984 mg/dL). Five (0.6%) patients on colesevelam hydrochloride and 3 (0.3%) patients on placebo developed TG elevations > 1,000 mg/dL. Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions During the diabetes trials, the incidence of patients with serious adverse reactions involving the cardiovascular system was 2.2% (22/1,022) in the colesevelam hydrochloride group and 1% (10/1,010) in the placebo group. These overall rates included disparate events (e.g., myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, and bradycardia); therefore, the significance of this imbalance is unknown. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of colesevelam hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse Reactions Resulting from Drug Interactions [see Increased seizure activity or decreased phenytoin levels in patients receiving phenytoin, reduced International Normalized Ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin therapy, and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in patients receiving thyroid hormone replacement therapy Drug Interactions (7) ]: Gastrointestinal : Bowel obstruction (in patients with a history of bowel obstruction or resection), dysphagia or esophageal obstruction (occasionally requiring medical intervention), fecal impaction, pancreatitis, abdominal distension, exacerbation of hemorrhoids, and increased transaminases Laboratory Abnormalities: Hypertriglyceridemia",
