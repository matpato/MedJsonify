    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate capsules are indicated in adults for the : short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer. Most patients heal within four weeks. Some patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy. short-term treatment (4 to 8 weeks) of active benign gastric ulcer. treatment of heartburn and other symptoms associated with GERD for up to 4 weeks. short-term treatment (4 to 8 weeks) of EE due to acid-mediated GERD which has been diagnosed by endoscopy in adults. The efficacy of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate used for longer than 8 weeks in patients with EE has not been established. If a patient does not respond to 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 4 weeks of treatment may be given. If there is recurrence of EE or GERD symptoms (e.g., heartburn), additional 4 to 8-week courses of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate may be considered. maintenance of healing of EE due to acid-mediated GERD. Controlled studies do not extend beyond 12 months. Omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate capsules are indicated in adults for: Treatment of active duodenal ulcer ( 1 ) Treatment of active benign gastric ulcer ( 1 ) Treatment of erosive esophagitis (EE) due to acid-mediated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) ( 1 ) Maintenance of healing of EE ( 1 )",

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy: In adults, symptomatic response does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. ( 5.1 ) Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis: Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients. ( 5.2 ) Sodium Bicarbonate Buffer Content: Take sodium content into consideration in patients on a sodium-restricted diet. Avoid in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance. ( 5.3 ) : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk. ( Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea 5.4 ) Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. ( 5.5 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.6 ) Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate and refer to specialist for evaluation. ( 5.7 ) Interaction with Clopidogrel: Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate. ( 5.8 ) Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.9 ) Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism: Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( 5.10 ) Interaction with St. John's wort or Rifampin: Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate. ( 5.11 , 7 ) Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors: Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) levels may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors; temporarily stop omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels. ( 5.12 ) Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate. ( 5.13 , 7 ) Fundic Gland Polyps : Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea and anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.3 Sodium Bicarbonate Buffer Content Each 20 mg and 40 mg omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate capsule contains 1,100 mg (13 mEq) of sodium bicarbonate. The total content of sodium in each capsule is 304 mg. Chronic administration of bicarbonate with calcium or milk can cause milk-alkali syndrome. Chronic use of sodium bicarbonate may lead to systemic alkalosis, and increased sodium intake can produce edema and weight gain. The sodium content of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate products should be taken into consideration when administering to patients on a sodium-restricted diet or those at risk for developing congestive heart failure. Avoid omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate in patients with Bartter's syndrome, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and problems with acid-base balance. 5.4 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile- associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.5 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to the established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.6 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of PPIs [see Discontinue omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.7 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including omeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.8 Interaction with Clopidogrel Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as omeprazole, that interfere with CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 80 mg omeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel, even when administered 12 hours apart. When using omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate, consider alternative antiplatelet therapy [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.9 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate. 5.10 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI. 5.11 Interaction with St. John's wort or Rifampin Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease omeprazole concentrations [see Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate with St. John's wort or rifampin. Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.12 Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate treatment for at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.13 Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.14 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPIs users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.",

The safety of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate has been established, in part, based on oral studies of an oral delayed-release omeprazole product. Clinical Trials with Omeprazole In the U.S. clinical trial population of 465 adult patients, the adverse reactions summarized in Table 3 were reported to occur in 1% or more of patients on therapy with omeprazole.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Omeprazole Body as a Whole: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm, urticaria (see also below), fever, pain, fatigue, malaise, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Gastroduodenal carcinoids have been reported in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome on long-term treatment with omeprazole. This finding is believed to be a manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with such tumors. Hepatic: Mild and, rarely, marked elevations of liver function tests [ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), \u03b3 -glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin (jaundice)].
