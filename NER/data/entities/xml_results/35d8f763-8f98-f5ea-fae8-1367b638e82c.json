    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Estrogens increase the risk of gall bladder disease ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Discontinue estrogen if severe hypercalcemia, loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs ( 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.9 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy ( 5.11 , 5.18 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Disorders Increased risks of PE, DVT, stroke and MI are reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Increased risks of stroke and DVT are reported with estrogen-alone therapy. Immediately discontinue estrogen with or without progestogen therapy if any of these occur or is suspected. Manage appropriately any risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus). Stroke The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant increased risk of stroke in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 strokes per 10,000 women-years) [see . The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted. Clinical Studies (14.5) ] 1 Immediately discontinue estrogen with or without progestogen therapy if a stroke occurs or is suspected. The WHI estrogen-alone substudy reported a statistically significant increased risk of stroke in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 strokes per 10,000 women-years, respectively). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Immediately discontinue estrogen-alone therapy if a stroke occurs or is suspected. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years). 1 Coronary Heart Disease The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk (not statistically significant) of coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) in those women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years). 1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. The WHI estrogen-alone substudy reported no overall effect on CHD events in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age, who were less than 10 years since menopause, suggest a reduction (not statistically significant) in CHD events in those women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years). 1 In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n=2,763), average 66.7 years of age, in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit. During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD. There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years. Two thousand three hundred twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II. Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall. Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall. Venous Thromboembolism The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE (DVT and PE) in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years). Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated. The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted 3 [see . Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected. Clinical Studies\u00a0(14.5) ] In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years 4 [see . Immediately discontinue estrogen-alone therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected. Clinical Studies (14.5) ] If feasible, discontinue estrogens at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization. 5.2 Malignant Neoplasms Breast Cancer After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA compared to placebo. In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women. The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo. In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group. Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups. Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups 5 [see . Clinical Studies (14.5) ] The WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users. In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] compared to placebo 6 [see . Clinical Studies (14.5) ] Consistent with the WHI clinical trials, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use. One large meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies reported increased risks that were dependent upon duration of use and could last up to >10 years after discontinuation of estrogen plus progestin therapy and estrogen-alone therapy. Extension of the WHI Trials also demonstrated increased breast cancer risk associated with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy. These studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration. The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin therapy has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation. In a one-year trial among 1,176 women who received either unopposed 1 mg estradiol or a combination of 1 mg estradiol plus one of three different doses of NETA (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 mg), seven new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, two of which occurred among the group of 295 women treated with estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets 1 mg/0.5 mg and two of which occurred among the group of 294 women treated with 1 mg estradiol/0.1 mg NETA. All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations. In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results. Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus. The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2- to 12-fold greater than in nonusers, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose. Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year. The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more. This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued. Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important. Perform adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology. There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose. Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia occured at a rate of approximately 1 percent or less with estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets in a clinical trial. Ovarian Cancer The CE plus MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.77-3.24), but it was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years. 7 A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer. The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies. The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis). The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27-1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products. The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown. 5.3 Probable Dementia In the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo. After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for the CE plus MPA versus \u00a0placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI, 1.21-3.48). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus \u00a0placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years 8 [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , and Clinical Studies (14.6) ] In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus\u00a0placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83-2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus \u00a0placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years 8 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , and Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk of probable dementia was 1.76\u00a0 (95 percent CI, 1.19-2.60). Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, \u00a0it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women 8 [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , and Clinical Studies (14.6) ] 5.4 Gallbladder Disease A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported. 5.5 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases. Discontinue estrogens, including estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets if hypercalcemia occurs, and take appropriate measures to reduce the serum calcium level. 5.6 Vision Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Permanently discontinue estrogens, including estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets, if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions. 5.7 Addition of a Progestogen When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestogen for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestogens with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer. 5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen. 5.9 Exacerbation of Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Discontinue estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets if pancreatitis occurs. 5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment. Exercise caution in any woman with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy. In the case of recurrence of cholestatic jaundice, discontinue estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets. 5.11 Exacerbation of Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T 4 and T 3 serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogen may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. Monitor thyroid function in these women during treatment with estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range. 5.12 Fluid Retention Estrogens plus progestogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Monitor any woman with a condition(s) that might predispose her to fluid retention, such as a cardiac or renal impairment. Discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy, including estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets, with evidence of medically concerning fluid retention. 5.13 Hypocalcemia Estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur in women with hypoparathyroidism. Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy, including estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets, outweigh the risks in such women. 5.14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. 5.15 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema. Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy, including estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets, outweigh the risks in such women. 5.16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy, including estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets, may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas. Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy outweigh the risks in such women. 5.17 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy. 5.18 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Accelerated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet aggregation time; increased platelet count; increased factors II, VII antigen, VIII coagulant activity, IX, X, XII, VII-X complex, and beta-thromboglobulin; decreased levels of anti-factor Xa and antithrombin III, decreased antithrombin III activity, increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity; increased plasminogen antigen and activity. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T 4 levels (by column or by radioimmunoassay), or T 3 levels by radioimmunoassay. T 3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG. Free T 4 and free T 3 concentrations are unaltered. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum, for example, corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids, respectively. Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased. Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/rennin substrate, alpha-1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin). Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL 2 cholesterol subfraction concentration, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration, increased triglyceride levels.
