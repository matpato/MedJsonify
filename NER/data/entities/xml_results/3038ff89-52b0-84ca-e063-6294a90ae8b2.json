    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS & USAGE This drug is indicated as an adjunct in the treatment of all forms of parkinsonism (postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic). It is often useful as adjuvant therapy when treating these forms of parkinsonism with levodopa. Additionally, it is indicated for the control of extrapyramidal disorders caused by central nervous system drugs such as the dibenzoxazepines, phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Patients to be treated with trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride should have a gonioscope evaluation and close monitoring of intraocular pressures at regular periodic intervals.PRECAUTIONS GENERAL PRECAUTIONS Although trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride is not contraindicated for patients with cardiac, liver, or kidney disorders, or with hypertension, such patients should be maintained under close observation. Since the use of trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride may, in some cases, continue indefinitely and since it has atropine- like properties, patients should be subjected to constant and careful long-term observation to avoid allergic and other untoward reactions. In as much as trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride possesses some parasympatholytic activity, it should be used with caution in patients with glaucoma, obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts, and in elderly males with possible prostatic hypertrophy. Geriatric patients, particularly over the age of 60, frequently develop increased sensitivity to the actions of drugs of this type, and hence, require strict dosage regulation. Incipient glaucoma may be precipitated by parasympatholytic drugs such as trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride. Tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long term therapy with antipsychotic drugs or may occur after therapy when these drugs have been discontinued. Antiparkinson agents do not alleviate the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia and in some instances may aggravate them. However, parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia often coexist in patients receiving chronic neuroleptic treatment, and anticholinergic therapy with trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride may relieve some of these parkinsonism symptoms.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Minor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurring of vision, dizziness, mild nausea, or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 percent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride than with belladonna alkaloids and are usually less disturbing than unalleviated parkinsonism. Such reactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as treatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted spontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of the dosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated instances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the mouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain psychiatric manifestations such as delusions and hallucinations, plus one doubtful case of paranoia all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, have been rarely reported with trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride. Patients with arteriosclerosis or with a history of idiosyncrasy to other drugs may exhibit reactions of mental confusion, agitation, disturbed behavior, or nausea and vomiting. Such patients should be allowed to develop a tolerance through the initial administration of a small dose and gradual increase in dose until an effective level is reached. If a severe reaction should occur, administration of the drug should be discontinued for a few days and then resumed at a lower dosage. Psychiatric disturbances can result from indiscriminate use (leading to overdosage) to sustain continued euphoria. Potential side effects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs include constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or retention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular tension, weakness, vomiting, and headache. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma due to long-term treatment with trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride has been reported.
