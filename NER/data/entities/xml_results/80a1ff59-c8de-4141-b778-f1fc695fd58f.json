    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Testosterone topical gel is indicated for replacement therapy in males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone: Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) \u2013 testicular failure due to conditions such as cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome, orchiectomy, Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome, chemotherapy, or toxic damage from alcohol, heavy metals. These men usually have low serum testosterone concentrations and gonadotropins (follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) above the normal range. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired) \u2013 gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) deficiency or pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation. These men have low serum testosterone concentrations but have gonadotropins in the normal or low range. Limitations of Use Safety and efficacy of testosterone topical gel in men with \u201cage-related hypogonadism\u201d (also referred to as \u201clate-onset hypogonadism\u201d) have not been established.

Testosterone gel is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. Testosterone can cause virilization of the female fetus when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.2 )] Men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected prostate cancer. ( 4 , 5.1 ) Women who are pregnant. Testosterone may cause fetal harm. ( 4 , 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.2 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. ( 5.1 ) Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to testosterone gel. Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization. Testosterone gel should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified. ( 5.2 ) Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients using testosterone products. Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE. ( 5.4 ) Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy. ( 5.5 ) Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia. ( 5.8 ) Edema with or without congestive heart failure (CHF) may be a complication in patients with pre-existing cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease. ( 5.10 ) Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors. ( 5.12 ) Monitor serum testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), hemoglobin, hematocrit, liver function tests and lipid concentrations periodically. ( 5.1, 5.3, 5.9, 5.13 ) Testosterone gel is flammable until dry. ( 5.16 ) 5.1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk of worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH. Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms. Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer. Evaluation of the patients for the presence of prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens is appropriate [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases, these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age-appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product. Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using\u00a0testosterone gel [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children, or changes in body hair distribution, significant increase in acne, or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician. Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified. 5.3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit, reflective of increases in red blood cell mass, may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone. Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment. It would also be appropriate to re-evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment, and then annually. If hematocrit becomes elevated, stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration. An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events. 5.4\u00a0Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone gel. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone gel and initiate appropriate workup and management. 5.5 Cardiovascular Risk Long-term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men. To date, epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), such as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death, with the use of testosterone compared to non-use. Some studies, but not all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel. 5.6 Abuse of Testosterone and Monitoring\nof Serum Testosterone \nConcentrations \u200b Testosterone has been subject to abuse, typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions [see Drug Abuse and Dependence . (9) ] If testosterone abuse is suspected, check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range. However, testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives. Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids. Conversely, consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events. 5.7 Use in Women Due to the lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects, testosterone gel is not indicated for use in women [ . see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)] 5.8 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens, including testosterone gel, spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary FSH which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count. 5.9 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17-alpha-alkyl androgens (e.g. methyltestosterone) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects (peliosis hepatis, hepatic neoplasms, cholestatic hepatitis, and jaundice). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication. Long-term therapy with testosterone enanthate has produced multiple hepatic adenomas.\u00a0Testosterone gel  is not known to cause these adverse effects. 5.10 Edema Androgens, including testosterone gel, may promote retention of sodium and water. Edema, with or without congestive heart failure, may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.11 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia may develop and persist in patients being treated with androgens, including testosterone gel, for hypogonadism. 5.12 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients, especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases. 5.13 Lipids Changes in serum lipid profile may require dose adjustment or discontinuation of testosterone therapy. 5.14 Hypercalcemia Androgens, including testosterone gel, should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia (and associated hypercalciuria). Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients. 5.15 Decreased Thyroxine-binding Globulin Androgens, including testosterone gel, may decrease concentrations of thyroxin-binding globulins, resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4. Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. 5.16 Flammability Alcohol based products, including testosterone gel, are flammable; therefore, patients should be advised to avoid smoking, fire, or flame until the testosterone gel has dried.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction (incidence\u00a0greater than or equal to\u00a03%) is skin reactions at the application site (16.1%). ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In a controlled multicenter, open-label, non-comparative 90-day clinical study, 149 hypogonadal patients were treated with\u00a0testosterone gel [ . Adverse reactions occurred in 22.8% (34/149) of patients. The most common adverse reaction reported in this study was skin reactions associated with the site of application (16.1%; 24/149) of which 79% (19/24) were mild and the remainder were moderate (21%; 5/24) (Table 3). see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Table 3: Adverse Reactions Reported in >1% of Patients in the US Phase 3 Clinical Trial of  Testosterone Gel Adverse Reaction Number (%) of Patients N = 149 Skin reaction 24 (16.1%) Prostatic specific antigen increased 2 (1.3%) Abnormal dreams 2 (1.3%) During the 90-day trial 5 patients (3.4%) discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions. These reactions were: 1 patient with contact dermatitis (considered probably related to testosterone gel application), 1 with application site reaction (considered probably related to testosterone gel application), 1 with gastrointestinal hypomotility (considered possibly related to testosterone gel application), 1 with severe dyspnea (considered not related to testosterone gel application), and 1 with moderate contusion (considered not related to testosterone gel application). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of testosterone gel. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure (Table 4). Table 4: Adverse Drug Reactions from Post Approval Experience of Testosterone Gel by System Organ Class System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Blood and lymphatic system disorders Polycythemia Eye disorders Vitreous detachment Gastrointestinal disorders Abdominal symptoms General disorders and administrative site conditions Application site erythema, irritation, pruritus, and swelling; fatigue, influenza like illness, and malaise Investigations Decreased serum testosterone, increased hematocrit and hemoglobin Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Pain in extremity Nervous system disorders Dizziness, headache, and migraine Reproductive system and breast disorders Erectile dysfunction and priapism Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Allergic dermatitis, erythema, rash, and papular rash Vascular disorders Venous thromboembolism Cardiovascular disorders Myocardial infarction and stroke Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products. Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris (with surgical intervention) or the penis, development of pubic hair, increased erections and libido, aggressive behavior, and advanced bone age. In most cases with a reported outcome, these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure. In a few cases, however, enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age appropriate normal size, and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age. In some of the cases, direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported. In at least 1 reported case, the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user\u2019s shirts and/or other fabric, such as towels and sheets [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )]",
