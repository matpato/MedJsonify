    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Advise patients about the possibility of symptoms related to postural hypotension and to avoid situations where injury could result should syncope occur ( 5.1 ) Should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Use with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, or in combination with other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. ( 5.2 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) Should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents ( 5.2 , 7.2 , 12.3 ) Exercise caution with concomitant administration of warfarin ( 5.2 , 7.4 , 12.3 ) Advise patients about the possibility and seriousness of priapism ( 5.3 ) Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients. Advise patients considering cataract or glaucoma surgery to tell their ophthalmologist that they have taken tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. ( 5.5 ) Advise patients to be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment and at regular intervals afterwards ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Orthostasis The signs and symptoms of orthostasis (postural hypotension, dizziness, and vertigo) were detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients. As with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents there is a potential risk of syncope [see Adverse Reactions ( . Patients beginning treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be cautioned to avoid situations in which injury could result should syncope occur. 6.1 )] 5.2 Drug Interactions Tamsulosin is extensively metabolized, mainly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg should not be used in combination with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) [see Drug Interactions ( . Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin), in combination with strong (e.g., paroxetine) or moderate (e.g., terbinafine) inhibitors of CYP2D6, in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should be used with caution in combination with cimetidine, particularly at a dose higher than 0.4 mg (e.g., 0.8 mg) [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] Tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules should not be used in combination with other alpha adrenergic blocking agents [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Caution is advised when alpha adrenergic blocking agents including tamsulosin hydrochloride are coadministered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alpha-adrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of warfarin and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.3 Priapism Rarely (probably less than 1 in 50,000 patients), tamsulosin, like other alpha 1 antagonists, has been associated with priapism (persistent painful penile erection unrelated to sexual activity). Because this condition can lead to permanent impotence if not properly treated, patients must be advised about the seriousness of the condition. 5.4 Screening for Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer and BPH frequently coexist; therefore, patients should be screened for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and at regular intervals afterwards. 5.5 Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract and glaucoma surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha 1 blockers, including tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] Most reports were in patients taking the alpha 1 blocker when IFIS occurred, but in some cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped prior to surgery. In most of these cases, the alpha 1 blocker had been stopped recently prior to surgery (2 to 14 days), but in a few cases, IFIS was reported after the patient had been off the alpha1\u00a0blocker for a longer period (5 weeks to 9 months). IFIS is a variant of small pupil syndrome and is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient\u2019s ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. The benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract or glaucoma surgery has not been established. The initiation of therapy with tamsulosin in patients for whom cataract or glaucoma surgery is scheduled is not recommended. 5.6 Sulfa Allergy In patients with sulfa allergy, allergic reaction to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules has been rarely reported. If a patient reports a serious or life-threatening sulfa allergy, caution is warranted when administering tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules.",

The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events has been ascertained from six short-term U.S. and European placebo-controlled clinical trials in which daily doses of 0.1 to 0.8 mg tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules were used. These studies evaluated safety in 1783 patients treated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules and 798 patients administered placebo.

Syncope was reported by 0.2% of patients (1 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 0.4% of patients (2 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Dizziness was reported by 15% of patients (75 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 17% of patients (84 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and 10% of patients (50 of 493) in the placebo group. Vertigo was reported by 0.6% of patients (3 of 502) in the 0.4 mg group, 1% of patients (5 of 492) in the 0.8 mg group, and by 0.6% of patients (3 of 493) in the placebo group. Multiple testing for orthostatic hypotension was conducted in a number of studies. Such a test was considered positive if it met one or more of the following criteria: (1) a decrease in systolic blood pressure of \u226520 mmHg upon standing from the supine position during the orthostatic tests; (2) a decrease in diastolic blood pressure \u226510 mmHg upon standing, with the standing diastolic blood pressure <65 mmHg during the orthostatic test; (3) an increase in pulse rate of \u226520 bpm upon standing with a standing pulse rate \u2265100 bpm during the orthostatic test; and (4) the presence of clinical symptoms (faintness, lightheadedness/lightheaded, dizziness, spinning sensation, vertigo, or postural hypotension) upon standing during the orthostatic test. Following the first dose of double-blind medication in Study 1, a positive orthostatic test result at 4 hours post dose was observed in 7% of patients (37 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and in 3% of the patients (8 of 253) who received placebo. At 8 hours post dose, a positive orthostatic test result was observed for 6% of the patients (31 of 498) who received tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once daily and 4% (9 of 250) who received placebo (Note: patients in the 0.8 mg group received 0.4 mg once daily for the first week of Study 1). In Studies 1 and 2, at least one positive orthostatic test result was observed during the course of these studies for 81 of the 502 patients (16%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.4 mg once-daily group, 92 of the 491 patients (19%) in the tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules 0.8 mg once-daily group, and 54 of the 493 patients (11%) in the placebo group. Because orthostasis was detected more frequently in tamsulosin hydrochloride capsule-treated patients than in placebo recipients, there is a potential risk of syncope [see\u00a0\u00a0Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]\u00a0. Abnormal Ejaculation Abnormal ejaculation includes ejaculation failure, ejaculation disorder, retrograde ejaculation, and ejaculation decrease. As shown in Table 1, abnormal ejaculation was associated with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules administration and was dose-related in the U.S. studies. Withdrawal from these clinical studies of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules because of abnormal ejaculation was also dose-dependent, with 8 of 492 patients (1.6%) in the 0.8 mg group and no patients in the 0.4 mg or placebo groups discontinuing treatment due to abnormal ejaculation. Laboratory Tests No laboratory test interactions with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules are known. Treatment with tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules for up to 12 months had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the reaction, (2) frequency of reporting, or (3) strength of causal connection to tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules. Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms have been reported with positive rechallenge in some cases. Priapism has been reported rarely. Infrequent reports of dyspnea, palpitations, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, arrhythmia, tachycardia, skin desquamation including reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, dermatitis exfoliative, constipation, vomiting, dry mouth, visual impairment, and epistaxis have been received during the postmarketing period. During cataract and glaucoma surgery, a variant of small pupil syndrome known as Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been reported in association with alpha 1 blocker therapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.5 )]",
