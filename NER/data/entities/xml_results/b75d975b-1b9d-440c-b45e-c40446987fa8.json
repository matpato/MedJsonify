    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Rocuronium Bromide is contraindicated in patients known to have hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to rocuronium bromide or other neuromuscular blocking agents [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis) to Rocuronium Bromide or other neuromuscular blocking agents. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Appropriate Administration and Monitoring: Use only if facilities for intubation, mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, and an antagonist are immediately available. ( 5.1 ) Anaphylaxis: Severe anaphylaxis has been reported. Consider cross-reactivity among neuromuscular blocking agents. ( 5.2 ) Risk of Death due to Medication Errors: Accidental administration can cause death. ( 5.3 ) Need for Adequate Anesthesia: Must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation. ( 5.4 ) Residual Paralysis: Consider using a reversal agent in cases where residual paralysis is more likely to occur. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Appropriate Administration and Monitoring Rocuronium Bromide should be administered in carefully adjusted dosages by or under the supervision of experienced clinicians who are familiar with the drug's actions and the possible complications of its use. The drug should not be administered unless facilities for intubation, mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, and an antagonist are immediately available. It is recommended that clinicians administering neuromuscular blocking agents such as Rocuronium Bromide employ a peripheral nerve stimulator to monitor drug effect, need for additional doses, adequacy of spontaneous recovery or antagonism, and to decrease the complications of overdosage if additional doses are administered. 5.2 Anaphylaxis Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including Rocuronium Bromide, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases (including cases with Rocuronium Bromide), been life threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those patients who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents, since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non depolarizing, has been reported. 5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors Administration of Rocuronium Bromide Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in the critical care and other clinical settings.\u00a0 If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the dose is clearly communicated. 5.4 Need for Adequate Anesthesia Rocuronium Bromide has no known effect on consciousness, pain threshold, or cerebration. Therefore, its administration must be accompanied by adequate anesthesia or sedation. 5.5 Residual Paralysis In order to prevent complications resulting from residual paralysis, it is recommended to extubate only after the patient has recovered sufficiently from neuromuscular block. Geriatric patients (65 years or older) may be at increased risk for residual neuromuscular block. Other factors which could cause residual paralysis after extubation in the post-operative phase (such as drug interactions or patient condition) should also be considered. If not used as part of standard clinical practice the use of a reversal agent should be considered, especially in those cases where residual paralysis is more likely to occur. 5.6 Long-Term Use in an Intensive Care Unit Rocuronium Bromide has not been studied for long-term use in the intensive care unit (ICU). As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, apparent tolerance to Rocuronium Bromide may develop during chronic administration in the ICU. While the mechanism for development of this resistance is not known, receptor up-regulation may be a contributing factor. It is strongly recommended that neuromuscular transmission be monitored continuously during administration and recovery with the help of a nerve stimulator. Additional doses of Rocuronium Bromide or any other neuromuscular blocking agent should not be given until there is a definite response (one twitch of the train-of-four) to nerve stimulation. Prolonged paralysis and/or skeletal muscle weakness may be noted during initial attempts to wean from the ventilator patients who have chronically received neuromuscular blocking drugs in the ICU. Myopathy after long-term administration of other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents in the ICU alone or in combination with corticosteroid therapy has been reported. Therefore, for patients receiving both neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids, the period of use of the neuromuscular blocking agent should be limited as much as possible and only used in the setting where in the opinion of the prescribing physician, the specific advantages of the drug outweigh the risk. 5.7 Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) Rocuronium Bromide has not been studied in MH-susceptible patients. Because Rocuronium Bromide is always used with other agents, and the occurrence of malignant hyperthermia during anesthesia is possible even in the absence of known triggering agents, clinicians should be familiar with early signs, confirmatory diagnosis, and treatment of malignant hyperthermia prior to the start of any anesthetic. In an animal study in MH-susceptible swine, the administration of Rocuronium Bromide Injection did not appear to trigger malignant hyperthermia. 5.8 Prolonged Circulation Time Conditions associated with an increased circulatory delayed time, e.g., cardiovascular disease or advanced age, may be associated with a delay in onset time [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.9 QT Interval Prolongation The overall analysis of ECG data in pediatric patients indicates that the concomitant use of Rocuronium Bromide with general anesthetic agents can prolong the QTc interval [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.3 )] 5.10 Conditions/Drugs Causing Potentiation of, or Resistance to, Neuromuscular Block Potentiation Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents have been found to exhibit profound neuromuscular blocking effects in cachectic or debilitated patients, patients with neuromuscular diseases, and patients with carcinomatosis. Certain inhalation anesthetics, particularly enflurane and isoflurane, antibiotics, magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine have been shown to increase the duration of neuromuscular block and decrease infusion requirements of neuromuscular blocking agents [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.3 )] In these or other patients in whom potentiation of neuromuscular block or difficulty with reversal may be anticipated, a decrease from the recommended initial dose of Rocuronium Bromide should be considered [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] Resistance Resistance to nondepolarizing agents, consistent with up-regulation of skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptors, is associated with burns, disuse atrophy, denervation, and direct muscle trauma. Receptor up-regulation may also contribute to the resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants which sometimes develops in patients with cerebral palsy, patients chronically receiving anticonvulsant agents such as carbamazepine or phenytoin, or with chronic exposure to nondepolarizing agents. When Rocuronium Bromide is administered to these patients, shorter durations of neuromuscular block may occur, and infusion rates may be higher due to the development of resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Potentiation or Resistance Severe acid-base and/or electrolyte abnormalities may potentiate or cause resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of Rocuronium Bromide. No data are available in such patients and no dosing recommendations can be made. Rocuronium Bromide-induced neuromuscular blockade was modified by alkalosis and acidosis in experimental pigs. Both respiratory and metabolic acidosis prolonged the recovery time. The potency of Rocuronium Bromide was significantly enhanced in metabolic acidosis and alkalosis, but was reduced in respiratory alkalosis. In addition, experience with other drugs has suggested that acute (e.g., diarrhea) or chronic (e.g., adrenocortical insufficiency) electrolyte imbalance may alter neuromuscular blockade. Since electrolyte imbalance and acid-base imbalance are usually mixed, either enhancement or inhibition may occur. 5.11 Incompatibility with Alkaline Solutions Rocuronium Bromide, which has an acid pH, should not be mixed with alkaline solutions (e.g., barbiturate solutions) in the same syringe or administered simultaneously during intravenous infusion through the same needle. 5.12 Increase in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Rocuronium Bromide may be associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, so caution is appropriate in patients with pulmonary hypertension or valvular heart disease [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.1 )] 5.13 Use in Patients with Myasthenia In patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic (Eaton-Lambert) syndrome, small doses of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents may have profound effects. In such patients, a peripheral nerve stimulator and use of a small test dose may be of value in monitoring the response to administration of muscle relaxants. 5.14 Extravasation If extravasation occurs, it may be associated with signs or symptoms of local irritation. The injection or infusion should be terminated immediately and restarted in another vein.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (2%) are transient hypotension and hypertension. The following adverse reactions are described, or described in greater detail, in other sections: Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Residual paralysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Increased pulmonary vascular resistance [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Most common adverse reactions (2%) are transient hypotension and hypertension.

Clinical studies in the US (n=1137) and Europe (n=1394) totaled 2531 patients. The patients exposed in the US clinical studies provide the basis for calculation of adverse reaction rates. The following adverse reactions were reported in patients administered Rocuronium Bromide (all events judged by investigators during the clinical trials to have a possible causal relationship): Adverse reactions in greater than 1% of patients: None Adverse reactions in less than 1% of patients (probably related or relationship unknown): Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, abnormal electrocardiogram, tachycardia Digestive: nausea, vomiting Respiratory: asthma (bronchospasm, wheezing, or rhonchi), hiccup Skin and Appendages: rash, injection site edema, pruritus In the European studies, the most commonly reported reactions were transient hypotension (2%) and hypertension (2%); these are in greater frequency than the US studies (0.1% and 0.1%). Changes in heart rate and blood pressure were defined differently from in the US studies in which changes in cardiovascular parameters were not considered as adverse events unless judged by the investigator as unexpected, clinically significant, or thought to be histamine related. In a clinical study in patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension and tachycardia were reported in some patients, but these occurrences were less frequent in patients receiving beta or calcium channel-blocking drugs. In some patients, Rocuronium Bromide was associated with transient increases (30% or greater) in pulmonary vascular resistance. In another clinical study of patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, transient increases (30% or greater) in pulmonary vascular resistance were observed in about 24% of patients receiving Rocuronium Bromide 0.6 or 0.9 mg/kg. In pediatric patient studies worldwide (n=704), tachycardia occurred at an incidence of 5.3% (n=37), and it was judged by the investigator as related in 10 cases (1.4%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In clinical practice, there have been reports of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions and shock) with Rocuronium Bromide, including some that have been life-threatening and fatal [ see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency.
