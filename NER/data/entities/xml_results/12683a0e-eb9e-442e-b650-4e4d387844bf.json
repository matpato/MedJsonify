    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Serious hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions have been reported in patients receiving piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. Discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam for injection if a reaction occurs. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam for injection for progressive rashes. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has been reported with the use of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. If HLH is suspected, discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam for injection immediately. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Rhabdomyolysis: If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are observed,discontinue Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and initiateappropriate therapy. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hematological effects (including bleeding, leukopenia and neutropenia) have occurred. Monitor hematologic tests during prolonged therapy. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 As with other penicillins, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially in the presence of renal impairment may be at greater risk. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Nephrotoxicity in critically ill patients has been observed; the use of Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients. Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea: evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Adverse Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic/anaphylactoid) reactions (including shock) have been reported in patients receiving therapy with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin, cephalosporin, or carbapenem hypersensitivity or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Before initiating therapy with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions. If an allergic reaction occurs, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.2 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection may cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely and piperacillin and tazobactam for injection discontinued if lesions progress. 5.3 Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in pediatric and adult patients treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia. If HLH is suspected, discontinue piperacillin and tazobactam for injection immediately and institute appropriate management. 5.4 Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis has been reported with the use of Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. If signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis such as muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, dark urine, or elevated creatine phosphokinase are observed, discontinue Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection and initiate appropriate therapy. 5.5 Hematologic Adverse Reactions Bleeding manifestations have occurred in some patients receiving beta-lactam drugs, including piperacillin. These reactions have sometimes been associated with abnormalities of coagulation tests such as clotting time, platelet aggregation and prothrombin time, and are more likely to occur in patients with renal failure. If bleeding manifestations occur, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. The leukopenia/neutropenia associated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection administration appears to be reversible and most frequently associated with prolonged administration. Periodic assessment of hematopoietic function should be performed, especially with prolonged therapy, i.e., \u2265 21 days [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.6 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions As with other penicillins, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection may cause neuromuscular excitability or seizures. Patients receiving higher doses, especially patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk for central nervous system adverse reactions. Closely monitor patients with renal impairment or seizure disorders for signs and symptoms of neuromuscular excitability or seizures [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6.2 ) 5.7 Nephrotoxicity in Critically ill Patients The use of Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection was found to be an independent risk factor for renal failure and was associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs in a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in critically ill patients [see Adverse Reactions ( . Based on this study, alternative treatment options should be considered in the critically ill population. If alternative treatment options are inadequate or unavailable, monitor renal function during treatment with Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection 6.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Combined use of piperacillin and tazobactam and vancomycin may be associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. 5.8 Electrolyte Effects Piperacillin and tazobactam for injection contains a total of 2.35 mEq (54 mg) of Na+ (sodium) per gram of piperacillin in the combination product. This should be considered when treating patients requiring restricted salt intake. Periodic electrolyte determinations should be performed in patients with low potassium reserves, and the possibility of hypokalemia should be kept in mind with patients who have potentially low potassium reserves and who are receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics. 5.9 Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including piperacillin and tazobactam for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.10 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of development of drug-resistant bacteria.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are diarrhea, constipation, nausea, headache, and insomnia.

Clinical Trials in Adult Patients During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n=830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%). Table 6: Adverse Reactions from Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection Monotherapy Clinical Trials System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Gastrointestinal disorders Diarrhea (11.3%) Constipation (7.7%) Nausea (6.9%) Vomiting (3.3%) Dyspepsia (3.3%) Abdominal pain (1.3%) General disorders and administration site conditions Fever (2.4%) Injection site reaction (\u22641%) Rigors (\u22641%) Immune system disorders Anaphylaxis (\u22641%) Infections and infestations Candidiasis (1.6%) Pseudomembranous colitis (\u22641%) Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hypoglycemia (\u22641%) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Myalgia (\u22641%) Arthralgia (\u22641%) Nervous system disorders Headache (7.7%) Psychiatric disorders Insomnia (6.6%) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash (4.2%, including maculopapular, bullous, and urticarial) Pruritus (3.1%) Purpura (\u22641%) Vascular disorders Phlebitis (1.3%) Thrombophlebitis (\u22641%) Hypotension (\u22641%) Flushing (\u22641%) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Epistaxis (\u22641%) Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg every 6 hours) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11%) patients in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p >0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The second trial used a dosing regimen of 3.375 g given every 4 hours with an aminoglycoside. Table 7: Adverse Reactions from Piperacillin and Tazobactam Injection plus Aminoglycoside Clinical Trials* System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Blood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocythemia (1.4%) Anemia (\u22641%) Thrombocytopenia (\u22641%) Eosinophilia (\u22641%) Gastrointestinal disorders Diarrhea (20%) Constipation (8.4%) Nausea (5.8%) Vomiting (2.7%) Dyspepsia (1.9%) Abdominal pain (1.8%) Stomatitis (\u22641%) General disorders and administration site conditions Fever (3.2%) Injection site reaction (\u22641%) Infections and infestations Oral candidiasis (3.9%) Candidiasis (1.8%) Investigations BUN increased (1.8%) Blood creatinine increased (1.8%) Liver function test abnormal (1.4%) Alkaline phosphatase increased (\u22641%) Aspartate aminotransferase increased (\u22641%) Alanine aminotransferase increased (\u22641%) Metabolism and nutrition disorders Hypoglycemia (\u22641%) Hypokalemia (\u22641%) Nervous system disorders Headache (4.5%) Psychiatric disorders Insomnia (4.5%) Renal and urinary disorders Renal failure (\u22641%) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash (3.9%) Pruritus (3.2%) Vascular disorders Thrombophlebitis (1.3%) Hypotension (1.3%) * For adverse drug reactions that appeared in both studies the higher frequency is presented. Other Trials: Nephrotoxicity In a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial in 1200 adult critically ill patients, piperacillin and tazobactam was found to be a risk factor for renal failure (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.43), and associated with delayed recovery of renal function as compared to other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. 1 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Adverse Laboratory Changes (Seen During Clinical Trials) Of the trials reported, including that of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections in which a higher dose of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection was used in combination with an aminoglycoside, changes in laboratory parameters include: Hematologic \u2013decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, increases in platelet count, eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropenia. These patients were withdrawn from therapy; some had accompanying systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, rigors, chills) Coagulation \u2013positive direct Coombs\u2019 test, prolonged prothrombin time, prolonged partial thromboplastin time Hepatic \u2013transient elevations of AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin Renal \u2013increases in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen Additional laboratory events include abnormalities in electrolytes (i.e., increases and decreases in sodium, potassium, and calcium), hyperglycemia, decreases in total protein or albumin, blood glucose decreased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, hypokalemia, and bleeding time prolonged. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients Clinical studies of piperacillin and tazobactam in pediatric patients suggest a similar safety profile to that seen in adults. In a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial of pediatric patients, 2 to 12 years of age, with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis and/or peritonitis), 273 patients were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam 112.5 mg/kg given IV every 8 hours and 269 patients were treated with cefotaxime (50 mg/kg) plus metronidazole (7.5 mg/kg) every 8 hours. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 146 patients, 73 (26.7%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 73 (27.1%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group. Six patients (2.2%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 5 patients (1.9%) in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group discontinued due to an adverse event. In a retrospective, cohort study, 140 pediatric patients 2 months to less than 18 years of age with nosocomial pneumonia were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam and 267 patients were treated with comparators (which included ticarcillin-clavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin). The rates of serious adverse reactions were generally similar between the piperacillin and tazobactam and comparator groups, including patients aged 2 months to 9 months treated with piperacillin and tazobactam 90 mg/kg IV every 6 hours and patients older than 9 months and less than 18 years of age treated with piperacillin and tazobactam 112.5 mg/kg IV every 6 hours. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to the adverse drug reactions identified in clinical trials in Table 6 and Table 7 , the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary - hepatitis, jaundice Hematologic - hemolytic anemia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia Immune - hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction may occur as part of an allergic reaction. Renal - interstitial nephritis Nervous system disorders - seizures Psychiatric disorders - delirium Respiratory - eosinophilic pneumonia Skin and Appendages - erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), dermatitis exfoliative, and linear IgA bullous dermatosis. Musculoskeletal - rhabdomyolysis Post-marketing experience with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in pediatric patients suggests a similar safety profile to that seen in adults. 6.3 Additional Experience with Piperacillin The following adverse reaction has also been reported for piperacillin for injection: Skeletal \u2013prolonged neuromuscular blockade [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.5 )]",
