( 5.2 ) 5.1   Urinary Retention Urinary retention has been reported in patients taking GEMTESA. The risk of urinary retention may be increased in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and also in patients taking muscarinic antagonist medications for the treatment of OAB.  Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of urinary retention, particularly in patients with bladder outlet obstruction or patients taking muscarinic antagonist medications for the treatment of OAB. Discontinue GEMTESA in patients who develop urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.2   Angioedema Angioedema of the face and/or larynx has been reported with GEMTESA. Angioedema has been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema, associated with upper airway swelling, may be life-threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, immediately discontinue GEMTESA and provide appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway.

Overactive Bladder in Adults The safety of GEMTESA was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study (Study 3003) in patients with OAB [see Clinical Studies ( . A total of 545 patients received GEMTESA. The majority of the patients were White (78%) and female (85%) with a mean age of 60 years (range 18 to 93 years). 14.1 )] Adverse reactions that were reported in Study 3003 at an incidence greater than placebo and in \u22652% of patients treated with GEMTESA are listed in Table 1 .

Of the 273 patients who received GEMTESA 75 mg once daily in the extension study, 181 patients were treated for a total of one year. Adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients treated with GEMTESA 75 mg for up to 52 weeks in the long-term extension study, and not already listed above, were urinary tract infection (6.6%) and bronchitis (2.9%). Overactive Bladder in Adult Males with BPH The safety of GEMTESA was evaluated in a 24-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Study 3005) in male patients with OAB on pharmacological therapy for BPH. A total of 553 patients received GEMTESA [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.2 )] Adverse reactions that were reported in Study 3005 at an incidence greater than placebo and in \u22652% of patients treated with GEMTESA are listed in Table 2 .

Of the 276 patients who received GEMTESA 75 mg once daily in the extension study, 124 patients were treated for a total of one year. There were no additional adverse reactions reported in Study 3006 that are not already included in Section 6.1 above. 6.2   Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of vibegron. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse events have been reported in association with vibegron use in worldwide postmarketing experience: Urologic disorders : urinary retention Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : angioedema of the face and larynx; hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, pruritus, rash and drug eruption; eczema Gastrointestinal disorders : constipation",
