Patients should be observed closely at initiation of treatment and after dose increases ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstructions ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Anesthesia Donepezil hydrochloride, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. 5.2 Cardiovascular Conditions Because of their pharmacological action, cholinesterase inhibitors may have vagotonic effects on the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. This effect may manifest as bradycardia or heart block in patients both with and without known underlying cardiac conduction abnormalities. Syncopal episodes have been reported in association with the use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets. 5.3 Nausea and Vomiting Donepezil hydrochloride tablets, as a predictable consequence of their pharmacological properties, have been shown to produce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. These effects, when they occur, appear more frequently with the 10 mg/day dose than with the 5 mg/day dose. Although in most cases, these effects have been transient, sometimes lasting one to three weeks, and have resolved during continued use of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be observed closely at the initiation of treatment and after dose increases. 5.4 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding Through their primary action, cholinesterase inhibitors may be expected to increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity. Therefore, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets in a dose of 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day have shown no increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. 5.6 Genitourinary Conditions Although not observed in clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets, cholinomimetics may cause bladder outflow obstruction. 5.7 Neurological Conditions: Seizures Cholinomimetics are believed to have some potential to cause generalized convulsions. However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. 5.8 Pulmonary Conditions Because of their cholinomimetic actions, cholinesterase inhibitors should be prescribed with care to patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in clinical studies of donepezil hydrochloride tablets are nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramps, fatigue, and anorexia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Torrent Pharma Inc. at 1-800-912-9561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or www.fda.gov/medwatch. The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Cardiovascular Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Nausea and Vomiting [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Peptic Ulcer Disease and GI Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Genitourinary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Neurological Conditions: Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] \u2022 Pulmonary Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Donepezil hydrochloride tablets have been administered to over 1,700 individuals during clinical trials worldwide. Approximately 1,200 of these patients have been treated for at least 3 months and more than 1,000 patients have been treated for at least 6 months. Controlled and uncontrolled trials in the United States included approximately 900 patients. In regards to the highest dose of 10 mg/day, this population includes 650 patients treated for 3 months, 475 patients treated for 6 months, and 116 patients treated for over 1 year. The range of patient exposure is from 1 to 1,214 days Mild to Moderate Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg/day treatment groups were comparable to those of placebo treatment groups at approximately 5%. The rate of discontinuation of patients who received 7-day escalations from 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day was higher at 13%. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo patients, are shown in Table 1.

These include nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, vomiting, muscle cramp, fatigue and anorexia. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. There is evidence to suggest that the frequency of these common adverse reactions may be affected by the rate of titration. An open-label study was conducted with 269 patients who received placebo in the 15- and 30-week studies. These patients were titrated to a dose of 10 mg/day over a 6-week period. The rates of common adverse reactions were lower than those seen in patients titrated to 10 mg/day over one week in the controlled clinical trials and were comparable to those seen in patients on 5 mg/day. See Table 2 for a comparison of the most common adverse reactions following one and six week titration regimens.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation The rates of discontinuation from controlled clinical trials of donepezil hydrochloride tablets due to adverse reactions for the donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients were approximately 12% compared to 7% for placebo patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation, defined as those occurring in at least 2% of donepezil hydrochloride tablets patients and at twice or more the incidence seen in placebo, were anorexia (2% vs. 1% placebo), nausea (2% vs. <1% placebo), diarrhea (2% vs. 0% placebo) and urinary tract infection (2% vs. 1% placebo). Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions, defined as those occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in patients receiving donepezil hydrochloride tablets and at twice or more the placebo rate, are largely predicted by donepezil hydrochloride tablet's cholinomimetic effects. These include diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, and ecchymosis. These adverse reactions were often transient, resolving during continued donepezil hydrochloride tablets treatment without the need for dose modification. Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of patients in pooled placebo-controlled trials who received donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg and 10 mg and for which the rate of occurrence was greater for patients treated with donepezil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo.
