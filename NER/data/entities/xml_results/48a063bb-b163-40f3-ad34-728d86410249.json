    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gastric Malignancy : In adults, symptomatic response does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing. ( ) 5.1 Acute\u00a0Tubulointerstitial Nephritis : Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients. ( ) 5.2 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk. ( ) 5.3 Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( ) 5.4 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions : Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( ) 5.5 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus : Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension and refer to specialist for evaluation. ( 5.6 ) I n teraction with Clopidogrel : Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension ( ) 5.7 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency : Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( ) 5.8 H y p o m agne semia and Mineral Metabolism : Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( ) 5.9 I n teraction with St. John's Wort or Rifampin : Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension. ( , 5.10 ) 7 I n teractions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors : Increased chromogranin A (CgA) levels may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors, temporarily stop esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels. ( , 5.1 1 ) 12.2 I n teraction with Methotrexate : Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high dose methotrexate administration, consider temporary withdrawal of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension. ( , 5.12 ) 7 Fundic Gland Polyps : Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. ( ) 5.13 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Acute\u00a0Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to non-specific symptoms of decreased renal function (e.g., malaise, nausea, anorexia). In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations (e.g., fever, rash or arthralgia). Discontinue esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.3 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension may be associated with an increased risk of C lostridium difficile- associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents (clarithromycin and amoxicillin) indicated for use in combination with esomeprazole magnesium, refer to Warnings and Precautions section of the corresponding prescribing information. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer). Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see . Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported in association with the use of PPIs [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Discontinue esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including esomeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.7 Interaction with Clopidogrel Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as esomeprazole, that inhibit CYP2C19 activity. Concomitant use of clopidogrel with 40 mg esomeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel. When using esomeprazole magnesium consider alternative anti-platelet therapy [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.8 Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 5.9 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI. 5.10 Interaction with St. John\u2019s Wort or Rifampin Drugs which induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease esomeprazole concentrations [see . Avoid concomitant use of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension with St. John's Wort or rifampin. Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.11 Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5.12 Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see . Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.13 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.",

Adults The safety of esomeprazole magnesium\u00a0delayed-release capsules was evaluated in over 15,000 patients (aged 18 to 84 years) in clinical trials worldwide including over 8,500 patients in the United States and over 6,500 patients in Europe and Canada. Over 2,900 patients were treated in long-term studies for up to 6 to 12 months. The safety in the treatment of healing of EE in adults was assessed in four randomized comparative clinical trials, which included 1,240 patients who received esomeprazole magnesium 20 mg once daily, 2,434 patients on esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily, and 3,008 patients on omeprazole 20 mg once daily. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions (at least 1%) in all three groups were headache (5.5%, 5%, and 3.8%, respectively) and diarrhea (no difference among the three groups). Nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, and dry mouth occurred at similar rates among patients taking esomeprazole magnesium or omeprazole. Less common adverse reactions with an incidence of less than 1% are listed below by body system: Body as a Whole: abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, asthenia, back pain, chest pain, substernal chest pain, facial edema, peripheral edema, hot flushes, fatigue, fever, flu-like disorder, generalized edema, leg edema, malaise, pain, rigors; Cardiovascular: flushing, hypertension, tachycardia; Endocrine: goiter; Gastrointestinal: bowel irregularity, constipation aggravated, dyspepsia, dysphagia, dysplasia GI, epigastric pain, eructation, esophageal disorder, frequent stools, gastroenteritis, GI hemorrhage, GI symptoms not otherwise specified, hiccup, melena, mouth disorder, pharynx disorder, rectal disorder, serum gastrin increased, tongue disorder, tongue edema, ulcerative stomatitis, vomiting; Hearing: earache, tinnitus; Hematologic: anemia, anemia hypochromic, cervical lymphadenopathy, epistaxis, leukocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; Hepatic: bilirubinemia, hepatic function abnormal, SGOT increased, SGPT increased; Metabolic/Nutritional: glycosuria, hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, increased alkaline phosphatase, thirst, vitamin B12 deficiency, weight increase, weight decrease; Musculoskeletal: arthralgia, arthritis aggravated, arthropathy, cramps, fibromyalgia syndrome, hernia, polymyalgia rheumatica; Nervous System/Psychiatric: anorexia, apathy, appetite increased, confusion, depression aggravated, dizziness, hypertonia, nervousness, hypoesthesia, impotence, insomnia, migraine, migraine aggravated, paresthesia, sleep disorder, somnolence, tremor, vertigo, visual field defect; Reproductive: dysmenorrhea, menstrual disorder, vaginitis; Respiratory: asthma aggravated, coughing, dyspnea, larynx edema, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis; Skin and Appendages: acne, angioedema, dermatitis, pruritus, pruritus ani, rash, rash erythematous, rash maculo-papular, skin inflammation, sweating increased, urticaria; Special Senses: otitis media, parosmia, taste loss, taste perversion; Urogenital: abnormal urine, albuminuria, cystitis, dysuria, fungal infection, hematuria, micturition frequency, moniliasis, genital moniliasis, polyuria; Visual: conjunctivitis, vision abnormal. The following potentially clinically significant laboratory changes in clinical trials, irrespective of relationship to esomeprazole magnesium, were reported in 1% or less of patients: increased creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, serum gastrin, potassium, sodium, thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone [see . Decreases were seen in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, potassium, sodium, and thyroxine. Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] Endoscopic findings that were reported as adverse reactions include: duodenitis, esophagitis, esophageal stricture, esophageal ulceration, esophageal varices, gastric ulcer, gastritis, hernia, benign polyps or nodules, Barrett's esophagus, and mucosal discoloration. The incidence of adverse reactions during 6-month trials for the maintenance of healing of EE with esomeprazole magnesium 20 mg once daily was similar to placebo. There were no differences in types of adverse reactions seen during maintenance treatment up to 12 months compared to short-term treatment. Two placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 710 adult patients for the treatment of symptomatic GERD. The most common adverse reactions that were reported were: diarrhea (4%), headache (4%), and abdominal pain (4%). Combination Treatment with Esomeprazole Magnesium, Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin In clinical trials of H. pylori eradication of to reduce duodenal ulcer recurrence, no additional adverse reactions specific to the combination of esomeprazole magnesium delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin and clarithromycin were observed and were similar to those observed with esomeprazole magnesium, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin alone. The most frequently reported adverse reactions for patients who received esomeprazole magnesium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin for 10 days were diarrhea (9%), taste perversion (4%), and abdominal pain (4%). No adverse reactions were observed at higher rates with esomeprazole magnesium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin than were observed with esomeprazole magnesium alone. In clinical trials using of esomeprazole magnesium, amoxicillin and clarithromycin, no additional increased laboratory abnormalities particular to these drug combinations were observed. For more information on adverse reactions and laboratory changes with amoxicillin or clarithromycin, refer to Adverse Reactions section of the respective prescribing information. Pediatrics 1 Year to 17 Years of Age The safety of esomeprazole magnesium for delayed-release oral suspension was evaluated in 316 pediatric and adolescent patients aged 1 year to 17 years in four clinical trials for the treatment of symptomatic GERD [see . In 109 pediatric patients aged 1 year to 11 years, the most frequently reported (at least 1%) treatment-related adverse reactions in these patients were diarrhea (3%), headache (2%) and somnolence (2%). In 149 pediatric patients aged 12 years to 17 years the most frequently reported adverse reactions (at least 2%) were headache (8%), abdominal pain (3%), diarrhea (2%), and nausea (2%). Clinical Studies (14.3) ] 1 Month to Less Than 1 Year of Age The safety of esomeprazole magnesium was evaluated in 167 infants from 1 month to less than 1 year of age with GERD in three clinical trials [see . In a study that included 43 pediatric patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions (at least 5%) with esomeprazole magnesium were irritability and vomiting. In a study that included 98 pediatric patients, administered esomeprazole magnesium for up to 6 weeks (including 39 patients randomized to the withdrawal phase), reported adverse reactions were: abdominal pain (1%), regurgitation (1%), tachypnea (1%), and increased ALT (1%). Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of esomeprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reports are listed below by body system: Blood and Lymphatic: agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; Eye: blurred vision; Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis; stomatitis; microscopic colitis; fundic gland polyps; Hepatobiliary: hepatic failure, hepatitis with or without jaundice; Immune System: anaphylactic reaction/shock; systemic lupus erythematosus; Infections and Infestations: GI candidiasis; Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea; Metabolism and nutritional disorders: hypomagnesemia\u00a0(may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia) [see ; Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: muscular weakness, myalgia, bone fracture; Nervous System: hepatic encephalopathy, taste disturbance; Psychiatric: aggression, agitation, depression, hallucination; Renal and Urinary: interstitial nephritis; Reproductive System and Breast: gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction; Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal: bronchospasm; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue : alopecia, erythema multiforme, hyperhidrosis, photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (some fatal), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Adverse reactions associated with omeprazole may also be expected to occur with esomeprazole. See the full prescribing information for omeprazole for complete safety information.",
