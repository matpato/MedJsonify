    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Elevated liver enzymes and drug-induced liver injury: ALT, AST, and bilirubin elevations have occurred with pirfenidone including cases of drug-induced liver injury. In the postmarketing setting, non-serious and serious cases of drug-induced liver injury, including severe liver injury with fatal outcomes, have been reported. Monitor ALT, AST, and bilirubin before and during treatment. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Photosensitivity and rash: Photosensitivity and rash have been noted with pirfenidone. Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen and protective clothing daily. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. ( 5.2 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions ( SCAR ) : Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , and drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) have been reported in association with the use of pirfenidone tablets in the postmarketing setting. Interrupt pirfenidone tablets in case of signs or symptoms of SCAR. Permanently discontinue pirfenidone tablets if a SCAR is confirmed. ( 5.3 ) Gastrointestinal disorders: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain have occurred with pirfenidone. Temporary dosage reductions or discontinuations may be required. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes and Drug-Induced Liver Injury Cases of drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) have been observed with pirfenidone. In the postmarketing period, non-serious and serious cases of DILI, including severe liver injury with fatal outcome, have been reported. Patients treated with pirfenidone 2.403 mg/day in three Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of elevations in ALT or AST \u22653\u00d7 ULN than placebo patients ( 3.7% vs 0.8% , respectively ) . Elevations \u226510\u00d7ULN in ALT or AST occurred in 0.3% of patients in the pirfenidone 2.403 mg/day group and in 0.2% of patients in the placebo group. Increases in ALT and AST \u22653\u00d7 ULN were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation. Conduct liver function tests ( ALT, AST, and bilirubin ) prior to the initiation of therapy with pirfenidone, monthly for the first 6 months, every 3 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Measure liver function tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. Dosage modification or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 , 2.3 ) ] 5.2 Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash Patients treated with pirfenidone 2.403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 studies had a higher incidence of photosensitivity reactions ( 9% ) compared with patients treated with placebo ( 1% ) . The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurred during the initial 6 months. Instruct patients to avoid or minimize exposure to sunlight ( including sunlamps ) , to use a sunblock ( SPF 50 or higher ) , and to wear clothing that protects against sun exposure. Additionally, instruct patients to avoid concomitant medications known to cause photosensitivity. Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be necessary in some cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 ) ] 5.3 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCAR ) , including Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , have been reported in association with the use of pirfenidone tablets in the postmarketing setting. If signs or symptoms of SCAR occur, interrupt pirfenidone tablets treatment until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, permanently discontinue pirfenidone tablets. 5.4 Gastrointestinal Disorders In the clinical studies, gastrointestinal events of nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain were more frequently reported by patients in the pirfenidone treatment groups than in those taking placebo. Dosage reduction or interruption for gastrointestinal events was required in 18.5% of patients in the 2.403 mg/day group, as compared to 5.8% of patients in the placebo group; 2.2% of patients in the pirfenidone 2.403 mg/day group discontinued treatment due to a gastrointestinal event, as compared to 1% in the placebo group. The most common ( >2% ) gastrointestinal events that led to dosage reduction or interruption were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and dyspepsia. The incidence of gastrointestinal events was highest early in the course of treatment ( with highest incidence occurring during the initial 3 months ) and decreased over time. Dosage modifications may be necessary in some cases of gastrointestinal adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 ) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Liver Enzyme Elevations and Drug-Induced Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Photosensitivity Reaction or Rash [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Gastrointestinal Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( \u226510% ) are nausea, rash, abdominal pain, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, dizziness, vomiting, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, sinusitis, insomnia, weight decreased, and arthralgia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of pirfenidone has been evaluated in more than 1.400 subjects with over 170 subjects exposed to pirfenidone for more than 5 years in clinical trials. Pirfenidone was studied in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials ( Studies 1, 2, and 3 ) in which a total of 623 patients received 2.403 mg/day of pirfenidone and 624 patients received placebo. Subjects ages ranged from 40 to 80 years ( mean age of 67 years ) . Most patients were male ( 74% ) and Caucasian ( 95% ) . The mean duration of exposure to pirfenidone was 62 weeks ( range: 2 to 118 weeks ) in these 3 trials. At the recommended dosage of 2.403 mg/day, 14.6% of patients on pirfenidone compared to 9.6% on placebo permanently discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The most common ( >1% ) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were rash and nausea. The most common ( >3% ) adverse reactions leading to dosage reduction or interruption were rash, nausea, diarrhea, and photosensitivity reaction. The most common adverse reactions with an incidence of \u226510% and more frequent in the pirfenidone than placebo treatment group are listed in Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u226510% of Pirfenidone-Treated Patients and More Commonly Than Placebo in Studies 1, 2, and 3 % of Patients ( 0 to 118 Weeks ) Adverse Reaction Pirfenidone 2.403 mg/day ( N = 623 ) Placebo ( N = 624 ) Nausea 36% 16% Rash 30% 10% Abdominal Pain 1 24% 15% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 27% 25% Diarrhea 26% 20% Fatigue 26% 19% Headache 22% 19% Decreased Appetite 21% 8% Dyspepsia 19% 7% Dizziness 18% 11% Vomiting 13% 6% Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease 11% 7% Sinusitis 11% 10% Insomnia 10% 7% Weight Decreased 10% 5% Arthralgia 10% 7% 1 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and stomach discomfort. Adverse reactions occurring in \u22655 to <10% of pirfenidone-treated patients and more commonly than placebo are photosensitivity reaction ( 9% vs. 1% ) , pruritus ( 8% vs. 5% ) , asthenia ( 6% vs. 4% ) , dysgeusia ( 6% vs. 2% ) , and non-cardiac chest pain ( 5% vs. 4% ) . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions identified from clinical trials the following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pirfenidone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.
