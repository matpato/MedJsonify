Anaphylactic reactions have occurred with other budesonide formulations [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to budesonide or any of the ingredients in budesonide extended-release tablets ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression : May occur with treatment; monitor for signs and symptoms. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Transferring patients from systemic glucocorticoids : Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from glucocorticoid treatment with higher systemic effects to glucocorticoid treatment with lower systemic effects, such as budesonide extended-release tablets. Taper patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to budesonide extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection : Increased risk of viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal and helminthic infections, including potentially fatal varicella and measles infection. Monitor patients for new or worsening infection and consider drug discontinuation. Avoid use in patients with fungal infections, Strongyloides infestation, cerebral malaria and ocular herpes simplex. Screen for hepatitis B infection. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma :  Reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1\tHypercorticism and Adrenal Axis Suppression Systemic effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with use of corticosteroids, including budesonide extended-release tablets. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercorticism and adrenal axis suppression during treatment with budesonide extended-release tablets. Patients with moderate to severe liver disease should be monitored for increased signs and/or symptoms of hypercorticism. Discontinuing the use of budesonide extended-release tablets should be considered in these patients [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] Glucocorticosteroids, including budesonide extended-release tablets, can reduce the response of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to stress. In situations where patients are subject to surgery or other stress situations, supplementation with a systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended. 5.2\tTransferring Patients from Systemic Glucocorticosteroid Therapy Care is needed in patients who are transferred from glucocorticosteroid treatment with higher systemic effects to glucocorticosteroids with lower systemic effects, such as budesonide extended-release tablets, since symptoms attributed to withdrawal of steroid therapy, including those of acute adrenal suppression or benign intracranial hypertension, may develop. Adrenocortical function monitoring may be required in these patients, and the dose of glucocorticosteroid treatment with high systemic effects should be reduced cautiously. Replacement of systemic glucocorticosteroids with budesonide extended-release tablets may unmask allergies (e.g., rhinitis and eczema), which were previously controlled by the systemic drug. 5.3\tImmunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including budesonide extended-release tablets, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: \u2022 Reduce resistance to new infections \u2022 Exacerbate existing infections \u2022 Increase the risk of disseminated infections \u2022 Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections \u2022 Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor patients for the development of infection and consider discontinuation of budesonide extended-release tablets if the patient develops an infection while on treatment. Tuberculosis If budesonide extended-release tablets are used in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged budesonide extended-release tablets therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including budesonide extended-release tablets. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are non-immune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles : \u2022 If a budesonide extended-release tablets-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. \u2022 If a budesonide extended-release tablets -treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated . Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including budesonide extended-release tablets. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with budesonide extended-release tablets. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy . Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including budesonide extended-release tablets, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid budesonide extended-release tablets use in the presence of such infections. For patients on chronic budesonide extended-release tablets therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, budesonide extended-release tablets withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended . Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including budesonide extended-release tablets, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating budesonide extended-release tablets in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Avoid budesonide extended-release tablets in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infection. Corticosteroids-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides superinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including budesonide extended-release tablets, in patients with cerebral malaria . 5.4\tKaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma . 5.5\tIncreased Systemic Glucocorticoid Susceptibility Reduced liver function affects the elimination of glucocorticosteroids, and increased systemic availability of oral budesonide has been demonstrated in patients with liver cirrhosis [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] 5.6\tOther Glucocorticosteroid Effects Caution should be taken in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma or cataracts, or with a family history of diabetes or glaucoma, or with any other condition where glucocorticosteroids may have unwanted effects.",

The safety of budesonide extended-release tablets has been evaluated in controlled and open-label clinical trials which enrolled a combined total of 1,105 patients with ulcerative colitis. In two 8-week, placebo-controlled studies in patients with active disease (Study 1 and Study 2), a total of 255 patients received budesonide extended-release tablets 9 mg, 254 patients received budesonide extended-release tablets 6 mg, and 258 patients received placebo. They ranged in age from 18-77 years (mean = 43), 56% were male, and 75% were Caucasian. The most common adverse reactions were headache, nausea, decreased blood cortisol, upper abdominal pain, fatigue, flatulence, abdominal distension, acne, urinary tract infection, arthralgia, and constipation. The adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on therapy with budesonide extended-release tablets 9 mg are summarized in Table 1.

Study 3 was an open-label study evaluating budesonide extended-release tablets 9 mg once daily for 8 weeks in 60 patients who had previously completed an 8-week induction study (Study 1) but had not achieved remission. Among patients who took budesonide extended-release tablets 9 mg up to 16 weeks cumulatively across Study 1 and Study 3 combined, similar rates of adverse reactions and glucocorticoid-related effects were seen compared to those who took budesonide extended-release tablets 9 mg for 8 weeks in Study 1. In Study 4, the safety of long-term treatment with budesonide extended-release tablets 6 mg was evaluated in a placebo-controlled 12-month maintenance study of 123 patients. Patients who had previously completed 8 weeks of therapy in any induction study (Study 1, 2, or 3) and were in remission were randomized to budesonide extended-release tablets 6 mg or placebo once daily for 12 months. In patients who took budesonide extended-release tablets 6 mg for up to 12 months, similar rates of adverse reactions were seen between placebo and budesonide extended-release tablets 6 mg. After up to 12 months of study treatment, 77% (27/35) of the patients in the budesonide extended-release tablets 6 mg and 74% (29/39) of the patients in the placebo treatment groups had normal bone density scans. In Study 4, the glucocorticoid-related effects were similar in patients with up to 12 months of therapy with budesonide extended-release tablets 6 mg and placebo (Table 3).

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting or causal connection to budesonide extended-release tablets, or a combination of these factors.
