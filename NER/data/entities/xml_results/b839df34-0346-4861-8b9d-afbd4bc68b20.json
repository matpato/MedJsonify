If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate medical treatment and consider slowing the infusion, interrupting or discontinuing the VYONDYS 53 therapy. ( 2.3 , 4 , 5.1 ) Kidney Toxicity: Based on animal data, may cause kidney toxicity. Kidney function should be monitored; creatinine may not be a reliable measure of renal function in DMD patients.

If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate medical treatment and consider slowing the infusion, interrupting, or discontinuing the VYONDYS 53 therapy and monitor until the condition resolves [see Dosage and Administration ( VYONDYS 53 is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to golodirsen or to any of the inactive ingredients in VYONDYS 53 2.4 )]. [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kidney Toxicity Kidney toxicity was observed in animals who received golodirsen [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Although kidney toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies with VYONDYS 53, the clinical experience with VYONDYS 53 is limited, and kidney toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides. Kidney function should be monitored in patients taking VYONDYS 53. Because of the effect of reduced skeletal muscle mass on creatinine measurements, creatinine may not be a reliable measure of kidney function in DMD patients. Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting VYONDYS 53. Consider also measuring glomerular filtration rate using an exogenous filtration marker before starting VYONDYS 53. During treatment, monitor urine dipstick every month, and serum cystatin C and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio every three months. Only urine expected to be free of excreted VYONDYS 53 should be used for monitoring of urine protein. Urine obtained on the day of VYONDYS 53 infusion prior to the infusion, or urine obtained at least 48 hours after the most recent infusion, may be used.  Alternatively, use a laboratory test that does not use the reagent pyrogallol red, as this reagent has the potential to cross react with any VYONDYS 53 that is excreted in the urine and thus lead to a false positive result for urine protein. 8.4 )] If a persistent increase in serum cystatin C or proteinuria is detected, refer to a pediatric nephrologist for further evaluation.",

In the VYONDYS 53 clinical development program, 58 patients received at least one intravenous dose of VYONDYS 53, ranging between 4 mg/kg (0.13 times the recommended dosage) and 30 mg/kg (the recommended dosage). All patients were male and had genetically confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Age at study entry was 6 to 13 years. Most (86%) patients were Caucasian. VYONDYS 53 was studied in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In Study 1 Part 1, patients were randomized to receive once-weekly intravenous infusions of VYONDYS 53 (n=8) in four increasing dose levels from 4 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg or placebo (n=4), for at least 2 weeks at each level. All patients who participated in Study 1 Part 1 (n=12) were continued into Study 1 Part 2, an open-label extension, during which they received VYONDYS\u00a053 at a dose of 30 mg/kg IV once weekly [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] In Study 2, patients received VYONDYS 53 (n=33) 30 mg/kg or placebo (n=17) IV once weekly for up to 96 weeks, after which all patients received VYONDYS 53 at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Adverse reactions observed in at least 20% of treated patients in the placebo-controlled sections of Studies 1 and 2 are shown in Table\u00a01 .
