    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Need to Evaluate for Co-morbid Diagnoses: Reevaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of use. ( 5.1 ) Abnormal thinking, behavioral changes, complex behaviors: May include \u201cSleep-driving\u201d and hallucinations. Immediately evaluate any new onset behavioral changes. ( 5.2 ) Depression: Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur. Prescribe the least amount feasible to avoid intentional overdose. ( 5.3 ) CNS-depressant effects: Use can impair alertness and motor coordination. Avoid engaging in hazardous activities such as operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery after taking drug. ( 5.4 ) Do not use with alcohol. ( 5.4 , 7.3 ) Potential additive effects when used in combination with CNS depressants or sedating antihistamines. Dose reduction may be needed. ( 5.4 , 7.4 ) Patients with severe sleep apnea: Doxepin is ordinarily not recommended for use in this population. ( 8.7 ) 5.1 Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated. Exacerbation of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder. Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with hypnotic drugs. 5.2 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes Complex behaviors such as \u201csleep-driving\u201d (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported with hypnotics. These events can occur in hypnotic-naive as well as in hypnotic-experienced persons. Although behaviors such as \u201csleep-driving\u201d may occur with hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose. Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of doxepin should be strongly considered for patients who report a \u201csleep-driving\u201d episode. Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a hypnotic. As with \u201csleep-driving\u201d, patients usually do not remember these events. Amnesia, anxiety and other neuro-psychiatric symptoms may occur unpredictably. 5.3 Suicide Risk and Worsening of Depression In primarily depressed patients, worsening of depression, including suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides), has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics. Doxepin, the active ingredient in doxepin tablets, is an antidepressant at doses 10- to 100-fold higher than in doxepin. Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Risk from the lower dose of doxepin\u00a0in doxepin tablets\u00a0can not be excluded. It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced, spontaneous in origin, or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder. Nonetheless, the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation. 5.4 CNS Depressant Effects After taking doxepin, patients should confine their activities to those necessary to prepare for bed. Patients should avoid engaging in hazardous activities, such as operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery, at night after taking doxepin, and should be cautioned about potential impairment in the performance of such activities that may occur the day following ingestion. When taken with doxepin, the sedative effects of alcoholic beverages, sedating antihistamines, and other CNS depressants may be potentiated [ Patients should not consume alcohol with doxepin see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3 , 7.4 )]. [ Patients should be cautioned about potential additive effects of doxepin used in combination with CNS depressants or sedating antihistamines see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.3 )].

    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling: Abnormal thinking and behavioral changes . [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Suicide risk and worsening of depression [ . ] see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) CNS Depressant effects [ . ] see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) The most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, reported in \u2265 2% of patients treated with doxepin, and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, were somnolence/sedation, nausea, and upper respiratory tract infection. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 and or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The pre-marketing development program for doxepin tablets included doxepin HCl exposures in 1017 subjects (580 insomnia patients and 437 healthy subjects) from 12 studies conducted in the United States. 863 of these subjects (580 insomnia patients and 283 healthy subjects) participated in six randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy studies with doxepin doses of 1 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg for up to 3-months in duration. Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials\u00a0of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials\u00a0of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. However, data from the doxepin studies provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contributions of drug and non-drug factors to adverse reaction incidence rates in the populations studied. Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment The percentage of subjects discontinuing Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials for an adverse reaction was 0.6% in the placebo group compared to 0.4%, 1.0%, and 0.7% in the doxepin 1 mg, 3 mg, and 6 mg groups, respectively. No reaction that resulted in discontinuation occurred at a rate greater than 0.5%. Adverse Reactions Observed at an Incidence of \u2265 2% in Controlled Trials Table 1 shows the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions from three long-term (28 to 85 days) placebo-controlled studies of doxepin in adult (N=221) and elderly (N=494) subjects with chronic insomnia. Reactions reported by Investigators were classified using a modified MedDRA dictionary of preferred terms for purposes of establishing incidence. The table includes only reactions that occurred in 2% or more of subjects who received doxepin 3 mg or 6 mg in which the incidence in subjects treated with doxepin was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated subjects. Table 1 Incidence (%) of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions in Long-term Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials System Organ\u00a0Class Preferred Term* Placebo (N=278) Doxepin 3 mg (N=157) Doxepin 6 mg (N=203) Nervous System\u00a0Disorders Somnolence/Sedation 4 6 9 Infections and\u00a0Infestations Upper Respiratory\u00a0Tract Infection/Nasopharyngitis 2 4 2 Gastroenteritis 0 2 0 Gastrointestinal\u00a0Disorders Nausea 1 2 2 Vascular Disorders Hypertension 0 3 < 1 * Includes reactions that occurred at a rate of \u22652% in any doxepin-treated group and\u00a0at\u00a0a higher rate than\u00a0placebo. The most common treatment-emergent adverse reaction in the placebo and each of the doxepin dose groups was somnolence/sedation. 6.2 Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sleep-promoting Drugs Residual Pharmacological Effect in Insomnia Trials Five randomized, placebo-controlled studies in adults and the elderly assessed next-day psychomotor function within 1 hour of awakening utilizing the digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying test (SCT), and visual analog scale (VAS) for sleepiness, following night time administration of doxepin. In a one-night, double-blind study conducted in 565 healthy adult subjects experiencing transient insomnia, doxepin 6 mg showed modest negative changes in SCT and VAS. In a 35-day, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of doxepin 3 and 6 mg in 221 adults with chronic insomnia, small decreases in the DSST and SCT occurred in the 6 mg group. In a 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in 240 elderly subjects with chronic insomnia, doxepin 1 mg and 3 mg was comparable to placebo on DSST, SCT, and VAS. 6.3 Other Reactions Observed During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of Doxepin Doxepin was administered to 1017 subjects in clinical trials in the United States. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions recorded by clinical investigators were standardized using a modified MedDRA dictionary of preferred terms. The following is a list of MedDRA terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by subjects treated with doxepin. Adverse reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse reactions are those that occurred on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 subjects; Infrequent adverse reactions are those that occurred in fewer than 1/100 subjects and more than 1/1000 subjects.
