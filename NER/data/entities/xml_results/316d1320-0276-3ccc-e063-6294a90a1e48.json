    "indications_original": "Indications and Usage SSKI \u00ae (potassium iodide oral solution, USP) is for use as an expectorant in the symptomatic treatment of chronic pulmonary diseases where tenacious mucus complicates the problem, including bronchial asthma, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema.",
    "contraindications_original": "Contraindications Contraindicated in patients with a known sensitivity to iodides.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "Warnings Potassium iodide can cause fetal harm, abnormal thyroid function, and goiter when administered to a pregnant woman. Because of the possible development of fetal goiter, if the drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant during therapy, apprise the patient of the potential hazard.Precautions General In some patients, prolonged use of iodides can lead to hypothyroidism. Iodides should be used with caution in patients having Addison's disease, cardiac disease, hyperthyroidism, myotonia congenita, tuberculosis, acute bronchitis, or renal function impairment. Drug Interactions Concurrent use with lithium or antithyroid drugs may potentiate the hypothyroid and goitrogenic effects of these medications. Concurrent use with potassium-containing medications, potassium-sparing diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) may result in hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Thyroid function tests may be altered by iodide. Pregnancy see \" Warnings \" section. Nursing Mothers Potassium iodide is excreted in breast milk. Use by nursing mothers may cause skin rash and thyroid suppression in the infant. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "Adverse Reactions The most frequent adverse reactions to potassium iodide are stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash, and salivary gland swelling or tenderness. Less frequent adverse reactions include gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion, irregular heartbeat, numbness, tingling, pain or weakness in hands or feet, unusual tiredness, weakness or heaviness of legs, fever, and swelling of neck or throat. Thyroid adenoma, goiter, and myxedema are possible side effects. Iodism or chronic iodine poisoning may occur during prolonged treatment or with the use of high doses. The symptoms of iodism include burning of mouth or throat, severe headache, metallic taste, soreness of teeth and gums, symptoms of head cold, irritation of the eyes with swelling of the eyelids, unusual increase in salivation, acneform skin lesions in the seborrheic areas, and rarely, severe skin eruptions. If symptoms of iodism appear, the drug should be withdrawn and the patient given appropriate supportive therapy. Hypersensitivity to iodides may occur and may be manifested by angioedema, cutaneous and mucosal hemorrhage, and signs and symptoms resembling serum sickness, such as fever, arthralgia, lymph node enlargement, and eosinophilia.",
