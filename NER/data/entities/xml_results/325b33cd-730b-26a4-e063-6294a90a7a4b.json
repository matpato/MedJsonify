Pituitary Thyrotropin (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone, TSH) Suppression THYQUIDITY\u00a0is indicated as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Limitations of Use: THYQUIDITY\u00a0is not indicated for suppression of benign thyroid nodules and nontoxic diffuse goiter in iodine-sufficient patients as there are no clinical benefits and overtreatment with THYQUIDITY\u00a0may induce hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. THYQUIDITY\u00a0is not indicated for treatment of hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis. THYQUIDITY\u00a0is levothyroxine sodium (T4) indicated for: Hypothyroidism: As replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiac adverse reactions in the elderly and in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease: Initiate THYQUIDITY at less than the full replacement dose because of the increased risk of cardiac adverse reactions, including atrial fibrillation. ( 2.3 , 5.1 , 8.5 ) Myxedema coma: Do not use oral thyroid hormone drug products to treat myxedema coma. (5.2) Acute adrenal crisis in patients with concomitant adrenal insufficiency: Treat with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiation of THYQUIDITY treatment. (5.3) Prevention of hyperthyroidism or incomplete treatment of hypothyroidism: Proper dose titration and careful monitoring is critical to prevent the persistence of hypothyroidism or the development of hyperthyroidism. (5.4) Worsening of diabetic control: Therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing thyroid hormone therapy. (5.5) Decreased bone mineral density associated with thyroid hormone over- replacement: Over-replacement can increase bone resorption and decrease bone mineral density. Give the lowest effective dose. (5.6) 5.1 Cardiac Adverse Reactions in the Elderly and in Patients with Underlying Cardiovascular Disease Over-treatment with levothyroxine may cause an increase in heart rate, cardiac wall thickness, and cardiac contractility and may precipitate angina or arrhythmias, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in elderly patients. Initiate THYQUIDITY\u00a0therapy in this population at lower doses than those recommended in younger individuals or in patients without cardiac disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias during surgical procedures in patients with coronary artery disease receiving suppressive THYQUIDITY\u00a0therapy. Monitor patients receiving concomitant THYQUIDITY\u00a0and sympathomimetic agents for signs and symptoms of coronary insufficiency. If cardiac symptoms develop or worsen, reduce the THYQUIDITY\u00a0dose or withhold for one week and restart at a lower dose. 5.2 Myxedema Coma Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Use of oral thyroid hormone drug products is not recommended to treat myxedema coma. Administer thyroid hormone products formulated for intravenous administration to treat myxedema coma. 5.3 Acute Adrenal Crisis in Patients with Concomitant Adrenal Insufficiency Thyroid hormone increases metabolic clearance of glucocorticoids.\u00a0 Initiation of thyroid hormone therapy prior to initiating glucocorticoid therapy may precipitate an acute adrenal crisis in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Treat patients with adrenal insufficiency with replacement glucocorticoids prior to initiating treatment with THYQUIDITY [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Prevention of Hyperthyroidism or Incomplete Treatment of Hypothyroidism THYQUIDITY\u00a0has a narrow therapeutic index. Over- or undertreatment with THYQUIDITY\u00a0may have negative effects on growth and development, cardiovascular function, bone metabolism, reproductive function, cognitive function, emotional state, gastrointestinal function, and glucose and lipid metabolism [see . Titrate the dose of THYQUIDITY\u00a0carefully and monitor response to titration to avoid these effects Use in Specific Populations - Pediatric Use (8.4) ] [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Monitor for the presence of drug or food interactions when using THYQUIDITY\u00a0and adjust the dose as necessary [see Drug Interactions (7.9) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.5 Worsening of Diabetic Control Addition of levothyroxine therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control after starting, changing, or discontinuing THYQUIDITY [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 5.6\u00a0Decreased Bone Mineral Density Associated with Thyroid Hormone Over-Replacement Increased bone resorption and decreased bone mineral density may occur as a result of levothyroxine over-replacement, particularly in post-menopausal women. The increased bone resorption may be associated with increased serum levels and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorous, elevations in bone alkaline phosphatase, and suppressed serum parathyroid hormone levels. Administer the minimum dose of THYQUIDITY\u00a0that achieves the desired clinical and biochemical response to mitigate this risk.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with THYQUIDITY\u00a0therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage [see , Warnings and Precautions (5) Overdosage (10) ] . They include the following: General: fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, heat intolerance, fever, excessive sweating Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, insomnia Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness, muscle spasm Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest Respiratory: dyspnea Gastrointestinal: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in liver function tests Dermatologic: hair loss, flushing, rash Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility Seizures have been reported rarely with the institution of levothyroxine therapy. Adverse Reactions in Children Pseudotumor cerebri and slipped capital femoral epiphysis have been reported in children receiving levothyroxine therapy. Overtreatment may result in craniosynostosis in infants and premature closure of the epiphyses in children with resultant compromised adult height. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to inactive ingredients have occurred in patients treated with thyroid hormone products. These include urticaria, pruritus, skin rash, flushing, angioedema, various gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), fever, arthralgia, serum sickness, and wheezing. Hypersensitivity to levothyroxine itself is not known to occur. Adverse reactions associated with THYQUIDITY\u00a0therapy are primarily those of hyperthyroidism due to therapeutic overdosage: arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, dyspnea, muscle spasm, headache, nervousness, irritability, insomnia, tremors, muscle weakness, increased appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, heat intolerance, menstrual irregularities, and skin rash.
