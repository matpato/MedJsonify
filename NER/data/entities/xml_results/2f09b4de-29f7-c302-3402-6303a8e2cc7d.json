Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. - Interstitial\u00a0lung disease -Tumor\u00a0lysis syndrome - Injection\u00a0site necrosis - Sweet\u2019s\u00a0syndrome\u00a0(acute\u00a0febrile\u00a0neutrophilic\u00a0dermatosis) - Necrotizing\u00a0fasciitis\u00a0(including\u00a0fatal cases) - Differentiation\u00a0syndrome - Pericardial effusion - Pericarditis - Cutaneous vasculitis",
