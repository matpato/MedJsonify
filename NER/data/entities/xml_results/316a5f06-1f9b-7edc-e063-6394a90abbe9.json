    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS QT interval prolongation: Can occur with ranolazine. Little data available on high doses, long exposure, use with QT interval-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants causing prolonged QT interval, in patients with a family history of(or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. (\n          5.1) Renal failure: Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets. (\n          5.2) 5.1 QT Interval Prolongation Ranolazine blocks I Kr and prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner. Clinical experience in an acute coronary syndrome population did not show an increased risk of proarrhythmia or sudden death [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . However, there is little experience with high doses (>1000 mg twice daily) or exposure, other QT-prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, in patients with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, or in patients with known acquired QT interval prolongation. 5.2 Renal Failure Acute renal failure has been observed in some patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCL] <30 mL/min) while taking ranolazine extended-release tablets. If acute renal failure develops (e.g., marked increase in serum creatinine associated with an increase in blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), discontinue ranolazine extended-release tablets and treat appropriately [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Monitor renal function after initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL<60 mL/min) for increases in serum creatinine accompanied by an increase in BUN.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>4% and more common than with placebo) are dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact SunGen Pharma, LLC at 1-609-606-1060 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2018 patients with chronic angina were treated with ranolazine in controlled clinical trials. Of the patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets, 1026 were enrolled in three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies (CARISA, ERICA, MARISA) of up to 12 weeks\u2019 duration. In addition, upon study completion, 1251 patients received treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets in open-label, long-term studies; 1227 patients were exposed to ranolazine extended-release tablets for more than 1 year, 613 patients for more than 2 years, 531 patients for more than 3 years, and 326 patients for more than 4 years. At recommended doses, about 6% of patients discontinued treatment with ranolazine extended-release tablets because of an adverse event in controlled studies in angina patients compared to about 3% on placebo. The most common adverse events that led to discontinuation more frequently on ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo were dizziness (1.3% versus 0.1%), nausea (1% versus 0%), asthenia, constipation, and headache (each about 0.5% versus 0%). Doses above 1000 mg twice daily are poorly tolerated. In controlled clinical trials of angina patients, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse reactions (>4% and more common on ranolazine extended-release tablets than on placebo) were dizziness (6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipation (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%). Dizziness may be dose-related. In open-label, long-term treatment studies, a similar adverse reaction profile was observed. The following additional adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 0.5 to 4.0% in patients treated with ranolazine extended-release tablets and were more frequent than the incidence observed in placebo-treated patients: Cardiac Disorders \u2013 bradycardia, palpitations Ear and Labyrinth Disorders \u2013 tinnitus, vertigo Eye Disorders \u2013 blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, dyspepsia General Disorders and Administrative Site Adverse Events \u2013 asthenia, peripheral edema Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 anorexia Nervous System Disorders \u2013 syncope (vasovagal) Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 confusional state Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 hematuria Respiratory , Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \u2013 dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 hyperhidrosis Vascular Disorders \u2013 hypotension, orthostatic hypotension Other (<0.5%) but potentially medically important adverse reactions observed more frequently with ranolazine extended-release tablets than placebo treatment in all controlled studies included: angioedema, renal failure, eosinophilia, chromaturia, blood urea increased, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, tremor, pulmonary fibrosis, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and pancytopenia. A large clinical trial in acute coronary syndrome patients was unsuccessful in demonstrating a benefit for ranolazine extended-release tablets, but there was no apparent proarrhythmic effect in these high-risk patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Laboratory Abnormalities: Ranolazine extended-release tablets produce elevations of serum creatinine by 0.1 mg/dL, regardless of previous renal function, likely because of inhibition of creatinine\u2019s tubular secretion. In general, the elevation has a rapid onset, shows no signs of progression during long-term therapy, is reversible after discontinuation of ranolazine extended-release tablets, and is not accompanied by changes in BUN. In healthy volunteers, ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily had no effect upon the glomerular filtration rate. More marked and progressive increases in serum creatinine, associated with increases in BUN or potassium, indicating acute renal failure, have been reported after initiation of ranolazine extended-release tablets in patients with severe renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ranolazine extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Nervous System Disorders - Abnornal coordination, myoclonus, paresthesia, tremor, and other serious neurologic adverse events have been reported to occur, sometimes concurrently, in patients taking ranolazine. The onset of events was often associated with an increase in ranolazine dose or exposure. Many patients reported symptom resolution following drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders \u2013 Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in diabetic patients on antidiabetic medication. Psychiatric Disorders \u2013 hallucination Renal and Urinary Disorders \u2013 dysuria, urinary retention Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \u2013 angioedema, pruritus, rash",
