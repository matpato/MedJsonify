    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitor patient for acute severe hypertension. (5.1) Avoid extravasation into tissues, which can cause local necrosis. (5.2) Do not inject into buttocks, digits, hands, or feet. (5.3) Potential for pulmonary edema, which may be fatal. (5.4) May constrict renal blood vessels and decrease urine formation. (5.5) May induce potentially serious cardiac arrhythmias or aggravate angina pectoris, particularly in patients with underlying heart disease. (5.6) Presence of sulfite in this product should not deter use. (5.9) 5.1 Hypertension When Epinephrine Injection is administered intravenously, titrate the infusion while monitoring vital signs . Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring and central venous pressure monitoring are recommended. Because of varying response to epinephrine, dangerously high blood pressure may occur [see Drug Interactions (7)] . 5.2 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis with Intravenous Infusion When Epinephrine Injection is administered intravenously, the infusion site should be checked frequently for free flow. Avoid extravasation of epinephrine into the tissues, to prevent local necrosis. Blanching along the course of the infused vein, sometimes without obvious extravasation, may be attributed to vasa vasorum constriction with increased permeability of the vein wall, permitting some leakage. This also may progress on rare occasions to superficial slough. Hence, if blanching occurs, consider changing the infusion site at intervals to allow the effects of local vasoconstriction to subside. Antidote for Extravasation Ischemia: To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, infiltrate the area with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of phentolamine , an adrenergic blocking agent. Use a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle, with the solution being infiltrated liberally throughout the area, which is easily identified by its cold, hard, and pallid appearance. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. 5.3 Incorrect Locations of Injection for Anaphylaxis When Epinephrine Injection is used for the treatment of anaphylaxis, the most appropriate location for administration is into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) because of its location, size, and available blood flow. Injection into (or near) smaller muscles, such as in the deltoid, is not recommended due to possible differences in absorption associated with this use. Do not administer repeated injections of epinephrine at the same site, as the resulting vasoconstriction may cause tissue necrosis. Do not inject into buttock. Injection into the buttock may not provide effective treatment of anaphylaxis and has been associated with the development of Clostridial infections (gas gangrene). Cleansing with alcohol does not kill bacterial spores, and therefore, does not lower this risk. Do not inject into digits, hands, or feet. Epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor. Accidental injection into the digits, hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area and has been associated with tissue necrosis. 5.4 Pulmonary Edema When Epinephrine Injection is administered intravenously, there is risk of pulmonary edema because of the peripheral constriction and cardiac stimulation produced. Treatment of pulmonary edema consists of a rapidly acting alpha-adrenergic blocking drug (such as phentolamine mesylate) and respiratory support. 5.5 Renal Impairment Intravenously administered epinephrine initially may produce constriction of renal blood vessels and decrease urine formation. 5.6 Cardiac Arrhythmias and Ischemia Epinephrine may induce cardiac arrhythmias and angina pectoris in patients, especially patients suffering from coronary artery disease, organic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, or patients who are receiving drugs that sensitize the myocardium [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Treatment of arrhythmias consists of administration of a beta-adrenergic blocking drug (such as propranolol). 5.7 Serious Infections at the Injection Site Rare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia (gas gangrene), have been reported at the injection site following epinephrine injection for anaphylaxis. Clostridium spores can be present on the skin and introduced into the deep tissue with subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. While cleansing with alcohol may reduce presence of bacteria on the skin, alcohol cleansing does not kill Clostridium spores. To decrease the risk of Clostridium infection, do not inject Epinephrine Injection into the buttock [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Advise patients to seek medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of infection, such as persistent redness, warmth, swelling, or tenderness, at the epinephrine injection site. 5.8 Other Disease Interactions Epinephrine should be administered with caution to patients with hyperthyroidism, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes mellitus, pheochromocytoma, elderly individuals, and pregnant women. Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease may experience psychomotor agitation or notice a temporary worsening of symptoms. Diabetic patients may experience transient increases in blood sugar. Despite these concerns, the presence of these conditions is not a contraindication to epinephrine administration in an acute, life-threatening situation. 5.9 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic or other emergency situations even though this product contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may in other products cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms or life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible persons. The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life-threatening situation may not be satisfactory. The presence of sulfite(s) in this product should not deter administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine are headache; anxiety; apprehensiveness; restlessness; tremor; weakness; dizziness; sweating; palpitations; pallor; peripheral coldness; nausea/vomiting; and/or respiratory difficulties. Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, rapid rises in blood pressure producing cerebral hemorrhage, and angina have occurred. (6.1, 6.2) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact BPI Labs, LLC at (727) 471-0850 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Adverse Reactions associated with Epinephrine Infusion (for Hypotension associated with Septic Shock) The following adverse reactions associated with the infusion of epinephrine were identified in the literature. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular disorders : tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, limb ischemia, pulmonary edema Gastrointestinal disorders : Nausea, vomiting General disorders and administrative site conditions : Chest pain, extravasation, Metabolic : hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hypokalemia, lactic acidosis Nervous system disorders : Headache, nervousness, paresthesia, tremor, stroke, central nervous system bleeding Psychiatric disorders : Excitability Renal disorders : Renal insufficiency Respiratory : Pulmonary edema, rales Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Diaphoresis, pallor, piloerection, skin blanching, skin necrosis with extravasation 6.2 Adverse Reactions associated with Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Use (for Anaphylaxis) Common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine include anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness, tremor, weakness, dizziness, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea and vomiting, headache, and respiratory difficulties. These symptoms occur in some persons receiving therapeutic doses of epinephrine, but are more likely to occur in patients with heart disease, hypertension, or hyperthyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Due to the lack of randomized, controlled clinical trials of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis, the true incidence of adverse reactions associated with the systemic use of epinephrine is difficult to determine. Adverse reactions reported in observational trials, case reports, and studies are listed below by body system: Cardiovascular [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] : angina, arrhythmias, hypertension, pallor, palpitations, tachyarrhythmia, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and ventricular ectopy. Angina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease. Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have occurred, particularly in patients with underlying organic heart disease or patients receiving drugs that sensitize the heart to arrhythmias. Rapid rises in blood pressure associated with epinephrine use have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Respiratory : respiratory difficulties. Neurological : dizziness, disorientation, excitability, headache, impaired memory, lightheadedness, nervousness, panic, psychomotor agitation, sleepiness, tingling, tremor, and weakness. Psychiatric : anxiety, apprehensiveness, restlessness. Gastrointestinal : nausea, vomiting. Skin : sweating. Other : Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease may experience psychomotor agitation or a temporary worsening of symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Diabetic patients may experience transient increases in blood sugar [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Accidental injection into the digits, hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Adverse events experienced as a result of an injection into these areas include increased heart rate, local reactions including injection site pallor, coldness, hypoesthesia, and tissue loss, or injury at the injection site resulting in bruising, bleeding, discoloration, erythema, and skeletal injury. Injection into the buttock has resulted in cases of gas gangrene [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Rare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia (gas gangrene), have been reported following epinephrine injection in the thigh [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ].",
