    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intravitreal injections have been associated with endophthalmitis, eye inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, and retinal detachments. Patients should be monitored following the injection. ( 5.1 ) Intraocular Pressure ( IOP ) Increase : Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity, and fields of vision. ( 5.2 ) Cataracts : Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. ( 5.3 ) Delayed Healing : The use of corticosteroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. ( 5.4 ) Corneal and Scleral Melting : In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, ophthalmic corticosteroids may lead to perforation of the globe. ( 5.5 ) Bacterial Infections : Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated. ( 5.6 ) Viral Infections : Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye ( including herpes simplex ) . ( 5.7 ) Fungal Infections : Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local corticosteroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. ( 5.8 ) Implant Migration : The implant may migrate into the anterior chamber if the posterior lens capsule is not intact. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Intravitreal Injection-related Effects Intravitreal injections, including those with ILUVIEN, have been associated with endophthalmitis, eye inflammation, increased or decreased intraocular pressure, and choroidal or retinal detachments. For patients with non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment, hypotony has been observed within 24 hours of injection and has resolved within 2 weeks. Patients should be monitored following the intravitreal injection [see . Patients may experience temporary blurred vision after injection of the implant. Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] 5.2 Intraocular Pressure ( IOP ) Increase Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored during the course of the treatment. 5.3 Cataracts The use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. 5.4 Delayed Corneal Wound Healing The use of corticosteroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. 5.5 Corneal and Scleral Melting Various ocular diseases and long-term use of topical corticosteroids have been known to cause corneal and scleral thinning. Use of ophthalmic corticosteroids in the presence of thin corneal or scleral tissue may lead to perforation of the globe. 5.6 Bacterial Infections Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host immune response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. Acute purulent or parasitic infections of the eye may be masked or activity enhanced by the presence of corticosteroid medication. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be reevaluated. 5.7 Viral Infections Use of ocular corticosteroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye ( including herpes simplex ) . Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution; frequent slit lamp microscopy is recommended. 5.8 Fungal Infections Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local corticosteroid application. Fungus invasion should be suspected in any persistent corneal ulceration where a corticosteroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. 5.9 Risk of Implant Migration Patients in whom the posterior capsule of the lens is absent or has a tear are at risk of implant migration into the anterior chamber.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions reported are cataract development and increases in intraocular pressure. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alimera Sciences, Inc. at 1-844-445-8843 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids including ILUVIEN include cataract formation and subsequent cataract surgery, elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. Diabetic Macular Edema ILUVIEN was studied in two multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled, double-masked trials in which patients with diabetic macular edema ( DME ) were treated with either ILUVIEN ( n=375 ) or sham ( n=185 ) . Table 1 summarizes safety data available when the last subject completed the last 36 month follow up visit for the two primary ILUVIEN trials. In these trials, subjects were eligible for retreatment no earlier than 12 months after study entry. Over the three year follow up period, approximately 75% of the ILUVIEN treated subjects received only one ILUVIEN implant. The most common ocular ( study eye ) and non-ocular adverse reactions are shown in Tables 1 and 2 : Table 1: Ocular Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22651% of DME Patients and Non-ocular Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22655% of DME Patients 1 Includes cataract, cataract nuclear, cataract subcapsular, cataract cortical and cataract diabetic in patients who were phakic at baseline. Among these patients, 80% of ILUVIEN subjects vs. 27% of sham-controlled subjects underwent cataract surgery. 2 235 of the 375 ILUVIEN subjects were phakic at baseline; 121 of 185 sham-controlled subjects were phakic at baseline.

The incidence of cataract development in patients who had a phakic study eye was higher in the ILUVIEN group ( 82% ) compared with Sham ( 50% ) . The median time of cataract being reported as an adverse event was approximately 12 months in the ILUVIEN group and 19 months in the Sham group. Among these patients, 80% of ILUVIEN subjects vs. 27% of sham-controlled subjects underwent cataract surgery, generally within the first 18 months ( Median Month 15 for both ILUVIEN group and for Sham ) of the studies. Chronic Non-Infectious Uveitis Affecting the Posterior Segment of the Eye Studies 1 and 2 were multicenter, randomized, sham injection-controlled, double-masked trials in which patients with non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye were treated once with either fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant or sham injection, and then received standard care for the duration of the study. Study 3 was a multicenter, randomized, masked trial in which patients with non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye were all treated once with fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant, administered by one of two different applicators, and then received standard care for the duration of the study. Table 3 summarizes data available from studies 1, 2 and 3 through 12 months for study eyes treated with fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant ( n=226 ) or sham injection ( n=94 ) . The most common ocular ( study eye ) and non-ocular adverse reactions in patients with non-infectious uveitis are shown in Table 3 and Table 4 . Table 3: Ocular Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 1% of Subject Eyes and Non-Ocular Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 2% of Patients with Non-Infectious Uveitis 1 Includes cataract, cataract subcapsular and lenticular opacities in study eyes that were phakic at baseline. 113 of the 226 fluocinolone acetonide study eyes were phakic at baseline; 56 of 94 sham-controlled study eyes were phakic at baseline.

These reactions include reports of drug administration error and reports of the drug being ineffective.",
