( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5  WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use caution when administering EPYSQLI to patients with any other systemic infection. ( 5.3 ) Infusion-Related Reactions: Monitor patients during infusion, interrupt for reactions, and institute appropriate supportive measures. ( 5.6 ) 5.1  Serious Meningococcal Infections Eculizumab products, complement inhibitors, increase a patient's susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by meningococcal bacteria (septicemia and/or meningitis) in any serogroup, including non-groupable strains. Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. . The initiation of EPYSQLI treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection. Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A, C, W, Y, and B) at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of EPYSQLI, according to current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations, considering the duration of  therapy with EPYSQLI. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent EPYSQLI therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer meningococcal vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including eculizumab products. The benefits and risks of treatment with EPYSQLI, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis . Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious meningococcal infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life- threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of EPYSQLI in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection, depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated. EPYSQLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] 5.2  EPYSQLI REMS EPYSQLI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called EPYSQLI REMS, because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )] Notable requirements of the EPYSQLI REMS include the following: Prescribers must enroll in the REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Prescribers must provide the patients with the REMS educational materials. Prescribers must assess patient vaccination status for meningococcal vaccines (against serogroups A, C, W, Y and B) and vaccinate if needed according to current ACIP recommendations two weeks prior to the first dose of EPYSQLI. Prescribers must provide a prescription for antibacterial drug prophylaxis if treatment must be started urgently and the patient is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to current ACIP recommendations at least two weeks prior to the first dose of EPYSQLI. Healthcare settings and pharmacies that dispense EPYSQLI must be certified in the REMS and must verify prescribers are certified. Patients must receive counseling from the prescriber about the need to receive meningococcal vaccines per ACIP recommendations, the need to take antibiotics as directed by the prescriber,  and the signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with EPYSQLI. Further information is available at www.EPYSQLIREMS.com or 1-866-318-0342. 5.3  Other Infections Serious infections with Neisseria species (other than Neisseria meningitidis ), including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. Eculizumab products block terminal complement activation; therefore, patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria, such as infections with Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and to a lesser extent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Additionally, Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Children treated with eculizumab products may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP recommendations. Patients receiving eculizumab products are at increased risk for infections due to these organisms, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. 5.4 Monitoring Disease Manifestations after EPYSQLI Discontinuation Treatment Discontinuation for PNH Monitor patients after discontinuing EPYSQLI for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis. Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS After discontinuing EPYSQLI, monitor patients with aHUS for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) complications for at least 12 weeks. In aHUS clinical trials, 18 patients (5 in the prospective studies) discontinued eculizumab treatment. TMA complications occurred following a missed dose in 5 patients, and eculizumab was reinitiated in 4 of these 5 patients. Clinical signs and symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status, seizures, angina, dyspnea, or thrombosis. In addition, the following changes in laboratory parameters may identify a TMA complication: occurrence of two, or repeated measurement of any one of the following: a decrease in platelet count by 25% or more compared to baseline or the peak platelet count during EPYSQLI treatment; an increase in serum creatinine by 25% or more compared to baseline or nadir during EPYSQLI treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH by 25% or more over baseline or nadir during EPYSQLI treatment. If TMA complications occur after EPYSQLI discontinuation, consider reinstitution of EPYSQLI treatment, plasma therapy [plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or fresh frozen plasma infusion (PE/PI)], or appropriate organ-specific supportive measures. 5.5 Thrombosis Prevention and Management The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during eculizumab products treatment has not been established. Therefore, treatment with eculizumab products should not alter anticoagulant management. 5.6 Infusion-Related Reactions Administration of eculizumab products may result in infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical trials, no patients experienced an infusion-related reaction which required discontinuation of eculizumab.

Meningococcal infections are the most important adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving eculizumab. In PNH clinical studies, two patients experienced meningococcal sepsis. Both patients had previously received a meningococcal vaccine. In clinical studies among patients without PNH, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient. Meningococcal sepsis occurred in one previously vaccinated patient enrolled in the retrospective aHUS study during the post-study follow-up period [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.1 ) PNH The data described below reflect exposure to eculizumab in 196 adult patients with PNH, age 18-85, of whom 55% were female. All had signs or symptoms of intravascular hemolysis. Eculizumab was studied in a placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1, in which 43 patients received eculizumab and 44, placebo); a single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2); and a long term extension study (E05-001). 182 patients were exposed for greater than one year. All patients received the recommended eculizumab dose regimen. Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a numerically higher rate in the eculizumab group than the placebo group and at a rate of 5% or more among patients treated with eculizumab.

The serious reactions included infections and progression of PNH. No deaths occurred in the study and no patients receiving eculizumab experienced a thrombotic event; one thrombotic event occurred in a patient receiving placebo. Among 193 patients with PNH treated with eculizumab in the single arm, clinical study or the follow-up study, the adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical study. Serious adverse reactions occurred among 16% of the patients in these studies. The most common serious adverse reactions were: viral infection (2%), headache (2%), anemia (2%), and pyrexia (2%). aHUS The safety of eculizumab therapy in patients with aHUS was evaluated in four prospective, single-arm studies, three in adult and adolescent patients (Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B, and C10-004), one in pediatric and adolescent patients (Study C10-003), and one retrospective study (Study C09-001r). The data described below were derived from 78 adult and adolescent patients with aHUS in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004. All patients received the recommended dosage of eculizumab. Median exposure was 67 weeks (range: 2-145 weeks). Table 5 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004 combined.

The most commonly reported SAEs were infections (24%), hypertension (5%), chronic renal failure (5%), and renal impairment (5%). Five patients discontinued eculizumab due to adverse events; three due to worsening renal function, one due to new diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and one due to meningococcal meningitis. Study C10-003 included 22 pediatric and adolescent patients, of which 18 patients were less than 12 years of age. All patients received the recommended dosage of eculizumab. Median exposure was 44 weeks (range: 1 dose-87 weeks). Table 6 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients enrolled in Study C10-003.

The most commonly reported SAEs were hypertension (9%), viral gastroenteritis (9%), pyrexia (9%), and upper respiratory infection (9%). One patient discontinued eculizumab due to an adverse event (severe agitation). Analysis of retrospectively collected adverse event data from pediatric and adult patients enrolled in Study C09-001r (N=30) revealed a safety profile that was similar to that which was observed in the two prospective studies. Study C09-001r included 19 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. Overall, the safety of eculizumab in pediatric patients with aHUS enrolled in Study C09-001r appeared similar to that observed in adult patients. The most common (\u226515%) adverse events occurring in pediatric patients are presented in Table 7 .

Patients were 19 to 79 years of age, and 66% were female. Table 8 displays the most common adverse reactions from gMG Study 1 that occurred in \u22655% of eculizumab-treated patients and at a greater frequency than on placebo.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to eculizumab products exposure. Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports Fatal or serious infections: Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Neisseria meningitidis , Neisseria sicca/subflava , Neisseria spp unspecified. Cases of cholestatic or mixed pattern liver injury with increased serum liver enzymes and bilirubin levels have been reported in adult and pediatric patients with aHUS who were treated with eculizumab products. These events occurred within 3 to 27 days after starting treatment. The median time to resolution (or return to baseline) was approximately 3 weeks.",
