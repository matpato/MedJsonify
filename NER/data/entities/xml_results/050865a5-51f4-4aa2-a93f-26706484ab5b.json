The histological diagnosis of superficial basal cell carcinoma should be established prior to treatment, since safety and efficacy of Imiquimod Cream have not been established for other types of basal cell carcinomas, including nodular and morpheaform (fibrosing or sclerosing) types. 1.3 External Genital Warts Imiquimod Cream is indicated for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts/condyloma acuminata in patients 12 years old and older. 1.4 Limitations of Use Imiquimod cream has been evaluated in children ages 2 to 12 years with molluscum contagiosum and these studies failed to demonstrate efficacy. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 1.5 Unevaluated Populations The safety and efficacy of Imiquimod Cream in immunosuppressed patients have not been established. Imiquimod Cream should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions.

Dosing interruption may be required ( 2 , 5.1 , 6 ) \u2022 Severe local inflammatory reactions of the female external genitalia can lead to severe vulvar swelling. Severe vulvar swelling can lead to urinary retention; dosing should be interrupted or discontinued. \u2022 Flu-like systemic signs and symptoms including malaise, fever, nausea, myalgias and rigors may occur. Dosing interruption may be required ( 2 , 5.2 , 6 ) \u2022 Avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps. Wear sunscreen daily ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Safety and efficacy have not been established for repeat courses of treatment to the same area for AK ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Imiquimod Cream is not recommended for treatment of BCC subtypes other than the superficial variant, i.e., sBCC ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Treatment of urethral, intra-vaginal, cervical, rectal or intra-anal viral disease is not recommended ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Safety and efficacy in immunosuppressed patients have not been established ( 1.5 ) 5.1 Local Inflammatory Reactions Intense local inflammatory reactions including skin weeping or erosion can occur after a few applications of Imiquimod Cream and may require an interruption of dosing. [see Dosage and Administration ( . Imiquimod Cream has the potential to exacerbate inflammatory conditions of the skin, including chronic graft versus host disease. 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] Severe local inflammatory reactions of the female external genitalia can lead to severe vulvar swelling. Severe vulvar swelling can lead to urinary retention. Dosing should be interrupted or discontinued for severe vulvar swelling. Administration of Imiquimod Cream is not recommended until the skin is completely healed from any previous drug or surgical treatment. 5.2 Systemic Reactions Flu-like signs and symptoms may accompany, or even precede, local inflammatory reactions and may include malaise, fever, nausea, myalgias and rigors. An interruption of dosing should be considered. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] 5.3 Ultraviolet Light Exposure Exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided or minimized during use of Imiquimod Cream because of concern for heightened sunburn susceptibility. Patients should be warned to use protective clothing (e.g., a hat) when using Imiquimod Cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use Imiquimod Cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure, e.g. due to their occupation, and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise caution when using Imiquimod Cream. Imiquimod Cream shortened the time to skin tumor formation in an animal photo-cocarcinogenecity study [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( The enhancement of ultraviolet carcinogenicity is not necessarily dependent on phototoxic mechanisms. Therefore, patients should minimize or avoid natural or artificial sunlight exposure. 13.1 )]. 5.4 Unevaluated Uses: Actinic Keratosis Safety and efficacy have not been established for Imiquimod Cream in the treatment of actinic keratosis with repeated use, i.e. more than one treatment course, in the same area. The safety of Imiquimod Cream applied to areas of skin greater than 25 cm 2 (e.g. 5 cm X 5 cm) for the treatment of actinic keratosis has not been established [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.5 Unevaluated Uses: Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma The safety and efficacy of Imiquimod Cream have not been established for other types of basal cell carcinomas (BCC), including nodular and morpheaform (fibrosing or sclerosing) types. Imiquimod Cream is not recommended for treatment of BCC subtypes other than the superficial variant (i.e., sBCC). Patients with sBCC treated with Imiquimod Cream should have regular follow-up of the treatment site. [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. The safety and efficacy of treating sBCC lesions on the face, head and anogenital area have not been established. 5.6 Unevaluated Uses: External Genital Warts Imiquimod Cream has not been evaluated for the treatment of urethral, intra-vaginal, cervical, rectal, or intra-anal human papilloma viral disease.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence >28%) are application site reactions or local skin reactions: itching, burning, erythema, flaking/scaling/dryness, scabbing/crusting, edema, induration, excoriation, erosion, ulceration. Other reported reactions (1%) include fatigue, fever, and headache ( 6.1 , 6.2 , 6.3 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience: Actinic Keratosis The data described below reflect exposure to imiquimod cream or vehicle in 436 subjects enrolled in two double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies. Subjects applied imiquimod cream or vehicle to a 25 cm 2 contiguous treatment area on the face or scalp 2 times per week for 16 weeks.

Overall, in the clinical studies, 2% (5/215) of subjects discontinued for local skin/application site reactions. Of the 215 subjects treated, 35 subjects (16%) on imiquimod cream and 3 of 220 subjects (1%) on vehicle cream had at least one rest period. Of these imiquimod cream subjects, 32 (91%) resumed therapy after a rest period. In the AK studies, 22 of 678 (3.2%) of imiquimod-treated subjects developed treatment site infections that required a rest period off imiquimod cream and were treated with antibiotics (19 with oral and 3 with topical). Of the 206 imiquimod subjects with both baseline and 8-week post-treatment scarring assessments, 6 (2.9%) had a greater degree of scarring scores at 8-weeks post-treatment than at baseline. 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience: Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma The data described below reflect exposure to imiquimod cream or vehicle in 364 subjects enrolled in two double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies. Subjects applied imiquimod cream or vehicle 5 times per week for 6 weeks. The incidence of adverse reactions reported by > 1% of subjects during the studies is summarized below.

The average number of doses not received per subject due to rest periods was 7 doses with a range of 2 to 22 doses; 79% of subjects (15/19) resumed therapy after a rest period. Overall, in the clinical studies, 2% (4/185) of subjects discontinued for local skin/application site reactions. In the sBCC studies, 17 of 1266 (1.3%) imiquimod treated subjects developed treatment site infections that required a rest period and treatment with antibiotics. 6.3 Clinical Trials Experience: External Genital Warts In controlled clinical trials for genital warts, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were local skin and application site reactions. Some subjects also reported systemic reactions. Overall, 1.2% (4/327) of the subjects discontinued due to local skin/application site reactions. The incidence and severity of local skin reactions during controlled clinical trials are shown in the following table.
