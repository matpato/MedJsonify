( 5.11 ) Seizures: Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. ( 5.12 ) 5.1\tIncreased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. ERZOFRI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see . Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] 5.2\tCerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks) including fatalities compared to placebo-treated subjects. No studies have been conducted with oral paliperidone, 1-month or 3-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspensions, or ERZOFRI, in elderly patients with dementia. ERZOFRI is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see . Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 5.3\tNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs, including paliperidone. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue ERZOFRI and provide symptomatic treatment and monitoring. 5.4\tQT Prolongation Paliperidone causes a modest increase in the corrected QT (QTc) interval. The use of paliperidone should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Paliperidone should also be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of Torsades de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. The effects of oral paliperidone on the QT interval were evaluated in a double-blind, active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg single dose), multicenter QT study in adults with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, and in three placebo- and active-controlled 6-week, fixed-dose efficacy trials in adults with schizophrenia. In the QT study (n=141) of oral paliperidone, the 8 mg dose of immediate-release oral paliperidone (n=50) showed a mean placebo-subtracted increase from baseline in QTcLD (QT interval corrected for heart rate using the population specified linear derived method) of 12.3 msec (90% CI: 8.9; 15.6) on Day 8 at 1.5 hours post-dose. The mean steady-state peak plasma concentration for this 8 mg oral dose of immediate release paliperidone (C max ss = 113 ng/mL) was more than 2-fold the exposure observed with the maximum recommended 234 mg maintenance dose of another once-a-month paliperidone extended-release injectable suspension administered in the deltoid muscle (predicted median C max-ss = 50 ng/mL). In this same study, a 4 mg dose of the immediate-release oral formulation of paliperidone, for which C max-ss = 35 ng/mL, showed an increased placebo-subtracted QTcLD of 6.8 msec (90% CI: 3.6; 10.1) on Day 2 at 1.5 hours post-dose. In the three fixed-dose efficacy studies of oral paliperidone extended release in subjects with schizophrenia, electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements taken at various time points showed only one subject in the oral paliperidone 12 mg group had a change exceeding 60 msec at one time- point on Day 6 (increase of 62 msec). In the four fixed-dose efficacy studies of another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension in subjects with schizophrenia and in the long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, no subject experienced a change in QTcLD exceeding 60 msec and no subject had a QTcLD value of > 500 msec at any time point. In the maintenance study in subjects with schizophrenia, no subject had a QTcLD change > 60 msec, and one subject had a QTcLD value of 507 msec (Bazett's QT corrected interval [QTcB] value of 483 msec); this latter subject also had a heart rate of 45 beats per minute. 5.5\tTardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible appear to increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and may thus mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, ERZOFRI should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ERZOFRI, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with ERZOFRI despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.6\tMetabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, have been reported in patients treated with all atypical antipsychotics. These cases were, for the most part, seen in post-marketing clinical use and epidemiologic studies, not in clinical trials. Hyperglycemia and diabetes have been reported in trial subjects treated with another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (also referred to as \"PP1M\" in this section). Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. Pooled data from the four placebo-controlled (one 9-week and three 13-week), fixed-dose studies of another PP1M in subjects with schizophrenia are presented in Table 4.

During the initial 25-week open-label period of a long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, another PP1M was associated with mean change in glucose of +5.3 mg/dL (n=518). At the endpoint of the subsequent 15-month double-blind period of the study, the PP1M was associated with a mean change in glucose of +0.3 mg/dL (n=131) compared with a mean change of +4.0 mg/dL in the placebo group (n=120). Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.

During the initial 25-week open-label period of a long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, another PP1M was associated with a mean change in weight of +2.2 kg and 18.4% of subjects had an increase in body weight of \u2265 7% (n=653). At the endpoint of the subsequent 15-month double-blind period of the study, the PP1M was associated with a mean change in weight of -0.2 kg and 13.0% of subjects had an increase in body weight of \u2265 7% (n=161); the placebo group had a mean change in weight of -0.8 kg and 6.0% of subjects had an increase in body weight of \u2265 7% (n=168). 5.7\tOrthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Paliperidone can induce orthostatic hypotension and syncope in some patients because of its alpha- adrenergic blocking activity. Syncope was reported in < 1% (4/1293) of subjects treated with another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (PP1M) in the recommended maintenance dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg in the four fixed- dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials compared with 0% (0/510) of subjects treated with placebo. In the four fixed-dose efficacy studies in subjects with schizophrenia, orthostatic hypotension was reported as an adverse event by < 1% (2/1293) of the PP1M-treated subjects compared to 0% (0/510) with placebo. Incidences of orthostatic hypotension and syncope in the long-term studies in subjects with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were similar to those observed in the short-term studies. Use ERZOFRI with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions that predispose the patient to hypotension (e.g., dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in patients who are vulnerable to hypotension. 5.8\tFalls Somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability have been reported with the use of antipsychotics, including paliperidone palmitate, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. For patients, particularly the elderly, with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, assess the risk of falls when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.9\tLeukopenia, Neutropenia, and Agranulocytosis In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (PP1M). Agranulocytosis has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC)/absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. In patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC/ANC or a drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia, perform a complete blood count (CBC) frequently during the first few months of therapy. In such patients, consider discontinuation of ERZOFRI at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Monitor patients with clinically significant neutropenia for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treat promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Discontinue ERZOFRI in patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 ) and follow their WBC until recovery. 5.10\tHyperprolactinemia Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D 2 receptors, paliperidone elevates prolactin levels and the elevation persists during chronic administration. Paliperidone has a prolactin-elevating effect similar to that seen with risperidone, a drug that is associated with higher levels of prolactin than other antipsychotic drugs. Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. An increase in the incidence of pituitary gland, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in the risperidone carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see . Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive. Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] Prolactin data from two long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with another PP1M are presented below; one study was in a population of patients with schizophrenia; the second study was in patients with schizoaffective disorder. Schizophrenia In a long-term maintenance trial of another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (PP1M) in schizophrenia patients (Study 5) [see , elevations of prolactin to above the reference range (> 18 ng/mL in males and > 30 ng/mL in females) relative to open-label baseline at any time during the double- blind phase were noted in a higher percentage of the patients in the PP1M group than those in the placebo group in males (51.9% versus 29.0%) and in females (50.5% versus 42.9%). During the double-blind phase, 4 females (4.2%) in the PP1M group experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (amenorrhea N=2; galactorrhea N=1; menstruation irregular N=1), while 2 females (2.2%) in the placebo group experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (amenorrhea N=1; breast pain N=1). One male (0.9%) in the PP1M group experienced erectile dysfunction and 1 male (0.9%) in placebo group experienced gynecomastia. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Prior to the double-blind phase (during the 33-week open-label phase of the long-term maintenance trial), the mean (SD) serum prolactin values at baseline were 14.9 (22.3) ng/mL in males (N=490) and 35.2 (39.6) ng/mL in females (N=358). At the end of the open-label phase, mean (SD) prolactin values were 24.7 (22.5) ng/mL in males (N=470) and 59.5 (38.1) ng/mL in females (N=333). During the open-label phases 49.2% of females and 47.7% of males experienced elevations of prolactin above the reference range relative to baseline, and a higher proportion of females experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions compared to males (5.3% versus 1.8%). Amenorrhea (2.5%) in females and no single potentially prolactin-related adverse reaction in males were observed with a rate greater than 2%. Schizoaffective Disorder In a long-term maintenance trial of another PP1M in patients with schizoaffective disorder (Study SCA-3004) see , elevations of prolactin to above the reference range (> 13.13 ng/mL in males and > 26.72 ng/mL in females) relative to open-label baseline at any time during the 15-month double-blind phase were noted in a higher percentage of patients in the PP1M group than those in the placebo group in males (55.6% versus 23.2%) and in females (44.3% versus 25.0%). During the 15-month double-blind phase, 11 females (13.9%) in the PP1M group had 14 potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (hyperprolactinemia N=3; blood prolactin increased N=4; libido decreased N=1; amenorrhea N=3; galactorrhea N=3), while 5 females (5.8%) in the placebo group had 6 potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (hyperprolactinemia N=2; blood prolactin increased N=1; amenorrhea N=2; galactorrhea N=1). Six males (7.1%) in the PP1M group experienced 6 potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions (hyperprolactinemia N=4; libido decreased N=1; erectile dysfunction N=1), while 1 male (1.2%) in the placebo group experienced adverse reaction of blood prolactin increased. Clinical Studies (14.2) Prior to the 15-month double-blind phase (during the 25-week open-label phase of the long-term maintenance trial), the mean (SD) serum prolactin values at baseline were 14.6 (14.0) ng/mL in males (N=352) and 39.1 (44.6) ng/mL in females (N=302). At the end of the open-label phase, mean (SD) prolactin values were 32.8 (17.2) ng/mL in males (N=275) and 72.4 (46.5) ng/mL in females (N=239). During the open-label phase, 48.9% of females and 53.3% of males experienced elevations of prolactin above the reference range relative to baseline, and a higher proportion of females experienced potentially prolactin-related adverse reactions compared to males (10.0% versus 9.0%). Amenorrhea (5.8%) and galactorrhea (2.9%) in females and libido decrease (2.8%) and erectile dysfunction (2.5%) in males were observed with a rate greater than 2%. 5.11\tPotential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence, sedation, and dizziness were reported as adverse reactions in subjects treated with another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (PP1M) [see . Antipsychotics, including ERZOFRI, have the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills. Patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating hazardous machinery or operating a motor vehicle, until they are reasonably certain that paliperidone therapy does not adversely affect them. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.12\tSeizures In the four fixed-dose double-blind placebo-controlled studies in subjects with schizophrenia, <1% (1 out of1,293) of subjects treated with another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (PP1M) in the recommended dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg experienced a convulsion compared with <1% (1 out of 510) of placebo-treated subjects who experienced a grand mal convulsion. Like other antipsychotic drugs, ERZOFRI should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or other conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older. 5.13\tDysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. ERZOFRI and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration. 5.14\tPriapism Drugs with alpha-adrenergic blocking effects have been reported to induce priapism. Although no cases of priapism have been reported in clinical trials with another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (PP1M), priapism has been reported with oral paliperidone during postmarketing surveillance. Severe priapism may require surgical intervention. 5.15\tDisruption of Body Temperature Regulation Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ERZOFRI to patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.",

The safety of ERZOFRI for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and schizoaffective disorder in adults as monotherapy and as an adjunct to mood stabilizers or antidepressants is based upon adequate and well-controlled studies of another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension (also referred to as \"PP1M\" in this section). Below is a display of adverse reactions with another PP1M from those adequate and well-controlled studies. Injection site reactions for ERZOFRI presented in this section (see \" \" below) are based on pharmacokinetic studies. Pain and Injection Site Reactions with ERZOFRI Patient Exposure The data described in this section are derived from a clinical trial database consisting of a total of 3,817 subjects (approximately 1,705 patient-years exposure) with schizophrenia who received at least one dose of PP1M in the recommended dose range of 39 mg to 234 mg and a total of 510 subjects with schizophrenia who received placebo. Among the 3,817  PP1M-treated subjects, 1,293 received PP1M in four fixed-dose, double- blind, placebo-controlled trials (one 9-week and three 13-week studies), 849 received  PP1M in the maintenance trial (median exposure 229 days during the initial 33-week open-label phase of this study, of whom 205 continued to receive  PP1M  during the double-blind placebo-controlled phase of this study [median exposure 171 days]), and 1,675 received  PP1M in five non-placebo controlled trials (three noninferiority active- comparator trials, one long-term open-label pharmacokinetic and safety study, and an injection site [deltoid-gluteal] cross-over trial). One of the 13-week studies included a 234 mg   PP1M initiation dose followed by treatment with either 39 mg, 156 mg, or 234 mg every 4 weeks. The safety of PP1M was also evaluated in a 15-month, long-term study comparing the other PP1M to selected oral antipsychotic therapies in adult subjects with schizophrenia. A total of 226 subjects received PP1M during the 15-month, open-label period of this study; 218 subjects received selected oral antipsychotic therapies. The safety of PP1M was similar to that seen in previous double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia. The safety of PP1M was also evaluated in a long-term study in adult subjects with schizoaffective disorder. A total of 667 subjects PP1M during the initial 25-week open-label period of this study (median exposure 147 days); 164 subjects continued to receive PP1M during the 15-month double-blind placebo-controlled period of this study (median exposure 446 days). Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently in the PP1M group than the placebo group (a 2% difference or more between groups) were weight increased, nasopharyngitis, headache, hyperprolactinemia, and pyrexia. Adverse Reactions in Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions : The most common (at least 5% in any PP1M group) and likely drug-related (adverse events for which the drug rate is at least twice the placebo rate) adverse reactions from the double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in subjects with schizophrenia were injection site reactions, somnolence/sedation, dizziness, akathisia, and extrapyramidal disorder . No occurrences of adverse events reached this threshold in the long-term double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder. Discontinuation of Treatment Due to Adverse Events : The percentage of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events in the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials were similar for PP1M- and placebo-treated subjects. The percentage of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events in the open-label period of the long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder was 7.5%. During the double-blind, placebo-controlled period of that study, the percentages of subjects who discontinued due to adverse events were 5.5% and 1.8% in PP1M- and placebo-treated subjects, respectively. Dose-Related Adverse Reactions : Based on the pooled data from the four fixed-dose, double- blind, placebo-controlled trials in subjects with schizophrenia, among the adverse reactions that occurred with \u2265 2% incidence in the subjects treated with PP1M, only akathisia increased with dose. Hyperprolactinemia also exhibited a dose relationship, but did not occur at \u2265 2% incidence in PP1M-treated subjects from the four fixed-dose studies. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in a once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension-Treated Patients: Table 9 lists the adverse reactions reported in 2% or more of PP1M -treated subjects and at a greater proportion than in the placebo group with schizophrenia in the four fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.

Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) Pooled data from the two double-blind, placebo-controlled, 13-week, fixed-dose trials in adult subjects with schizophrenia provided information regarding EPS. Several methods were used to measure EPS: (1) the Simpson-Angus global score which broadly evaluates parkinsonism, (2) the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale global clinical rating score which evaluates akathisia, (3) the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale scores which evaluates dyskinesia, and (4) use of anticholinergic medications to treat EPS (Table 10), and (5) incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS (Table 11).

In the 9-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the proportions of parkinsonism and akathisia assessed by incidence of rating scales were higher in the PP1M 156 mg group (18% and 11%, respectively) than in the PP1M 78 mg group (9% and 5%, respectively) and placebo group (7% and 4%, respectively). In the 13-week study in subjects with schizophrenia involving 234 mg initiation dosing, the incidence of any EPS was similar to that of the placebo group (8%), but exhibited a dose-related pattern with 6%, 10%, and 11% in the PP1M 234/39 mg, 234/156 mg, and 234/234 mg groups, respectively. Hyperkinesia was the most frequent category of EPS-related adverse events in this study, and was reported at a similar rate between the placebo (4.9%) and PP1M 234/156 mg (4.8%) and 234/234 mg (5.5%) groups, but at a lower rate in the 234/39 mg group (1.3%). In the long-term study in subjects with schizoaffective disorder, EPS reported during the 25-week open-label PP1M treatment included hyperkinesia (12.3%), parkinsonism (8.7%), tremor (3.4%), dyskinesia (2.5%), and dystonia (2.1%). During the 15-month double-blind treatment, the incidence of any EPS was similar to that of the placebo group (8.5% and 7.1% respectively). The most commonly reported treatment-emergent EPS-related adverse events (> 2%) in any treatment group in the double-blind phase of the study (PP1M versus placebo) were hyperkinesia (3.7% versus 2.9%), parkinsonism (3.0% versus 1.8%), and tremor (1.2% versus 2.4%). Dystonia Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Pain Assessment and Injection Site Reactions In the pooled data from the two 13-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of another  PP1M in subjects with schizophrenia, the mean intensity of injection pain reported by subjects using a visual analog scale (0 = no pain to 100 = unbearably painful) decreased in all treatment groups from the first to the last injection (placebo: 10.9 to 9.8; 39 mg: 10.3 to 7.7; 78 mg: 10.0 to 9.2; 156 mg: 11.1 to 8.8). The results from both the 9-week, fixed-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and the double-blind phase of the maintenance trial exhibited comparable findings. In the 13-week study involving 234 mg initiation dosing in subjects with schizophrenia, occurrences of induration, redness, or swelling, as assessed by blinded study personnel, were infrequent, generally mild, decreased over time, and similar in incidence between the PP1M and placebo groups. Investigator ratings of injection pain were similar for the placebo and PP1M groups. Investigator evaluations of the injection site after the first injection for redness, swelling, induration, and pain were rated as absent for 69-100% of subjects in both the PP1M and placebo groups. At Day 92, investigators rated absence of redness, swelling, induration, and pain in 95-100% of subjects in both the PP1M and placebo groups. ERZOFRI was evaluated in 281 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in an open-label randomized parallel arm study. The percentage of patients in the open-label study reporting injection site-related adverse reactions at the first injection for patients treated with ERZOFRI (all reported as injection site pain) was similar to the percentage of patients treated with another PP1M. Additional Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials with Oral Paliperidone The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported in clinical trials with oral paliperidone: Cardiac disorders : bundle branch block left, sinus arrhythmia Gastrointestinal disorders : abdominal pain, small intestinal obstruction General disorders and administration site conditions : edema, edema peripheral Immune system disorders : anaphylactic reaction Infections and infestations: rhinitis Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : musculoskeletal pain, torticollis, trismus Nervous system disorders : grand mal convulsion, parkinsonian gait, transient ischemic attack Psychiatric disorders: sleep disorder Reproductive system and breast disorders : breast engorgement Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pharyngolaryngeal pain, pneumonia aspiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: rash papular Vascular disorders: hypotension, ischemia 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of paliperidone; because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: angioedema, catatonia, ileus, somnambulism, swollen tongue, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, urinary incontinence, and urinary retention. Cases of anaphylactic reaction after injection with another once-a-month paliperidone palmitate extended-release injectable suspension product have been reported during postmarketing experience in patients who have previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral paliperidone. Paliperidone is the major active metabolite of risperidone. Adverse reactions reported with oral risperidone and risperidone long-acting injection can be found in the Adverse Reactions (6) sections of the package inserts for those products.",
