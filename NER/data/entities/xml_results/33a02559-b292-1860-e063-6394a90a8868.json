    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity accompanied by severe rash or systemic allergic reaction, including potentially life- threatening events, has been reported. Hepatic laboratory parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubinshould be obtained prior to starting Maraviroc and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated. If rash or symptoms or signs of hepatitis or allergic reaction develop, hepatic laboratory parameters should be monitored and discontinuation of treatment should be considered. When administering Maraviroc to patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction or who are co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus, additional monitoring may be warranted. ( 5.1 ) Severe and potentially life-threatening skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking Maraviroc. This includes cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hypersensitivity reaction, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Immediately discontinue Maraviroc and other suspected agents if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop and monitor clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, closely. ( 5.2 ) More cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, were observed in treatment-experienced subjects who received Maraviroc. Additional monitoring may be warranted. ( 5.3 ) If patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD receiving Maraviroc (without concomitant CYP3A inducers or inhibitors) experience postural hypotension, the dose of Maraviroc should be reduced from 300 mg twice daily to 150 mg twice daily. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity with allergic features including life-threatening events has been reported in clinical trials and postmarketing. Severe rash or evidence of systemic allergic reaction including drug-related rash with fever, eosinophilia, elevated IgE, or other systemic symptoms have been reported in conjunction with hepatotoxicity [see . These events occurred approximately 1 month after starting treatment. Among reported cases of hepatitis, some were observed in the absence of allergic features or with no pre-existing hepatic disease. Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Appropriate laboratory testing including ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with Maraviroc and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated. Hepatic laboratory parameters should be obtained in any patient who develops rash, or signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or allergic reaction. Discontinuation of Maraviroc should be considered in any patient with signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or with increased liver transaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms. When administering Maraviroc to patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction or who are co-infected with hepatitis B and/or C virus, additional monitoring may be warranted. The safety and efficacy of Maraviroc have not been specifically studied in patients with significant underlying liver disorders. 5.2 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, potentially life-threatening skin and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients taking Maraviroc, in most cases concomitantly with other drugs associated with these reactions. These include cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) [see . The cases were characterized by features including rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure. Discontinue Maraviroc and other suspected agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, malaise, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, lip swelling, eosinophilia). Delay in stopping treatment with Maraviroc or other suspect drugs after the onset of rash may result in a life-threatening reaction. Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.3 Cardiovascular Events Eleven subjects (1.3%) who received Maraviroc had cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, during the Phase 3 trials in treatment\u2011experienced subjects (total exposure 609 patient\u2011years [300 on Maraviroc once daily + 309 on Maraviroc twice daily]), while no subjects who received placebo had such events (total exposure 111 patient\u2011years).\u00a0These subjects generally had cardiac disease or cardiac risk factors prior to use of Maraviroc, and the relative contribution of Maraviroc to these events is not known. In the Phase 2b/3 trial in treatment\u2011naive adult subjects, 3 subjects (0.8%) who received Maraviroc had events related to ischemic heart disease and 5 subjects (1.4%) who received efavirenz had such events (total exposure 506 and 508 patient\u2011years for Maraviroc and efavirenz, respectively). When Maraviroc was administered to healthy volunteers at doses higher than the recommended dose, symptomatic postural hypotension was seen at a greater frequency than in placebo. However, when Maraviroc was given at the recommended dose in HIV-1\u2013infected adult subjects in Phase 3 trials, postural hypotension was seen at a rate similar to placebo (approximately 0.5%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, risk factors for postural hypotension, or receiving concomitant medication known to lower blood pressure, could be at increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events triggered by postural hypotension. Additional monitoring may be warranted. Postural Hypotension in Patients with Renal Impairment An increased risk of postural hypotension may occur in patients with severe renal insufficiency or in those with ESRD due to increased maraviroc exposure in some patients. Maraviroc should be used in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD only if they are not receiving a concomitant potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer. However, the use of Maraviroc in these patients should only be considered when no alternative treatment options are available. If adult patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking 300 mg twice daily, the dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice daily [see . Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] 5.4 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including Maraviroc. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection with Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], tuberculosis, or reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster ), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.5 Potential Risk of Infection Maraviroc antagonizes the CCR5 co-receptor located on some immune cells, and therefore could potentially increase the risk of developing infections. The overall incidence and severity of infection, as well as AIDS-defining category C infections, were comparable in the treatment groups during the Phase 3 adult treatment\u2011experienced trials of Maraviroc. While there was a higher rate of certain upper respiratory tract infections reported in the treatment arm receiving Maraviroc compared with placebo (23% versus 13%), there was a lower rate of pneumonia (2% versus 5%) reported in subjects receiving Maraviroc. A higher incidence of Herpes virus infections (11 per 100 patient\u2011years) was also reported in the treatment arm receiving Maraviroc when adjusted for exposure compared with placebo (8 per 100 patient\u2011years). In the Phase 2b/3 trial in treatment\u2011naive adult subjects, the incidence of AIDS-defining Category C events when adjusted for exposure was 1.8 for Maraviroc compared with 2.4 for efavirenz per 100 patient\u2011years of exposure. Patients should be monitored closely for evidence of infections while receiving Maraviroc. 5.6 Potential Risk of Malignancy While no increase in malignancy has been observed with Maraviroc, due to this drug\u2019s mechanism of action, it could affect immune surveillance and lead to an increased risk of malignancy. The exposure-adjusted rate for malignancies per 100 patient\u2011years of exposure in adult treatment\u2011experienced trials was 4.6 for Maraviroc compared with 9.3 on placebo. In treatment\u2011naive adult subjects, the rates were 1.0 and 2.4 per 100 patient\u2011years of exposure for Maraviroc and efavirenz, respectively. Long-term follow-up is needed to more fully assess this risk.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Cardiovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse events in treatment-experienced adult subjects (greater than 8% incidence) which occurred at a higher frequency compared with placebo are upper respiratory tract infections, cough, pyrexia, rash, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) The most common adverse events in treatment-naive adult subjects (greater than 8% incidence) which occurred at a higher frequency than the comparator arm are upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, flatulence, bloating and distention, upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms, and gastrointestinal atonic and hypomotility disorders. ( 6.1 ) The most common adverse reactions in treatment-experienced pediatric subjects (greater than or equal to 3% incidence) are vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and dizziness.\u00a0( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact\u00a0A2A Integrated Pharmaceuticals at\u00a01-800-380-6709 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects Treatment\u2011Experienced Subjects: The safety profile of Maraviroc is primarily based on 840 HIV-1infected subjects who received at least 1 dose of Maraviroc during two Phase 3 trials. A total of 426 of these subjects received the indicated twice\u2011daily dosing regimen. Assessment of treatment\u2011emergent adverse events is based on the pooled data from 2 trials in subjects with CCR5-tropic HIV\u20111 (A4001027 and A4001028). The median duration of therapy with Maraviroc for subjects in these trials was 48 weeks, with the total exposure on Maraviroc twice daily at 309 patient\u2011years versus 111 patient\u2011years on placebo each administered with optimized background therapy (OBT). The population was 89% male and 84% white, with mean age of 46 years (range: 17 to 75 years). Subjects received dose equivalents of 300 mg maraviroc once or twice daily. The most common adverse events reported with twice\u2011daily therapy with Maraviroc with frequency rates higher than placebo, regardless of causality, were upper respiratory tract infections, cough, pyrexia, rash, and dizziness. In these 2 trials, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 5% for subjects who received Maraviroc twice daily + OBT as well as those who received placebo + OBT. Most of the adverse events reported were judged to be mild to moderate in severity. The data described below occurred with twice\u2011daily dosing of Maraviroc. The total numbers of subjects reporting infections were 233 (55%) and 84 (40%) in the group receiving Maraviroc twice daily and the placebo group, respectively. Correcting for the longer duration of exposure on Maraviroc compared with placebo, the exposure\u2011adjusted frequency (rate per 100 subject\u2011years) of these events was 133 for both Maraviroc twice daily and placebo. Dizziness or postural dizziness occurred in 8% of subjects on either Maraviroc or placebo, with 2 subjects (0.5%) on Maraviroc permanently discontinuing therapy (1 due to syncope, 1 due to orthostatic hypotension) versus 1 subject on placebo (0.5%) permanently discontinuing therapy due to dizziness. Treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of causality, from Trials A4001027 and A4001028 are summarized in Table 5. Selected events occurring at greater than or equal to 2% of subjects and at a numerically higher rate in subjects treated with Maraviroc are included; events that occurred at the same or higher rate on placebo are not displayed.

Less Common Adverse Events in Clinical Trials: The following adverse events occurred in less than 2% of subjects treated with Maraviroc or at a rate similar to the comparator. These events have been included because of their seriousness and either increased frequency on Maraviroc or are potential risks due to the mechanism of action. Events attributed to the subjects underlying HIV-1 infection are not listed. Blood and Lymphatic System: Marrow depression and hypoplastic anemia. Cardiac Disorders: Unstable angina, acute cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, coronary artery occlusion, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia.

Nervous System Disorders: Cerebrovascular accident, convulsions and epilepsy, tremor (excluding congenital), facial palsy, hemianopia, loss of consciousness, visual field defect. Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects HIV-1Infected Pediatric Subjects: Trial A4001031 is an open-label trial in which 103 treatment-experienced, CCR5-tropic, HIV-1infected pediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years weighing at least 10 kg received Maraviroc twice daily in combination with OBT. The dose of Maraviroc was based on body surface area (BSA) and on whether the subject was receiving potent CYP3A inhibitors and/or inducers. The median duration of therapy with Maraviroc was 131 weeks with 72% of subjects receiving study treatment for greater than 48 weeks and 62% of subjects receiving study treatment for 96 weeks. In these 103 children and adolescents, the safety profile through 96 weeks was similar to that for adults. Most of the adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate; severe (Grade 3 and 4) adverse reactions occurred in 2% of subjects. The most common adverse reactions (all grades) reported with twice-daily therapy with Maraviroc were vomiting (12%), abdominal pain (4%), diarrhea (4%), nausea (4%), and dizziness (3%). Three subjects (3%) discontinued due to adverse events. Maraviroc-related gastrointestinal adverse events through 48 weeks (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain/cramps) were observed more commonly in subjects who received the Maraviroc oral solution (21%) compared with those who received Maraviroc tablets (16%). Subjects were permitted to change formulations after Week 48. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of Maraviroc. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Stevens\u2011Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).",
