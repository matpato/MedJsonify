Monitor serum electrolytes, fluid status and urine output after vasopressin discontinuation. Some patients may require readministration of vasopressin or administration of desmopressin to correct fluid and electrolyte shifts.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of vasopressin were identified in the literature.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bleeding/lymphatic system disorders: Hemorrhagic shock, decreased platelets, intractable bleeding Cardiac disorders: Right heart failure, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, myocardial ischemia Gastrointestinal disorders: Mesenteric ischemia Hepatobiliary: Increased bilirubin levels Renal/urinary disorders: Acute renal insufficiency Vascular disorders: Distal limb ischemia Metabolic: Hyponatremia Skin: Ischemic lesions Postmarketing Experience Reversible diabetes insipidus [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] The most common adverse reactions include decreased cardiac output, bradycardia, tachyarrhythmias, hyponatremia and ischemia (coronary, mesenteric, skin, digital).
