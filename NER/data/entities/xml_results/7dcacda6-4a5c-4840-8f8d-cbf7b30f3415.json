    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently and may require dose reduction or treatment interruption. ( 5.2 ) Sepsis occurred in patients with or without neutropenia who received paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in combination with gemcitabine; interrupt paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine until sepsis resolves, and if neutropenia, until neutrophils are at least 1500 cells/mm 3 , then resume treatment at reduced dose levels. ( 5.3 ) Pneumonitis occurred with the use of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in combination with gemcitabine; permanently discontinue treatment with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumisn-bound) and gemcitabine. ( 5.4 ) Severe hypersensitivity reactions with fatal outcome have been reported. Do not rechallenge with this drug. ( 4 , 5.5 ) Exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased in patients with hepatic impairment, consider dose reduction and closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment. ( 2.5 , 5.6 ) Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) contains albumin derived from human blood, which has a theoretical risk of viral transmission. ( 5.7 ) Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe Myelosuppression Severe myelosuppression (primarily neutropenia) is dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). In clinical studies, Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 34% of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), 47% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 38% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Monitor for severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia by performing complete blood cell counts frequently, including prior to dosing on Day 1 (for MBC) and Days 1, 8, and 15 (for NSCLC and for pancreatic cancer). Do not administer paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) to patients with baseline absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) of less than 1,500 cells/mm 3 [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] In the case of severe neutropenia (<500 cells/mm 3 for seven days or more) during a course of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) therapy, reduce the dose of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in subsequent courses in patients with either MBC or NSCLC. In patients with MBC, resume treatment with every-3-week cycles of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) after ANC recovers to a level >1,500 cells/mm 3 and platelets recover to a level >100,000 cells/mm 3 . In patients with NSCLC, resume treatment if recommended at permanently reduced doses for both weekly paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and every-3-week carboplatin after ANC recovers to at least 1500 cells/mm 3 and platelet count of at least 100,000 cells/mm 3 on Day 1 or to an ANC of at least 500 cells/mm 3 and platelet count of at least 50,000 cells/mm 3 on Days 8 or 15 of the cycle [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. In patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, withhold paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine if the ANC is less than 500 cells/mm 3 or platelets are less than 50,000 cells/mm 3 and delay initiation of the next cycle if the ANC is less than 1500 cells/mm 3 or platelet count is less than 100,000 cells/mm 3 on Day 1 of the cycle. Resume treatment with appropriate dose reduction if recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. 5.2 Severe Neuropathy Sensory neuropathy is dose- and schedule-dependent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . If \u2265\u00a0Grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, withhold paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) treatment until resolution to Grade 1 or 2 for metastatic breast cancer or until resolution to \u2264\u00a0 Grade 1 for NSCLC and pancreatic cancer followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.3 Sepsis Sepsis occurred in 5% of patients with or without neutropenia who received of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in combination with gemcitabine. Biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent were risk factors for severe or fatal sepsis. If a patient becomes febrile (regardless of ANC) initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, interrupt protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC \u2265 1500, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.6 )] 5.4 Pneumonitis Pneumonitis, including some cases that were fatal, occurred in 4% of patients receiving paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in combination with gemcitabine. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and interrupt paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine during evaluation of suspected pneumonitis. After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, permanently discontinue treatment with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine. 5.5 Severe Hypersensitivity Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported. Do not rechallenge patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) with this drug [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] Cross-hypersensitivity between paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and other taxane products has been reported and may include severe reactions such as anaphylaxis. Closely monitor patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to other taxanes during initiation of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) therapy. 5.6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased in patients with hepatic impairment. Closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment for severe myelosuppression. Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) is not recommended in patients who have total bilirubin >5\u00a0x\u00a0ULN or AST >10 x ULN. In addition, paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) is not recommended in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN and AST \u226410 x ULN). Reduce the starting dose for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.7 Albumin (Human) Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) contains albumin (human), a derivative of human blood. Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes, it carries a remote risk for transmission of viral diseases. A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) also is considered extremely remote. No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin. 5.8 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on mechanism of action and findings in animals, paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin-bound particles to rats during pregnancy at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area, caused embryo-fetal toxicities, including intrauterine mortality, increased resorptions, reduced numbers of live fetuses, and malformations. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception and avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and for at least six months after the last dose of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]. Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies, advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception and avoid fathering a child during treatment with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and for at least three months after the last dose of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )].",

Other Adverse Reactions Hematologic Disorders Neutropenia was dose dependent and reversible. Among patients with metastatic breast cancer in the randomized trial, neutrophil counts declined below 500 cells/mm 3 (Grade 4) in 9% of the patients treated with a dose of 260 mg/m 2 compared to 22% in patients receiving paclitaxel injection at a dose of 175 mg/m 2 . Pancytopenia has been observed in clinical trials. Infections Infectious episodes were reported in 24% of the patients treated with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Oral candidiasis, respiratory tract infections and pneumonia were the most frequently reported infectious complications. Hypersensitivity Reactions (HSRs) Grade 1 or 2 HSRs occurred on the day of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administration and consisted of dyspnea (1%) and flushing, hypotension, chest pain, and arrhythmia (all <1%). The use of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in patients previously exhibiting hypersensitivity to paclitaxel injection or human albumin has not been studied. Cardiovascular Hypotension, during the 30-minute infusion, occurred in 5% of patients. Bradycardia, during the 30-minute infusion, occurred in <1% of patients. These vital sign changes most often caused no symptoms and required neither specific therapy nor treatment discontinuation. Severe cardiovascular events possibly related to single-agent paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) occurred in approximately 3% of patients. These events included cardiac ischemia/infarction, chest pain, cardiac arrest, supraventricular tachycardia, edema, thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary emboli, and hypertension. Cases of cerebrovascular attacks (strokes) and transient ischemic attacks have been reported. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were common among patients at baseline. ECG abnormalities on study did not usually result in symptoms, were not dose-limiting, and required no intervention. ECG abnormalities were noted in 60% of patients. Among patients with a normal ECG prior to study entry, 35% of all patients developed an abnormal tracing while on study. The most frequently reported ECG modifications were non-specific repolarization abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, and sinus tachycardia. Respiratory Dyspnea (12%), cough (7%), and pneumothorax (<1%) were reported after treatment with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Neurologic The frequency and severity of sensory neuropathy increased with cumulative dose. Sensory neuropathy was the cause of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin\u2011bound) discontinuation in 7/229 (3%) patients. Twenty-four patients (10%) treated with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) developed Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy; of these patients, 14 had documented improvement after a median of 22 days; 10 patients resumed treatment at a reduced dose of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and 2 discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy. Of the 10 patients without documented improvement, 4 discontinued the study due to peripheral neuropathy. No Grade 4 sensory neuropathies were reported. Only one incident of motor neuropathy (Grade 2) was observed in either arm of the controlled trial. Vision Disorders Ocular/visual disturbances occurred in 13% of all patients (n=366) treated with paclitaxel protein\u2011bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and 1% were severe. The severe cases (keratitis and blurred vision) were reported in patients who received higher doses than those recommended (300 or 375 mg/m 2 ). These effects generally have been reversible. Arthralgia/Myalgia The symptoms were usually transient, occurred two or three days after paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administration, and resolved within a few days. Hepatic Grade 3 or 4 elevations in GGT were reported for 14% of patients treated with paclitaxel protein\u2011bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and 10% of patients treated with paclitaxel injection in the randomized trial. Renal Overall 11% of patients experienced creatinine elevation, 1% severe. No discontinuations, dose reductions, or dose delays were caused by renal toxicities. Other Clinical Events Nail changes (changes in pigmentation or discoloration of nail bed) have been reported. Edema occurred in 10% of patients; no patients had severe edema. Dehydration and pyrexia were also reported. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Adverse reactions were assessed in 514 paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/carboplatin-treated patients and 524 paclitaxel injection/carboplatin-treated patients receiving first-line systemic treatment for locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial. Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m 2 , following premedication. In both treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg\u2022min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/paclitaxel infusion. The differences in paclitaxel dose and schedule between the two arms limit direct comparison of dose- and schedule-dependent adverse reactions. Among patients evaluable for adverse reactions, the median age was 60 years, 75% were men, 81% were White, 49% had adenocarcinoma, 43% had squamous cell lung cancer, 76% were ECOG PS 1. Patients in both treatment arms received a median of 6 cycles of treatment. The following common (\u2265 10% incidence) adverse reactions were observed at a similar incidence in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) plus carboplatin-treated and paclitaxel injection plus carboplatin-treated patients: alopecia 56%, nausea 27%, fatigue 25%, decreased appetite 17%, asthenia 16%, constipation 16%, diarrhea 15%, vomiting 12%, dyspnea 12%, and rash 10% (incidence rates are for the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) plus carboplatin treatment group).

Grade 3 neuropathy improved to Grade 1 or resolved in 10/17 patients (59%) following interruption or discontinuation of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas Adverse reactions were assessed in 421 patients who received paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) plus gemcitabine and 402 patients who received gemcitabine for the first-line systemic treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in a multicenter, multinational, randomized, controlled, open-label trial. Patients received a median treatment duration of 3.9 months in the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/gemcitabine group and 2.8 months in the gemcitabine group. For the treated population, the median relative dose intensity for gemcitabine was 75% in the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/gemcitabine group and 85% in the gemcitabine group. The median relative dose intensity of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) was 81%.

The median time to first occurrence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) arm was 140 days. Upon suspension of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) dosing, the median time to improvement from Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy to \u2264 Grade 1 was 29 days. Of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)-treated patients with Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, 44% resumed paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) at a reduced dose. Sepsis Sepsis occurred in 5% of patients who received paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/gemcitabine compared to 2% of patients who received gemcitabine alone. Sepsis occurred both in patients with and without neutropenia. Risk factors for sepsis included biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent. Pneumonitis Pneumonitis occurred in 4% of patients who received paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/gemcitabine compared to 1% of patients who received gemcitabine alone. Two of 17 patients in the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) arm with pneumonitis died. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) or with paclitaxel injection and may be expected to occur with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions. Cross-hypersensitivity between paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and other taxanes has been reported. Cardiovascular Congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and atrioventricular block. Most patients were previously exposed to cardiotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, or had underlying cardiac history. Respiratory Pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. Radiation pneumonitis in patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy. Lung fibrosis has been reported with paclitaxel injection. Neurologic Cranial nerve palsies and vocal cord paresis, as well as autonomic neuropathy resulting in paralytic ileus. Vision Disorders Reduced visual acuity due to cystoid macular edema (CME). After cessation of treatment, CME may improve, and visual acuity may return to baseline. Abnormal visual evoked potentials in patients treated with paclitaxel injection suggest persistent optic nerve damage. Hepatic Hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death in patients treated with paclitaxel injection. Gastrointestinal (GI) Intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, pancreatitis, and ischemic colitis. In patients treated with paclitaxel injection, neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) despite the coadministration of G-CSF, alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Injection Site Reaction Extravasation. Closely monitor the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration [see Dosage and Administration . 2.1 )] Severe events such as phlebitis, cellulitis, induration, necrosis, and fibrosis have been reported with paclitaxel injection. In some cases, the onset of the injection site reaction occurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed up to ten days. Recurrence of skin reactions at a site of previous extravasation following administration of paclitaxel injection at a different site has been reported. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Tumor lysis syndrome. Other Clinical Events Skin reactions including generalized or maculopapular rash, erythema, and pruritus Photosensitivity reactions, radiation recall phenomenon, scleroderma, and in some patients previously exposed to capecitabine, reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. Conjunctivitis, cellulitis, and increased lacrimation have been reported with paclitaxel injection. Accidental Exposure Upon inhalation of paclitaxel, dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat, and nausea have been reported. Following topical exposure, tingling, burning, and redness have been reported.",
