    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray contains butorphanol, a Schedule IV controlled substance. As an opioid, Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see . DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ] Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, and reassess all patients receiving Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray for the development of these behaviors or conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse ( including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction ) or mental illness ( e.g. , major depression ) . The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see . WARNINGS , Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ; Dosage and Administration , Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose ] Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see . Carbon dioxide ( CO OVERDOSAGE ] 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray are essential [see . Overestimating the Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ] Accidental exposure to even one dose of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of butorphanol. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see . PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients ] Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea ( CSA ) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ] Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines ( e.g. , by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program ) . Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see . PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients ] Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of other CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members ( including children ) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose ; WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse , Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants ; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients ; OVERDOSAGE ] Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol ( e.g. , non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids ) . Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see . PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ] If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression ( including sedation ) . If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see . WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ; Dosage and Administration , Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose ] Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants ( including alcohol and illicit drugs ) . Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see . PRECAUTIONS ; Information for Patients , Drug Interactions ] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see . PRECAUTIONS ; Information for Patients , Pregnancy ] Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: \u2022 Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education ( CE ) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. \u2022 Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide ( PCG ) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . \u2022 Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. \u2022 Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 800-503-0784, or log on to http://www.opioidanalgesicrems.com/ . The FDA Blueprint can be found at https://www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint . Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3 A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Concomitant use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray with a CYP3 A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics ( e.g. , erythromycin ) , azole-antifungal agents ( e.g. , ketoconazole ) , and protease inhibitors ( e.g. , ritonavir ) , may increase plasma concentrations of butorphanol and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is achieved. Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3 A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray-treated patients may increase butorphanol plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When using Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray with CYP3 A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3 A4 inducers in Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray-treated patients, evaluate patients at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray until stable drug effects are achieved WARNINGS ; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ] [see . PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ] Concomitant use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray with CYP3 A4 inducers or discontinuation of a CYP3 A4 inhibitor could decrease butorphanol plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to butorphanol. When using Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray with CYP3 A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3 A4 inhibitors, monitor patients closely at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see . PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ] Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia ( OIH ) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see . Symptoms of OIH include ( but may not be limited to ) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli ( allodynia ) . These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. Dependence ] Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation ( safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety ) [see . Dosage and Administration ; Warnings ] Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray [see . WARNINGS ] Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see . WARNINGS ] Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and when Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. WARNINGS ] Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention ( e.g. , those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors ) , Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. Butorphanol in Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The butorphanol in Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray therapy. Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see . Dosage and Administration , Drug Abuse and Dependence ] Additionally, the use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray, a mixed agonist/antagonist opioid analgesic, in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid concomitant use of butorphanol tartrate nasal spray with a full opioid agonist analgesic. Cardiovascular Effects Because butorphanol may increase the work of the heart, especially the pulmonary circuit, the use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in patients with acute myocardial infarction, ventricular dysfunction, or coronary insufficiency should be limited to those situations where the benefits clearly outweigh the risk [see . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ] Severe hypertension has been reported rarely during Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray therapy. In such cases, Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray should be discontinued and the hypertension treated with antihypertensive drugs. In patients who are not opioid dependent, naloxone has also been reported to be effective.PRECAUTIONS General Hypotension associated with syncope during the first hour of dosing with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray has been reported rarely, particularly in patients with past history of similar reactions to opioid analgesics. Therefore, patients should be advised to avoid activities with potential risks. Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and know how they will react to the medication [see . PRECAUTIONS ; Information for Patients ] Disorders of Respiratory Function or Control Butorphanol may produce respiratory depression, especially in patients receiving other CNS active agents, or patients suffering from CNS diseases or respiratory impairment. Hepatic and Renal Disease In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the initial dose sequence of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray should be limited to 1 mg followed, if needed, by 1 mg in 90 to 120 minutes. The repeat dose sequence in these patients should be determined by the patient\u2019s response rather than at fixed times but will generally be at intervals of no less than at 6 hours [see . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and Individualization of Dosage ] Information for Patients Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( ) . Medication Guide Storage and Disposal Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home. Inform patients that leaving Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home [see . WARNINGS , DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ] Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Inform patients that the use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see Instruct patients not to share Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray with others and to take steps to protect Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray from theft or misuse. WARNINGS ] . Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see . WARNINGS, Life Threatening Respiratory Depression ] Accidental Exposure Inform patients that accidental exposure, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see Instruct patients to take steps to store Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray securely and to dispose of unused Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray by unscrewing the cap, rinsing the bottle, and placing the parts in the waste container. WARNINGS ] . Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ] . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines ( e.g. , by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program ) [see . WARNINGS , Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ; DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ] Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone\u2019s effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see . OVERDOSAGE ] If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers: \u2022 How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose \u2022 To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency \u2022 To read the Patient Information ( or other educational material ) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see . WARNINGS , ADVERSE REACTIONS ] Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions ] . Important Administration Instructions Inform patients of the proper use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray [see PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS and MEDICATION GUIDE ] . Important Discontinuation Instructions In order to avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ] Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Inform patients that Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery and to avoid such tasks while taking this product, until they know how they will react to the medication [see . WARNINGS ] Constipation Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see . ADVERSE REACTIONS ] Adrenal Insufficiency Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see . WARNINGS ] Anaphylaxis Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention [see CONTRAINDICATIONS , ADVERSE REACTIONS ] . Pregnancy Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Inform female patients of reproductive potential that use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated [see ; WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS . Pregnancy ] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Inform female patients of reproductive potential that Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray can cause fetal harm and to inform the healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see . PRECAUTIONS ; Pregnancy ] Lactation Advise nursing mothers to carefully observe infants for increased sleepiness ( more than usual ) , breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to seek immediate medical care if they notice these signs [see . PRECAUTIONS ; Nursing Mothers ] Infertility Inform patients that use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see . ADVERSE REACTIONS ] Drug Interactions Benzodiazepine and Other Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Depressants Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression ( including sedation ) . If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see . WARNINGS ] Serotonergic Drugs The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system ( e.g. , mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol ) , certain muscle relaxants ( i.e. , cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone ) , monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors ( those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue ) , has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see . PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients ] If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Cytochrome P450 ( CYP 450 ) Interactions It is not known if the effects of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray are altered by concomitant medications that affect hepatic metabolism of drugs ( CYP 450 inhibitors or inducers ) ( e.g. , erythromycin, theophylline, etc. ) , but physicians should be alert to the possibility that a smaller initial dose and longer intervals between doses may be needed. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOIs ) No information is available about the use of butorphanol concurrently with MAO inhibitors. Advise patient to avoid concomitant use of these drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats given butorphanol tartrate in the diet up to 60 mg/kg/day ( 24 and 48 times the human daily dose of 12 mg/day based on a body surface area comparison, respectively ) . There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in either species in these studies. Mutagenesis Butorphanol was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames ) or in an in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis and repair assay conducted in cultured human fibroblast cells. Impairment of Fertility In a study where male rats were treated subcutaneously with 0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg butorphanol for 75 days prior to mating to female rats treated subcutaneously with 0.5 or 2.5 mg/kg butorphanol for 14 days prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation, no adverse effects on fertility were noted ( 0.4- and 2 times the human daily dose of 12 mg based on body surface area ) . In a study where male rats were treated orally with 10, 40, or 160 mg/kg for 63 days prior to mating to female rats treated orally with the same doses of butorphanol for 14 days prior to mating, reduced pregnancy rates were reported in the high dose group ( 130-times the human daily dose of 12 mg based on body surface area ) . Pregnancy Reproduction studies in mice, rats, and rabbits during organogenesis did not reveal any teratogenic potential to butorphanol. However, pregnant rats treated subcutaneously with butorphanol at 1 mg/kg ( 5.9 mg/m 2 ) had a higher frequency of stillbirths than controls. Butorphanol at 30 mg/kg/oral ( 360 mg/m 2 ) and 60 mg/kg/oral ( 720 mg/m 2 ) also showed higher incidences of postimplantation loss in rabbits. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in pregnant women before 37 weeks of gestation. Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid analgesics for an extended period of time during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see . WARNINGS ] Labor and Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is not recommended during labor or delivery because there is no clinical experience with its use in this setting. Nursing Mothers Although there is no clinical experience with the use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in nursing mothers, butorphanol has been detected in milk following administration of butorphanol tartrate injection to nursing mothers. The amount an infant would receive is probably clinically insignificant ( estimated 4 mcg/L of milk in a mother receiving 2 mg IM four times a day ) . It should be assumed that butorphanol will appear in the milk in similar amounts following the nasal route of administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from butorphanol or from the underlying maternal condition. Infants exposed to Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility and ADVERSE REACTIONS ] Pediatric Use Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of age because safety and efficacy have not been established in this population. Geriatric Use Elderly patients ( aged 65 years or older ) may have increased sensitivity to Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Of the approximately 1700 patients treated with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray in clinical studies, 8% were 65 years of age or older and 2% were 75 years or older. Due to changes in clearance, the mean half-life of butorphanol is increased by 25% ( to over 6 hours ) in patients over the age of 65 years [see Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the side effects of butorphanol. In clinical studies of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray, elderly patients had an increased frequency of headache, dizziness, drowsiness, vertigo, constipation, nausea and/or vomiting, and nasal congestion compared with younger patients. There are insufficient efficacy data for patients \u226565 years to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics ] . Initially a 1 mg dose of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray should be generally used in geriatric patients and 90 to 120 minutes should elapse before administering a second 1 mg dose, if needed [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Individualization of Dosage ] . In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ] . Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were coadministered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see WARNINGS ] . This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to regularly evaluate renal function.",
    "adverseReactions": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Experience A total of 788 patients were studied in premarketing clinical trials of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. In nearly all cases the type and incidence of side effects with butorphanol were those commonly observed with opioid analgesics. The adverse experiences described below are based on data from short-term and long-term clinical trials in patients receiving intranasal butorphanol, except acute studies in normal subjects. There has been no attempt to correct for placebo effect or to subtract the frequencies reported by placebo-treated patients in controlled trials. The most frequently reported adverse experiences across all clinical trials with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray were somnolence ( 49% ) , dizziness ( 23% ) , nausea and/or vomiting ( 8% ) . In long-term trials with Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray only, nasal congestion ( 13% ) and insomnia ( 11% ) were frequently reported. The following adverse experiences were reported at a frequency of 1% or greater in clinical trials, and were considered to be probably related to the use of butorphanol. Body as a Whole: Asthenia/lethargy, headache, sensation of heat, pain Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hypotension Digestive: Anorexia, constipation, dry mouth, nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea Nervous: Anxiety, confusion, dizziness, euphoria, floating feeling, insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, tremor Respiratory: Epistaxis, nasal congestion, nasal irritation, rhinitis, sinus congestion, sinusitis, nose pain Skin and Appendages: Sweating, pruritus Special Senses: Blurred vision, ear pain, tinnitus, unpleasant taste The following adverse experiences were reported with a frequency of less than 1% in clinical trials and were considered to be probably related to the use of butorphanol. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, syncope Nervous: Abnormal dreams, agitation, dysphoria, hallucinations, hostility, withdrawal symptoms Skin and Appendages: Rash/hives Urogenital: Impaired urination The following infrequent additional adverse experiences were reported in a frequency of less than 1% of the patients studied in short-term Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray trials or trials of butorphanol tartrate injection and under circumstances where the association between these events and butorphanol administration is unknown. They are being listed as alerting information for the physician due to their clinical significance. Body as a Whole: Edema Cardiovascular: Chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia Nervous: Depression Respiratory: Shallow breathing Hypoglycemia: Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor ( e.g. , diabetes ) . Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Serotonin Syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. \u2022 Adrenal Insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. \u2022 Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Butorphanol Tartrate Nasal Spray. \u2022 Androgen Deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with use of opioids for an extended period of time [see . CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ] \u2022 Hyperalgesia and Allodynia: Cases of hyperalgesia and allodynia have been reported with opioid therapy of any duration [see . WARNINGS ]",
