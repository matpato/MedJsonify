    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse: Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. ( 5.1 ) Respiratory Depression: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine use. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with buprenorphine sublingual tablets. ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) Unintentional Pediatric Exposure: Store buprenorphine sublingual tablets safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children. ( 5.4 ) Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy. ( 5.5 ) A d renal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment is temporarily interrupted or discontinued, monitor patients for withdrawal and treat appropriately. ( 5.7 ) Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events: Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events. ( 5.8 ) Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms: An opioid withdrawal syndrome is likely to occur with parenteral misuse of buprenorphine sublingual tablets by individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists, or by sublingual administration before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. ( 5.10 ) Risk of Overdose in Opioid-Na\u00efve Patients: Buprenorphine sublingual tablets are NOT appropriate as an analgesic. There have been reported deaths of opioid na\u00efve individuals who received a 2 mg sublingual dose of buprenorphine. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Buprenorphine is a Schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient\u2019s level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 ) ] . 5.2 Risk of Life-Threatening Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, postmarketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuses by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with buprenorphine sublingual tablets [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Use buprenorphine sublingual tablets with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Patient Counseling Information ( . 17 )] Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )]. Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with buprenorphine sublingual tablets. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Advise patients and caregivers that naloxone may also be administered for a known or suspected overdose with buprenorphine sublingual tablets itself. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary due to the long duration of action of buprenorphine sublingual tablets and its affinity for the mu-opioid \u00a0receptor [see Overdosage ( . 10 )] Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) . Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and, if naloxone is prescribed, how to treat with naloxone. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.3 Managing Risks from Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death. Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs. Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone. As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate. Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate. For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia. Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia. Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient\u2019s buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use. If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs. Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine\u00a0can cause\u00a0severe, possibly\u00a0fatal, respiratory\u00a0depression in children who are\u00a0accidentally\u00a0exposed to it. Store\u00a0buprenorphine-containing\u00a0medications safely\u00a0out of\u00a0the\u00a0sight and reach of\u00a0children and\u00a0destroy\u00a0any\u00a0unused medication appropriately [s e e Pati e nt C ouns e ling ( 17 ) ] . 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with buprenorphine sublingual tablets of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( . This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. 8.1 )] 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt\nDiscontinuation Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( When discontinuing buprenorphine sublingual tablets, gradually taper the dosage 9.3 )]. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )]. 5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of\u00a0cytolytic\u00a0hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice\u00a0have\u00a0been observed\u00a0in individuals\u00a0receiving\u00a0buprenorphine\u00a0in clinical trials and through postmarketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case\u00a0reports of\u00a0death, hepatic failure, hepatic\u00a0necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic\u00a0encephalopathy.\u00a0In many\u00a0cases, the\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0pre-existing\u00a0liver enzyme abnormalities, infection\u00a0with hepatitis B\u00a0or\u00a0hepatitis C\u00a0virus, concomitant usage\u00a0of\u00a0other potentially\u00a0hepatotoxic\u00a0drugs,\u00a0and ongoing\u00a0injecting\u00a0drug\u00a0use\u00a0may\u00a0have\u00a0played a\u00a0causative\u00a0or contributory\u00a0role.\u00a0In other cases, insufficient data\u00a0were\u00a0available\u00a0to determine\u00a0the etiology\u00a0of\u00a0the abnormality. Withdrawal of\u00a0buprenorphine\u00a0has resulted in amelioration of\u00a0acute\u00a0hepatitis in some cases; however, in\u00a0other cases no dose\u00a0reduction was necessary. The\u00a0possibility\u00a0exists that\u00a0buprenorphine\u00a0had a\u00a0causative\u00a0or contributory\u00a0role\u00a0in the\u00a0development of\u00a0the\u00a0hepatic\u00a0abnormality in some cases.\u00a0Liver\u00a0function tests, prior\u00a0to initiation of\u00a0treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic\u00a0monitoring\u00a0of\u00a0liver function during\u00a0treatment is also recommended. A biological and\u00a0etiological evaluation is recommended when a\u00a0hepatic\u00a0event\u00a0is suspected. Depending\u00a0on the\u00a0case,\u00a0buprenorphine\u00a0sublingual tablets may\u00a0need to be carefully\u00a0discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a\u00a0return by\u00a0the\u00a0patient to illicit drug\u00a0use, and\u00a0strict monitoring\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0patient should be\u00a0initiated. 5.9 Hypersensitivity\u00a0Reactions Cases of\u00a0hypersensitivity\u00a0to buprenorphine\u00a0products have\u00a0been\u00a0reported both in clinical trials and\u00a0in the\u00a0postmarketing experience. Cases of\u00a0bronchospasm, angioneurotic\u00a0edema, and anaphylactic\u00a0shock have\u00a0been reported. The\u00a0most\u00a0common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history\u00a0of\u00a0hypersensitivity\u00a0to buprenorphine\u00a0is a\u00a0contraindication to the\u00a0use of\u00a0buprenorphine\u00a0sublingual tablets. 5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0partial\u00a0agonist properties of\u00a0buprenorphine, buprenorphine sublingual tablets\u00a0may\u00a0precipitate\u00a0opioid withdrawal signs\u00a0and symptoms in individuals physically\u00a0dependent on full opioid agonists if administered sublingually\u00a0or\u00a0parenterally\u00a0before\u00a0the\u00a0agonist effects of other\u00a0opioids have\u00a0subsided. 5.11 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Na\u00efve Patients There\u00a0have\u00a0been reported\u00a0deaths of\u00a0opioid na\u00efve\u00a0individuals who received a\u00a02 mg\u00a0dose\u00a0of\u00a0buprenorphine\u00a0as a\u00a0sublingual tablet for analgesia. Buprenorphine\u00a0sublingual tablets\u00a0are not appropriate\u00a0as an analgesic. 5.12 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function In a pharmacokinetic study, buprenorphine plasma levels were found to be higher and the half-life was found to be longer in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, but not in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. For patients with severe hepatic impairment, a dose adjustment is recommended, and patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment should be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.13 Dental Adverse Events Cases of dental caries, some severe (i.e., tooth fracture, tooth loss), have been reported following the use of transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products. Reported events include cavities, tooth decay, dental abscesses/infection, rampant caries, tooth erosion, fillings falling out, and, in some cases, total tooth loss. Treatment for these events included tooth extraction, root canal, dental surgery, as well as other restorative procedures (i.e., fillings, crowns, implants, dentures). Multiple cases were reported in individuals without any prior history of dental problems. Refer patients to dental care services and encourage them to have regular dental checkups while taking buprenorphine sublingual tablets. Educate patients to seek dental care and strategies to maintain or improve oral health while being treated with transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products. Strategies include, but are not limited to, gently rinsing the teeth and gums with water and then swallowing after buprenorphine sublingual tablets has been completely dissolved in the oral mucosa. Advise patients to wait for at least one hour after taking buprenorphine sublingual tablets before brushing teeth [see Dosing and Administration ( 2.6 ), Information for Patients ( 17 ), Medication Guide]. 5.14 QTc Prolongation Thorough QT studies with buprenorphine products have demonstrated QT prolongation \u226415 msec. This QTc prolongation effect does not appear to be mediated by hERG channels. Based on these two findings, buprenorphine is unlikely to be pro-arrhythmic when used alone in patients without risk factors. The risk of combining buprenorphine with other QT-prolonging agents is not known. Consider these observations in clinical decisions when prescribing buprenorphine sublingual tablets to patients with risk factors such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, recent conversion from atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, digitalis therapy, baseline QT prolongation, subclinical long-QT syndrome, or severe hypomagnesemia. 5.15 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery Buprenorphine\u00a0sublingual tablets may\u00a0impair\u00a0the\u00a0mental or\u00a0physical abilities required\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0potentially\u00a0dangerous tasks such\u00a0as driving\u00a0a\u00a0car\u00a0or\u00a0operating\u00a0machinery, especially\u00a0during\u00a0treatment induction and dose adjustment. Caution patients about driving\u00a0or\u00a0operating\u00a0hazardous machinery\u00a0until they\u00a0are\u00a0reasonably\u00a0certain\u00a0that buprenorphine therapy\u00a0does not adversely\u00a0affect his or\u00a0her\u00a0ability\u00a0to engage\u00a0in such activities. 5.16 Orthostatic Hypotension Like\u00a0other\u00a0opioids, buprenorphine\u00a0sublingual tablets may\u00a0produce\u00a0orthostatic\u00a0hypotension in\u00a0ambulatory\u00a0patients. 5.17 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like\u00a0other\u00a0opioids, may\u00a0elevate\u00a0cerebrospinal fluid pressure\u00a0and should be\u00a0used\u00a0with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0increased.\u00a0Buprenorphine can produce\u00a0miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may\u00a0interfere\u00a0with patient evaluation. 5.18 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine\u00a0has been\u00a0shown to increase\u00a0intracholedochal pressure, as do\u00a0other\u00a0opioids, and\u00a0thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of\u00a0the\u00a0biliary\u00a0tract. 5.19 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other\u00a0opioids, buprenorphine\u00a0may\u00a0obscure\u00a0the\u00a0diagnosis or\u00a0clinical\u00a0course\u00a0of\u00a0patients\u00a0with acute abdominal conditions.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ] 5.1 ) Respiratory and CNS Depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Adrenal Insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Opioid Withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.10 )] Hepatitis, Hepatic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Orthostatic Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.16 )] Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.17 )] Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.18 )] Adverse events commonly observed with administration of buprenorphine are oral hypoesthesia, glossodynia, oral mucosal erythema, headache, nausea, vomiting, hyperhidrosis, constipation, signs and symptoms of withdrawal, insomnia, pain, and peripheral edema.\u00a0( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088, or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\u00a0Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of buprenorphine sublingual tablets was supported by clinical trials using buprenorphine sublingual tablets, buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data were available from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in treatment of opioid addiction. Few differences in adverse event profile were noted between buprenorphine sublingual tablets or buprenorphine administered as a sublingual solution. The following adverse events were reported to occur by at least 5% of patients in a 4-week study (Table 1).

Doses in this table cannot necessarily be delivered in tablet form, but for comparison purposes: \"Very low\" dose (1 mg solution) would be less than a tablet dose of 2 mg \"Low\" dose (4 mg solution) approximates a 6 mg tablet dose \"Moderate\" dose (8 mg solution) approximates a 12 mg tablet dose \"High\" dose (16 mg solution) approximates a 24 mg tablet dose 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of buprenorphine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequently reported postmarketing adverse events with buprenorphine not observed in clinical trials, excluding drug exposure during pregnancy, was drug misuse or abuse. S er otonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in buprenorphine sublingual tablets. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.2 )] Local reactions : Dental decay (including caries, tooth fracture, and tooth loss), glossodynia, glossitis, oral mucosal erythema, oral hypoesthesia, and stomatitis. Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes).",
