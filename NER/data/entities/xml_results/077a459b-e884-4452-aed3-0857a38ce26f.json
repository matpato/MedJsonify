Leucovorin Calcium for Injection is also indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination and of inadvertent overdosages of folic acid antagonists. Leucovorin Calcium for Injection is indicated in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible. Leucovorin Calcium for Injection is also indicated for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Leucovorin Calcium for Injection should not be mixed in the same infusion as 5-fluorouracil because a precipitate may form.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS In the treatment of accidental overdosages of folic acid antagonists, intravenous leucovorin calcium should be administered as promptly as possible. As the time interval between antifolate administration (e.g., methotrexate) and leucovorin rescue increases, leucovorin calcium's effectiveness in counteracting toxicity decreases. In the treatment of accidental overdosages of intrathecally administered folic acid antagonists, do not administer leucovorin calcium intrathecally. LEUCOVORIN CALCIUM MAY BE HARMFUL OR FATAL IF GIVEN INTRATHECALLY. Monitoring of the serum methotrexate concentration is essential in determining the optimal dose and duration of treatment with leucovorin calcium. Delayed methotrexate excretion may be caused by a third space fluid accumulation (ie, ascites, pleural effusion), renal insufficiency, or inadequate hydration. Under such circumstances, higher doses of leucovorin calcium or prolonged administration may be indicated. Doses higher than those recommended for oral use must be given intravenously. Because of the benzyl alcohol contained in certain diluents used for reconstituting Leucovorin Calcium for Injection, when doses greater than 10 mg/m 2 are administered, leucovorin calcium for injection should be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection, USP, and used immediately. (See .) DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin calcium solution, no more than 160 mg of leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16 mL of a 10 mg per mL, or 8 mL of a 20 mg per mL solution per minute). Leucovorin calcium enhances the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. When these drugs are administered concurrently in the palliative therapy of advanced colorectal cancer, the dosage of 5-fluorouracil must be lower than usually administered. Although the toxicities observed in patients treated with the combination of leucovorin calcium plus 5-fluorouracil are qualitatively similar to those observed in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil alone, gastrointestinal toxicities (particularly stomatitis and diarrhea) are observed more commonly and may be more severe and of prolonged duration in patients treated with the combination. In the first Mayo/NCCTG controlled trial, toxicity, primarily gastrointestinal, resulted in 7% of patients requiring hospitalization when treated with 5-fluorouracil alone or 5-fluorouracil in combination with 200 mg/m 2 of leucovorin calcium and 20% when treated with 5-fluorouracil in combination with 20 mg/m 2 of leucovorin calcium. In the second Mayo/NCCTG trial, hospitalizations related to treatment toxicity also appeared to occur more often in patients treated with the low dose leucovorin calcium/5-fluorouracil combination than in patients treated with the high dose combination \u2014 11% versus 3%. Therapy with leucovorin calcium and 5-fluorouracil must not be initiated or continued in patients who have symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity of any severity, until those symptoms have completely resolved. Patients with diarrhea must be monitored with particular care until the diarrhea has resolved, as rapid clinical deterioration leading to death can occur. In an additional study utilizing higher weekly doses of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin calcium, elderly and/or debilitated patients were found to be at greater risk for severe gastrointestinal toxicity. Seizures and/or syncope have been reported rarely in cancer patients receiving leucovorin calcium, usually in association with fluoropyrimidine administration, and most commonly in those with CNS metastases or other predisposing factors, however, a causal relationship has not been established. The concomitant use of leucovorin calcium with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection was associated with increased rates of treatment failure and morbidity in a placebo-controlled study.PRECAUTIONS General Parenteral administration is preferable to oral dosing if there is a possibility that the patient may vomit and not absorb the leucovorin. Leucovorin has no effect on non-hematologic toxicities of methotrexate, such as the nephrotoxicity resulting from drug and/or metabolite precipitation in the kidney. Since leucovorin calcium enhances the toxicity of fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium/5-fluorouracil combination therapy for advanced colorectal cancer should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of antimetabolite cancer chemotherapy. Particular care should be taken in the treatment of elderly or debilitated colorectal cancer patients, as these patients may be at increased risk of severe toxicity. Laboratory Tests Patients being treated with the leucovorin calcium/5-fluorouracil combination should have a CBC with differential and platelets prior to each treatment. During the first two courses a CBC with differential and platelets has to be repeated weekly and thereafter once each cycle at the time of anticipated WBC nadir. Electrolytes and liver function tests should be performed prior to each treatment for the first three cycles then prior to every other cycle. Dosage modifications of fluorouracil should be instituted as follows, based on the most severe toxicities: Diarrhea and/or Stomatitis WBC/mm 3 Nadir Platelets/mm 3 Nadir 5-FU Dose Moderate 1,000-1,900 25-75,000 decrease 20% Severe < 1,000 < 25,000 decrease 30% If no toxicity occurs, the 5-fluorouracil dose may increase 10%. Treatment should be deferred until WBC's are 4,000/mm 3 and platelets 130,000/mm 3 . If blood counts do not reach these levels within two weeks, treatment should be discontinued. Patients should be followed up with physical examination prior to each treatment course and appropriate radiological examination as needed. Treatment should be discontinued when there is clear evidence of tumor progression. Drug Interactions Folic acid in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone, and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible pediatric patients. Preliminary animal and human studies have shown that small quantities of systemically administered leucovorin calcium enter the CSF primarily as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and, in humans, remain 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual methotrexate concentrations following intrathecal administration. However, high doses of leucovorin calcium may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered methotrexate. Leucovorin calcium may enhance the toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. (See .) WARNINGS Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Adequate animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with leucovorin calcium. It is also not known whether leucovorin calcium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Leucovorin calcium should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when leucovorin calcium is administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use See PRECAUTIONS , . Drug Interactions Geriatric Use Clinical studies of leucovorin calcium did not show differences in safety or effectiveness between subjects over 65 and younger subjects. Other clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older patients cannot be ruled out. This drug is known to be excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to the drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elder patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.",
