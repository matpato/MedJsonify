    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions : Immune-mediated adverse reactions (IMAR) can occur in any organ system or tissue, the following: immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated pneumonitis, and immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, and can occur at any time during treatment or after discontinuation. Monitor for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of IMAR. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone level and thyroid function including at baseline and before each dose. In general, withhold YERVOY for severe (grade 3) and permanently discontinue for life-threatening (grade 4) immune-mediated adverse reactions. See Full Prescribing Information for additional dosage modifications. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Infusion-Related Reactions : Discontinue for severe and life-threatening infusion-related reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion-related reactions. ( 2.3 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Complications of allogeneic HSCT : Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with YERVOY. (5.3) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise of potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions YERVOY is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks T-cell inhibitory signals induced by the CTLA-4 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response with the potential for induction of immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions listed herein may not be inclusive of all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting YERVOY. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of YERVOY. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of YERVOY. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate clinical chemistries including liver enzymes, creatinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function at baseline and before each dose. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue YERVOY depending on severity [see In general, if YERVOY requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Immune-Mediated Colitis YERVOY can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may be fatal. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a Single Agent Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 12% (62/511) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg as a single agent, including Grade 3-5 (7%) and Grade 2 (5%). Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY in 4.3% and withholding of at least one dose of YERVOY in 0.2% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 74% (46/62) of patients with immune-mediated colitis. Five patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Colitis resolved in 76% of the 62 patients. One patient was withheld one or more doses of YERVOY for colitis, and no patient received additional treatment after symptom improvement. YERVOY 1 mg/kg with 3 mg/kg Nivolumab Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 9% (60/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or mCRC, including Grade 3 (4.4%), and Grade 2 (3.7%). Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of YERVOY and nivolumab in 3.2% and withholding of YERVOY and nivolumab in 2.7% of patients. In patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab, use of systemic corticosteroids was one of the diagnostic criteria required to identify immune-mediated colitis. Systemic corticosteroids were therefore required in 100% (60/60) of patients with immune-mediated colitis. Approximately 23% of patients required coadministration of another immunosuppressant with corticosteroids. Colitis resolved in 95% of the 60 patients. Of the 18 patients in whom YERVOY or nivolumab was withheld for colitis, 16 received additional treatment after symptom improvement; of these, 10 had recurrence of colitis.

Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions Across clinical trials of YERVOY administered as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab, the following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions, some with fatal outcome, occurred in <1% of patients unless otherwise specified, as shown below: Nervous System: Autoimmune neuropathy (2%), meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, motor dysfunction Cardiovascular: Angiopathy, myocarditis, pericarditis, temporal arteritis, vasculitis Ocular: Blepharitis, episcleritis, iritis, orbital myositis, scleritis, uveitis. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, which has been observed in patients receiving YERVOY and may require treatment with systemic corticosteroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Duodenitis, gastritis, pancreatitis (1.3%) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Arthritis, myositis, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis Other (hematologic/immune): Aplastic anemia, conjunctivitis, cytopenias (2.5%), eosinophilia (2.1%), erythema multiforme, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), hypersensitivity vasculitis, meningitis, neurosensory hypoacusis, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and solid organ transplant rejection. 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Severe infusion-related reactions can occur with YERVOY. Discontinue YERVOY in patients with severe or life-threatening infusion reactions. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion reactions [see . Infusion-related reactions occurred in 0.6% (3/511) of patients who received single-agent YERVOY 3 mg/kg for the unresectable or metastatic treatment of melanoma. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 5% (33/666) of patients who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of RCC or CRC. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 8% (4/49) of patients who received YERVOY 3 mg/kg with nivolumab for the treatment of HCC. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (37/300) of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who received YERVOY 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant after YERVOY Fatal or serious graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can occur in patients who receive YERVOY either before or after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between CTLA-4 receptor blocking antibody and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of GVHD and intervene promptly [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with YERVOY after allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, YERVOY can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ipilimumab to cynomolgus monkeys from the onset of organogenesis through delivery resulted in higher incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with corresponding lower birth weight) and higher incidences of infant mortality in a dose-related manner. The effects of ipilimumab are likely to be greater during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with YERVOY and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , . 8.3 )] 5.5 Risks Associated When Administered in Combination with Nivolumab YERVOY is indicated for use in combination with nivolumab for patients with advanced RCC, MSI-H or dMMR mCRC, HCC, and NSCLC. Refer to the nivolumab Full Prescribing Information for additional risk information that applies to the combination use treatment.",
