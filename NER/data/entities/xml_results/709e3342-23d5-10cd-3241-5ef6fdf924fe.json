    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy ( Boxed Warning , 4.1 , 5.1 , 8.1 ). Demonstrated severe hypersensitivity to lenalidomide ( 4.2 , 5.9 , 5.15 ). 4.1 Pregnancy Lenalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. Limb abnormalities were seen in the offspring of monkeys that were dosed with lenalidomide during organogenesis. This effect was seen at all doses tested. Due to the results of this developmental monkey study, and lenalidomide's structural similarities to thalidomide, a known human teratogen, lenalidomide is contraindicated in females who are pregnant [see . If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus Boxed Warning ] [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 , 5.2 ), Use in Special Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] 4.2 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Lenalidomide is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity (e.g., angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) to lenalidomide [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.9 , 5.15 )]",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased Mortality: serious and fatal cardiac adverse reactions occurred in patients with CLL treated with lenalidomide ( 5.5 ). Second Primary Malignancies (SPM): Higher incidences of SPM were observed in controlled trials of patients with MM receiving lenalidomide ( 5.6 ). Increased Mortality: Observed in patients with MM when pembrolizumab was added to dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue ( 5.7 ). Hepatotoxicity: Hepatic failure including fatalities; monitor liver function. Stop lenalidomide and evaluate if hepatotoxicity is suspected ( 5.8 ). Severe Cutaneous Reactions: Discontinue lenalidomide for severe reactions ( 5.9 ). Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) including fatalities: Monitor patients at risk of TLS (i.e., those with high tumor burden) and take appropriate precautions ( 5.10 ). Tumor flare reaction: Serious tumor flare reactions, including fatal reactions have occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma ( 5.11 ). Impaired Stem Cell mobilization: A decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment (> 4 cycles) with lenalidomide has been reported. Consider early referral to transplant center ( 5.12 ). Early mortality in MCL: Higher rate of early deaths have occurred in patients with MCL ( 5.14 ). Hypersensitivity: Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity. Discontinue lenalidomide for angioedema and anaphylaxis ( 5.15 ). 5.1 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy. Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes life-threatening human birth defects or embryo-fetal death [see . An embryo-fetal development study in monkeys indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy, similar to birth defects observed in humans following exposure to thalidomide during pregnancy. Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] Lenalidomide is only available through the Lenalidomide REMS program [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning lenalidomide therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy. Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy. Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy. The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Males Lenalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug. Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking lenalidomide and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy. Male patients taking lenalidomide must not donate sperm and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with lenalidomide and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to lenalidomide. 5.2 Lenalidomide REMS Program Because of the embryo-fetal risk [see , lenalidomide is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), the Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Lenalidomide REMS program. Required components of the Lenalidomide REMS program include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the Lenalidomide REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements. Patients must sign a Patient-Physician agreement form and comply with the REMS requirements. In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see and males must comply with contraception requirements Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] Pharmacies must be certified with the Lenalidomide REMS program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive lenalidomide and comply with REMS requirements. Further information about the Lenalidomide REMS program is available at www.lenalidomiderems.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436. 5.3 Hematologic Toxicity Lenalidomide can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising, especially with use of concomitant medication that may increase risk of bleeding. Patients taking lenalidomide should have their complete blood counts assessed periodically as described below [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 )]. Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) in patients taking lenalidomide capsules in combination with dexamethasone or as lenalidomide maintenance therapy for MM every 7 days (weekly) for the first 2 cycles, on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 3, and every 28 days (4 weeks) thereafter. A dose interruption and/or dose reduction may be required [see . In the MM maintenance therapy trials, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in up to 59% of lenalidomide-treated patients and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in up to 38% of lenalidomide-treated patients Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) in patients taking lenalidomide for MDS weekly for the first 8 weeks and at least monthly thereafter. Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80% of patients enrolled in the MDS study. In the 48% of patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median time to onset was 42 days (range, 14 to 411 days), and the median time to documented recovery was 17 days (range, 2 to 170 days). In the 54% of patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to onset was 28 days (range, 8 to 290 days), and the median time to documented recovery was 22 days (range, 5 to 224 days) [see . Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) in patients taking lenalidomide for MCL weekly for the first cycle (28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles 2 to 4, and then monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction. In the MCL trial, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 43% of the patients. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 28% of the patients. Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) in patients taking lenalidomide for FL or MZL weekly for the first 3 weeks of Cycle 1 (28 days), every 2 weeks during Cycles 2 to 4, and then monthly thereafter. Patients may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction. In the AUGMENT and MAGNIFY trials, Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 50% and 33%, respectively, of patients in the lenalidomide /rituximab arm. Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 2% and 8%, respectively, of patients in the lenalidomide /rituximab arm [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.4 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism Venous thromboembolic events (VTE [DVT and PE]) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE, myocardial infarction and stroke) are increased in patients treated with lenalidomide. A significantly increased risk of DVT (7.4%) and of PE (3.7%) occurred in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated in the placebo and dexamethasone group (3.1% and 0.9%) in clinical trials with varying use of anticoagulant therapies. In the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis, DVT was reported as a serious adverse reaction (3.6%, 2.0%, and 1.7%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. The frequency of serious adverse reactions of PE was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms (3.8%, 2.8%, and 3.7%, respectively) [see . Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Myocardial infarction (1.7%) and stroke (CVA) (2.3%) are increased in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone (0.6%, and 0.9%) in clinical trials. In the NDMM study, myocardial infarction (including acute) was reported as a serious adverse reaction (2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.1%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. The frequency of serious adverse reactions of CVA was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms (0.8%, 0.6 %, and 0.6%, respectively) [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Patients with known risk factors, including prior thrombosis, may be at greater risk and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors (e.g. hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking). In controlled clinical trials that did not use concomitant thromboprophylaxis, 21.5% overall thrombotic events (Standardized MedDRA Query Embolic and Thrombotic events) occurred in patients with refractory and relapsed MM who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to 8.3% thrombosis in patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone. The median time to first thrombosis event was 2.8 months. In the NDMM study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis, the overall frequency of thrombotic events was 17.4% in patients in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms, and was 11.6% in the MPT Arm. The median time to first thrombosis event was 4.3 months in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms. In the AUGMENT trial, the incidence of VTE (including DVT and PE) in FL or MZL patients was 3.4% in the lenalidomide /rituximab arm [see In the AUGMENT trial, the incidence of ATE (including MI) in FL or MZL patients was 0.6% in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Thromboprophylaxis is recommended. The regimen of thromboprophylaxis should be based on an assessment of the patient's underlying risks. Instruct patients to report immediately any signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombotic events. ESAs and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their use should be based on a benefit-risk decision in patients receiving lenalidomide [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 5.5 Increased Mortality in Patients with CLL In a prospective randomized (1:1) clinical trial in the first line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, single agent lenalidomide therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single agent chlorambucil. In an interim analysis, there were 34 deaths among 210 patients on the lenalidomide treatment arm compared to 18 deaths among 211 patients in the chlorambucil treatment arm, and hazard ratio for overall survival was 1.92 [95% CI: 1.08 to 3.41], consistent with a 92% increase in the risk of death. The trial was halted for safety in July 2013. Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide treatment arm. Lenalidomide is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials. 5.6 Second Primary Malignancies In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving lenalidomide, an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor second primary malignancies (SPM) notably AML and MDS have been observed. An increase in hematologic SPM including AML and MDS occurred in 5.3% of patients with NDMM receiving lenalidomide in combination with oral melphalan compared with 1.3% of patients receiving melphalan without lenalidomide. The frequency of AML and MDS cases in patients with NDMM treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone without melphalan was 0.4%. In patients receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy following high dose intravenous melphalan and auto-HSCT, hematologic SPM occurred in 7.5% of patients compared to 3.3% in patients receiving placebo. The incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor (excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) SPM was 14.9%, compared to 8.8% in patients receiving placebo with a median follow-up of 91.5 months. Non-melanoma skin cancer SPM, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, occurred in 3.9% of patients receiving lenalidomide maintenance, compared to 2.6% in the placebo arm. In patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, the incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor (excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma) SPM was 2.3% versus 0.6% in the dexamethasone alone arm. Non-melanoma skin cancer SPM, including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, occurred in 3.1% of patients receiving lenalidomide/dexamethasone, compared to 0.6% in the dexamethasone alone arm. Patients who received lenalidomide-containing therapy until disease progression did not show a higher incidence of invasive SPM than patients treated in the fixed duration lenalidomide-containing arms. Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. Take into account both the potential benefit of lenalidomide and the risk of second primary malignancies when considering treatment with lenalidomide. In the AUGMENT trial with FL or MZL patients receiving lenalidomide/rituximab therapy, hematologic plus solid tumor SPMs, notably AML, have been observed. In the AUGMENT trial, hematologic SPM of AML occurred in 0.6% of patients with FL or MZL receiving lenalidomide /rituximab therapy. The incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor SPMs (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) was 1.7% in the lenalidomide /rituximab arm with a median follow-up of 29.8 months (range 0.5 to 51.3 months) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies. Take into account both the potential benefit of lenalidomide and the risk of second primary malignancies when considering treatment with lenalidomide. 5.7 Increased Mortality in Patients with MM When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. 5.8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure, including fatal cases, has occurred in patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone. In clinical trials, 15% of patients experienced hepatotoxicity (with hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed characteristics); 2% of patients with MM and 1% of patients with myelodysplasia had serious hepatotoxicity events. The mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity is unknown. Pre-existing viral liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concomitant medications may be risk factors. Monitor liver enzymes periodically. Stop lenalidomide upon elevation of liver enzymes. After return to baseline values, treatment at a lower dose may be considered. 5.9 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. These events can be fatal. Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide. Consider lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation for Grade 2 to 3 skin rash. Permanently discontinue lenalidomide for Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash, or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS, TEN or DRESS [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.5) 5.10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Fatal instances of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. The patients at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Monitor patients at risk closely and take appropriate preventive approaches. In the AUGMENT trial in FL or MZL patients, TLS occurred in 2 patients (1.1%) in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm. TLS occurred in 1 patient (0.5%) in the MAGNIFY trial during the lenalidomide /rituximab induction period; the event was a serious, Grade 3 adverse reaction. 5.11 Tumor Flare Reaction Tumor flare reaction (TFR), including fatal reactions, have occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide for CLL and lymphoma, and is characterized by tender lymph node swelling, low grade fever, pain and rash. Lenalidomide is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials. Monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended in patients with MCL, FL, or MZL. Tumor flare reaction may mimic progression of disease (PD). In the MCL trial, 13/134 (10%) of subjects experienced TFR; all reports were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. All of the events occurred in Cycle 1 and one patient developed TFR again in Cycle 11. In the AUGMENT trial in FL or MZL patients, TFR was reported in 19/176 (10.8%) of patients in lenalidomide with rituximab arm; one patient in the lenalidomide /rituximab arm experienced a Grade 3 TFR. In the MAGNIFY trial, 9/222 (4.1%) of patients experienced TFR; all reports were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and 1 event was considered as serious. In a separate MCL phase 2 trial, one case of TFR resulted in a fatal outcome. Lenalidomide may be continued in patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR without interruption or modification, at the physician's discretion. Patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR may also be treated with corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR symptoms. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, it is recommended to withhold treatment with lenalidomide until TFR resolves to \u2264 Grade 1. Patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR may be treated for management of symptoms per the guidance for treatment of Grade 1 and 2 TFR. 5.12 Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization A decrease in the number of CD34+ cells collected after treatment (> 4 cycles) with lenalidomide has been reported. In patients who are auto-HSCT candidates, referral to a transplant center should occur early in treatment to optimize the timing of the stem cell collection. In patients who received more than 4 cycles of a lenalidomide-containing treatment or for whom inadequate numbers of CD 34+ cells have been collected with G-CSF alone, G-CSF with cyclophosphamide or the combination of G-CSF with a CXCR4 inhibitor may be considered. 5.13 Thyroid Disorders Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported [see . Measure thyroid function before start of lenalidomide treatment and during therapy. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.14 Early Mortality in Patients with MCL In another MCL study, there was an increase in early deaths (within 20 weeks), 12.9% in the lenalidomide arm versus 7.1% in the control arm. On exploratory multivariate analysis, risk factors for early deaths include high tumor burden, MIPI score at diagnosis, and high WBC at baseline (\u2265 10 x 10 9 /L). 5.15 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and anaphylactic reactions to lenalidomide has been reported. Permanently discontinue lenalidomide for angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ].",

Newly Diagnosed MM \u2013 Lenalidomide Combination Therapy: Data were evaluated from 1613 patients in a large phase 3 study who received at least one dose of lenalidomide with low dose dexamethasone (Rd) given for 2 different durations of time (i.e., until progressive disease [Arm Rd Continuous; N=532] or for up to eighteen 28-day cycles [72 weeks, Arm Rd18; N=540] or who received melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (Arm MPT; N=541) for a maximum of twelve 42-day cycles (72 weeks). The median treatment duration in the Rd Continuous arm was 80.2 weeks (range 0.7 to 246.7) or 18.4 months (range 0.16 to 56.7). In general, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were comparable in Arm Rd Continuous and Arm Rd18, and included diarrhea, anemia, constipation, peripheral edema, neutropenia, fatigue, back pain, nausea, asthenia, and insomnia. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, asthenia, fatigue, back pain, hypokalemia, rash, cataract, lymphopenia, dyspnea, DVT, hyperglycemia, and leukopenia. The highest frequency of infections occurred in Arm Rd Continuous (75%) compared to Arm MPT (56%). There were more grade 3 and 4 and serious adverse reactions of infection in Arm Rd Continuous than either Arm MPT or Rd18. In the Rd Continuous arm, the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption of lenalidomide were infection events (28.8%); overall, the median time to the first dose interruption of lenalidomide was 7 weeks. The most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of lenalidomide in the Rd Continuous arm were hematologic events (10.7%); overall, the median time to the first dose reduction of lenalidomide was 16 weeks. In the Rd Continuous arm, the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of lenalidomide were infection events (3.4%). In both Rd arms, the frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment, except for cataracts. The frequency of onset of cataracts increased over time with 0.7% during the first 6 months and up to 9.6% by the 2nd year of treatment with Rd Continuous.

Diagnosed MM - Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Following Auto-HSCT : Data were evaluated from 1018 patients in two randomized trials who received at least one dose of lenalidomide 10 mg daily as maintenance therapy after auto-HSCT until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The mean treatment duration for lenalidomide treatment was 30.3 months for Maintenance Study 1 and 24.0 months for Maintenance Study 2 (overall range across both studies from 0.1 to 108 months). As of the cut-off date of 1 Mar 2015, 48 patients (21%) in the Maintenance Study 1 lenalidomide arm were still on treatment and none of the patients in the Maintenance Study 2 lenalidomide arm were still on treatment at the same cut-off date The adverse reactions listed from Maintenance Study 1 included events reported post-transplant (completion of high-dose melphalan /auto-HSCT), and the maintenance treatment period. In Maintenance Study 2, the adverse reactions were from the maintenance treatment period only. In general, the most frequently reported adverse reactions (more than 20% in the lenalidomide arm) across both studies were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, cough, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, rash, fatigue, asthenia, muscle spasm and pyrexia. The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions (more than 20% in the lenalidomide arm) included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The serious adverse reactions lung infection and neutropenia (more than 4.5%) occurred in the lenalidomide arm. For lenalidomide, the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were hematologic events (29.7%, data available in Maintenance Study 2 only). The most common adverse reaction leading to dose reduction of lenalidomide were hematologic events (17.7%, data available in Maintenance Study 2 only). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of lenalidomide were thrombocytopenia (2.7%) in Maintenance Study 1 and neutropenia (2.4%) in Maintenance Study 2. The frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions reported for the lenalidomide and placebo maintenance treatment arms.

Median duration of exposure among patients treated with lenalidomide/dexamethasone was 44 weeks while median duration of exposure among patients treated with placebo/dexamethasone was 23 weeks. This should be taken into consideration when comparing frequency of adverse reactions between two treatment groups lenalidomide/dexamethasone vs. placebo/dexamethasone. Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism [ s ee Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] VTE and ATE are increased in patients treated with lenalidomide. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was reported as a serious (7.4%) or severe (8.2%) adverse drug reaction at a higher rate in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group compared to 3.1 % and 3.4% in the placebo/dexamethasone group, respectively in the 2 studies in patients with at least 1 prior therapy with discontinuations due to DVT adverse reactions reported at comparable rates between groups. In the NDMM study, DVT was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 10.3%, 7.2%, 4.1%), as a serious adverse reaction (3.6%, 2.0%, 1.7%), and as a Grade 3/4 adverse reaction (5.6%, 3.7%, 2.8%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. Discontinuations and dose reductions due to DVT adverse reactions were reported at comparable rates between the Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms (both <1%). Interruption of lenalidomide treatment due to DVT adverse reactions was reported at comparable rates between the Rd Continuous (2.3%) and Rd18 (1.5%) arms. Pulmonary embolism (PE) was reported as a serious adverse drug reaction (3.7%) or Grade 3/4 (4.0%) at a higher rate in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group compared to 0.9% (serious or grade 3/4) in the placebo/dexamethasone group in the 2 studies in patients with, at least 1 prior therapy, with discontinuations due to PE adverse reactions reported at comparable rates between groups. In the NDMM study, the frequency of adverse reactions of PE was similar between the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms for adverse reactions (all grades: 3.9%, 3.3%, and 4.3%, respectively), serious adverse reactions (3.8%, 2.8%, and 3.7%, respectively), and grade 3/4 adverse reactions (3.8%, 3.0%, and 3.7%, respectively). Myocardial infarction was reported as a serious (1.7%) or severe (1.7%) adverse drug reaction at a higher rate in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group compared to 0.6 % and 0.6% respectively in the placebo/dexamethasone group. Discontinuation due to MI (including acute) adverse reactions was 0.8% in lenalidomide/dexamethasone group and none in the placebo/dexamethasone group. In the NDMM study, myocardial infarction (including acute) was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 2.4%, 0.6%, and 1.1%), as a serious adverse reaction, (2.3%, 0.6%, and 1.1%), or as a severe adverse reaction (1.9%, 0.6%, and 0.9%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT Arms, respectively. Stroke (CVA) was reported as a serious (2.3%) or severe (2.0%) adverse drug reaction in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone group compared to 0.9% and 0.9% respectively in the placebo/dexamethasone group. Discontinuation due to stroke (CVA) was 1.4% in lenalidomide/ dexamethasone group and 0.3% in the placebo/dexamethasone group. In the NDMM study, CVA was reported as an adverse reaction (all grades: 0.8%, 0.6%, and 0.6%), as a serious adverse reaction (0.8%, 0.6 %, and 0.6%), or as a severe adverse reaction (0.6%, 0.6%, 0.2%) in the Rd Continuous, Rd18, and MPT arms respectively. Other Adverse Reactions: After At Least One Prior Therapy for MM In these 2 studies, the following adverse drug reactions (ADRs) not described above that occurred at \u22651% rate and of at least twice of the placebo percentage rate were reported: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: pancytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia Cardiac disorders: bradycardia, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris Endocrine disorders: hirsutism Eye disorders: blindness, ocular hypertension Gastrointestinal disorders: gastrointestinal hemorrhage, glossodynia General disorders and administration site conditions: malaise Investigations: liver function tests abnormal, alanine aminotransferase increased Nervous system disorders: cerebral ischemia Psychiatric disorders: mood swings, hallucination, loss of libido Reproductive system and breast disorders: erectile dysfunction Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: cough, hoarseness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: exanthem, skin hyperpigmentation Myelodysplastic Syndromes: A total of 148 patients received at least 1 dose of 10 mg lenalidomide in the del 5q MDS clinical study. At least one adverse reaction was reported in all of the 148 patients who were treated with the 10 mg starting dose of lenalidomide. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were related to blood and lymphatic system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and general disorders and administrative site conditions . Thrombocytopenia (61.5%; 91/148) and neutropenia (58.8%; 87/148) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions. The next most common adverse reactions observed were diarrhea (48.6%; 72/148), pruritus (41.9%; 62/148), rash (35.8%; 53/148) and fatigue (31.1%; 46/148). Table 9 summarizes the adverse reactions that were reported in \u2265 5% of the lenalidomide treated patients in the del 5q MDS clinical study. Table 10 summarizes the most frequently observed Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse reactions regardless of relationship to treatment with lenalidomide. In the single-arm studies conducted, it is often not possible to distinguish adverse reactions that are drug-related and those that reflect the patient's underlying disease.

Subjects were 18 years or older in age, had an ECOG PS \u22642, ANC \u22651,000 cells/mm 3 and platelets\u2265 75,000/mm 3 (unless secondary to bone marrow involvement by lymphoma), hemoglobin \u22658g/dL, AST and ALT \u2264 3x ULN (unless documented liver involvement with lymphoma, and creatinine clearance of \u2265 30mL/min. Subjects with active HIV, hepatitis B or C were not eligible. In the AUGMENT trial, patients received lenalidomide 20 mg daily by mouth on days 1 to 21 of each 28 day cycle with rituximab 375 mg/m 2 weekly (days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in cycle 1) then on day 1 of cycles 2 to 5 (n=176) or placebo with rituximab 375 mg/m 2 weekly (days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in cycle 1) then on day 1 of cycles 2 to 5 (n=180) for up to 12 cycles. In the MAGNIFY trial, patients received lenalidomide 20 mg by mouth daily, days 1 to 21 of each 28 day cycle with rituximab 375 mg/m 2 weekly (days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in cycle 1) then on day 1 of cycles 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 in the induction phase of the trial (n=222). In the AUGMENT trial, 88.1% of patients completed at least 6 cycles of lenalidomide /rituximab, and 71% of patients completed 12 cycles. In the ongoing MAGNIFY trial as of May 1, 2017, 62.2% of patients completed at least 6 cycles of lenalidomide /rituximab, and 30.6% of patients completed 12 cycles. Across both clinical trials (AUGMENT and MAGNIFY), patients had a median age of 64.5 years (26 to 91); 49% were male; and 81% were White. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6 patients (1.5%) receiving lenalidomide/rituximab. Fatal adverse reactions (1 each) included cardio-respiratory arrest, arrhythmia, cardiopulmonary failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients receiving lenalidomide /rituximab in AUGMENT and 29% in MAGNIFY. The most frequent serious adverse reaction that occurred in \u2265 2.5% of patients in the lenalidomide /rituximab arm was febrile neutropenia (3%). Permanent discontinuation of lenalidomide or rituximab due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14.6% of patients in the lenalidomide /rituximab arm. The most common adverse reaction (in at least 1%) requiring permanent discontinuation of lenalidomide or rituximab was neutropenia (4.8%). The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of subjects were; neutropenia (48%), fatigue (37%), diarrhea (32%), constipation (27%), nausea (21%), and cough (20%).
