    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Monitor patients for suicidal behavior and ideation ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Lacosamide may cause dizziness and ataxia ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities: Obtaining ECG before beginning and after titration to steady-state maintenance is recommended in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions or on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction; closely monitor these patients ( 5.3 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Lacosamide may cause syncope ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Lacosamide should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) /Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity: Discontinue if no alternate etiology ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , including lacosamide, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials ( mono- and adjunctive therapy ) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk ( adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7 ) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27.863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% , compared to 0.24% among 16.029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number of events is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age ( 5 to 100 years ) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 3: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1.000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1.000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1.000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar. Anyone considering prescribing lacosamide or any other AED must balance this risk with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which antiepileptics are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. 5.2 Dizziness and Ataxia Lacosamide may cause dizziness and ataxia in adult and pediatric patients. In adult patients with partial-onset seizures taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs, dizziness was experienced by 25% of patients randomized to the recommended doses ( 200 to 400 mg/day ) of lacosamide ( compared with 8% of placebo patients ) and was the adverse reaction most frequently leading to discontinuation ( 3% ) . Ataxia was experienced by 6% of patients randomized to the recommended doses ( 200 to 400 mg/day ) of lacosamide ( compared to 2% of placebo patients ) . The onset of dizziness and ataxia was most commonly observed during titration. There was a substantial increase in these adverse reactions at doses higher than 400 mg/day [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . If a loading dose is clinically indicated, administer with medical supervision because of the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness and ataxia. 5.3 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities PR Interval Prolongation, Atrioventricular Block, and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Dose-dependent prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies in adult patients and in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . In adjunctive clinical trials in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, asymptomatic first-degree atrioventricular ( AV ) block was observed as an adverse reaction in 0.4% ( 4/944 ) of patients randomized to receive lacosamide and 0% ( 0/364 ) of patients randomized to receive placebo. One case of profound bradycardia was observed in a patient during a 15-minute infusion of 150 mg lacosamide. When lacosamide is given with other drugs that prolong the PR interval, further PR prolongation is possible. 12.2 ) ] In the postmarketing setting, there have been reports of cardiac arrhythmias in patients treated with lacosamide, including bradycardia, AV block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which have rarely resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Most, although not all, cases have occurred in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions, or in those taking concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction or prolong the PR interval. These events have occurred with both oral and intravenous routes of administration and at prescribed doses as well as in the setting of overdose [see Overdosage ( . In all patients for whom a loading dose is clinically indicated, administer the loading dose with medical supervision because of the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including cardiovascular adverse reactions. 10 ) ] Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems ( e.g. , marked first-degree AV block, second-degree or higher AV block and sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker ) , severe cardiac disease ( such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease ) , and cardiac sodium channelopathies ( e.g. , Brugada Syndrome ) . Lacosamide should also be used with caution in patients on concomitant medications that affect cardiac conduction, including sodium channel blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and medications that prolong the PR interval [see Drug Interactions ( . In such patients, obtaining an ECG before beginning lacosamide, and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state maintenance dose, is recommended. In addition, these patients should be closely monitored if they are administered lacosamide through the intravenous route 7.2 ) ] [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] . Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter In the short-term investigational trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experience. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with lacosamide experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Lacosamide administration may predispose to atrial arrhythmias ( atrial fibrillation or flutter ) , especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease. 5.4 Syncope In the short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures with no significant system illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. In the short-term controlled trials in adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 1.2% of patients who were treated with lacosamide reported an adverse reaction of syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients with diabetic neuropathy. Most of the cases of syncope were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. The cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, several were associated with either changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation ( and associated tachycardia ) , or bradycardia. Cases of syncope have also been observed in open-label clinical partial-onset seizure studies in adult and pediatric patients. These cases were associated with a history of risk factors for cardiac disease and the use of drugs that slow AV conduction. 5.5 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs ( AEDs ) As with all AEDs, lacosamide should be withdrawn gradually ( over a minimum of 1 week ) to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders. 5.6 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) /Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) , also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including lacosamide. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity ( e.g. , fever, lymphadenopathy ) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Lacosamide should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.7 Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful in patients with phenylketonuria ( PKU ) . Lacosamide oral solution contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. A 200 mg dose of lacosamide oral solution ( equivalent to 20 mL ) contains 0.32 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing lacosamide oral solution to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including lacosamide oral solution.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Dizziness and Ataxia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Syncope [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) /Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] \u2022 Adjunctive therapy: Most common adverse reactions in adults ( \u226510% and greater than placebo ) are diplopia, headache, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Monotherapy: Most common adverse reactions are similar to those seen in adjunctive therapy studies ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Pediatric patients: Adverse reactions are similar to those seen in adult patients ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hetero Labs Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Lacosamide Oral Solution in Adults In the premarketing development of adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures, 1.327 adult patients received lacosamide tablets in controlled and uncontrolled trials, of whom 1.000 were treated for longer than 6 months, and 852 for longer than 12 months. The monotherapy development program for partial-onset seizures included 425 adult patients, 310 of whom were treated for longer than 6 months, and 254 for longer than 12 months. Partial-Onset Seizures Monotherapy Historical-Control Trial ( Study 1 ) In the monotherapy trial for partial-onset seizures, 16% of patients randomized to receive lacosamide at the recommended doses of 300 and 400 mg/day discontinued from the trial as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reaction most commonly ( \u22651% on lacosamide ) leading to discontinuation was dizziness. Adverse reactions that occurred in this study were generally similar to those that occurred in adjunctive placebo-controlled studies. One adverse reaction, insomnia, occurred at a rate of \u22652% and was not reported at a similar rate in previous studies. This adverse reaction has also been observed in postmarketing experience [see Adverse Reactions ( . Because this study did not include a placebo control group, causality could not be established. 6.2 ) ] Dizziness, headache, nausea, somnolence, and fatigue all occurred at lower incidences during the AED Withdrawal Phase and Monotherapy Phase, compared with the Titration Phase [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . Adjunctive Therapy Controlled Trials ( Studies 2, 3, and 4 ) In adjunctive therapy controlled clinical trials for partial-onset seizures, the rate of discontinuation as a result of an adverse reaction was 8% and 17% in patients randomized to receive lacosamide at the recommended doses of 200 and 400 mg/day, respectively, 29% at 600 mg/day ( 1.5 times greater than the maximum recommended dose ) , and 5% in patients randomized to receive placebo. The adverse reactions most commonly ( >1% on lacosamide and greater than placebo ) leading to discontinuation were dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, diplopia, nausea, vertigo, and blurred vision. Table 4 gives the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of adult patients with partial-onset seizures in the lacosamide total group and for which the incidence was greater than placebo. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Incidence in Adjunctive Therapy Pooled, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adult Patients with Partial-Onset Seizures ( Studies 2, 3, and 4 ) Adverse Reaction Placebo N=364 % Lacosamide 200 mg/day N=270 % Lacosamide 400 mg/day N=471 % Lacosamide 600 mg/day* N=203 % Lacosamide Total N=944 % Ear and labyrinth disorder Vertigo 1 5 3 4 4 Eye disorders Diplopia 2 6 10 16 11 Blurred Vision 3 2 9 16 8 Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea 4 7 11 17 11 Vomiting 3 6 9 16 9 Diarrhea 3 3 5 4 4 General disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue 6 7 7 15 9 Gait disturbance <1 <1 2 4 2 Asthenia 1 2 2 4 2 Injury, poisoning and procedural complications Contusion 3 3 4 2 3 Skin laceration 2 2 3 3 3 Nervous system disorders Dizziness 8 16 30 53 31 Headache 9 11 14 12 13 Ataxia 2 4 7 15 8 Somnolence 5 5 8 8 7 Tremor 4 4 6 12 7 Nystagmus 4 2 5 10 5 Balance disorder 0 1 5 6 4 Memory impairment 2 1 2 6 2 Psychiatric disorders Depression 1 2 2 2 2 Skin and subcutaneous disorders Pruritus 1 3 2 3 2 * 600 mg dose is 1.5 times greater than the maximum recommended dose. The overall adverse reaction rate was similar in male and female patients. Although there were few non-Caucasian patients, no differences in the incidences of adverse reactions compared to Caucasian patients were observed. Lacosamide Oral Solution in Pediatric Patients Safety of lacosamide was evaluated in clinical studies of pediatric patients 1 month to less than 17 years of age for the treatment of partial-onset seizures. Across studies in pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures, 847 patients 1 month to less than 17 years of age received lacosamide oral solution or tablet, of whom 596 received lacosamide for at least 1 year. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients 1 month to less than 17 years of age were similar to those seen in adult patients. Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures in Patients ( 4 Years of Age and Older ) Adjunctive Therapy Trial ( Study 5 ) In the adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled trial for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, adverse reactions that occurred in the study were generally similar to those that occurred in partial-onset seizure placebo-controlled studies. The most common adverse reactions ( \u2265 10% on lacosamide ) reported in patients treated with lacosamide were dizziness ( 23% ) , somnolence ( 17% ) , headache ( 14% ) , and nausea ( 10% ) , compared to 7% , 14% , 10% , and 6% , respectively, of patients who received placebo. Additionally, an adverse reaction not previously reported of myoclonic epilepsy was reported in 3% of patients treated with lacosamide compared to 1% of patients who received placebo. It is also noted that 2 patients receiving lacosamide had acute worsening of seizures shortly after drug initiation, including one episode of status epilepticus, compared to no patients receiving placebo. Laboratory Abnormalities Abnormalities in liver function tests have occurred in controlled trials with lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures who were taking 1 to 3 concomitant anti-epileptic drugs. Elevations of ALT to \u22653\u00d7 ULN occurred in 0.7% ( 7/935 ) of lacosamide patients and 0% ( 0/356 ) of placebo patients. One case of hepatitis with transaminases >20 x ULN occurred in one healthy subject 10 days after lacosamide treatment completion, along with nephritis ( proteinuria and urine casts ) . Serologic studies were negative for viral hepatitis. Transaminases returned to normal within one month without specific treatment. At the time of this event, bilirubin was normal. The hepatitis/nephritis was interpreted as a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to lacosamide. Other Adverse Reactions The following is a list of adverse reactions reported by patients treated with lacosamide in all clinical trials in adult patients, including controlled trials and long-term open-label extension trials. Adverse reactions addressed in other tables or sections are not listed here. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: neutropenia, anemia Cardiac disorders: palpitations Ear and labyrinth disorders: tinnitus Gastrointestinal disorders: constipation, dyspepsia, dry mouth, oral hypoaesthesia General disorders and administration site conditions: irritability, pyrexia, feeling drunk Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: fall Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms Nervous system disorders: paresthesia, cognitive disorder, hypoaesthesia, dysarthria, disturbance in attention, cerebellar syndrome Psychiatric disorders: confusional state, mood altered, depressed mood 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lacosamide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Agranulocytosis Psychiatric disorders: Aggression, agitation, hallucination, insomnia, psychotic disorder Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Angioedema, rash, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis. Neurologic disorders: Dyskinesia, new or worsening seizures",
