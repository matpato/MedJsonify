    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Residual Paralysis : Patients with neuromuscular diseases are at higher risk. Use a lower initial bolus dose and consider using a reversal agent in these patients. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol : Consider combined daily load of benzyl alcohol from all sources when the 10 mL multiple dose vials are used in infants ( 4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Risk of Seizure : Monitor level of neuromuscular blockade during long-term administration to limit exposure to toxic metabolites ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions and Anaphylaxis : Severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Consider cross-reactivity among neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing. ( 4 , 5.4 ) \u2022 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Accidental administration can cause death. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Inadequate Anesthesia : Use Cisatracurium Besylate Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia and monitor patients to ensure level of anesthesia is adequate ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Residual Paralysis Cisatracurium Besylate Injection has been associated with residual paralysis. Patients with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis and myasthenic syndrome) and carcinomatosis may be at higher risk of residual paralysis; thus, a lower maximum initial bolus is recommended in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( . To prevent complications resulting from Cisatracurium Besylate Injection-associated residual paralysis, extubation is recommended only after the patient has recovered sufficiently from neuromuscular blockade. Consider use of a reversal agent especially in cases where residual paralysis is more likely to occur 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.10 )] [see Overdosage ( . 10 )] 5.2 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative in 10 mL Multiple-Dose Vials Serious and fatal adverse reactions including \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d can occur in neonates and infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Cisatracurium Besylate Injection (10 mL multiple-dose vials). This warning is not applicable to the 5 mL and 20 mL Cisatracurium Besylate Injection single-dose vials because these vials do not contain benzyl alcohol. The \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. When prescribing the 10 mL multiple-dose Cisatracurium Besylate Injection vials in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Cisatracurium Besylate Injection (multiple-dose vials contain 9 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL) and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] The use of 10 mL Cisatracurium Besylate Injection multiple-dose vials is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 1 month of age and low birth-weight infants because these patients are more likely to develop benzyl alcohol toxicity [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.3 Risk of Seizure Laudanosine, an active metabolite of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection, has been shown to cause seizures in animals. Cisatracurium Besylate Injection-treated patients with renal or hepatic impairment may have higher metabolite concentrations (including laudanosine) than patients with normal renal and hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Therefore, patients with renal or hepatic impairment receiving extended administration of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection may be at higher risk of seizures. 12.3 )] The level of neuromuscular blockade during long-term Cisatracurium Besylate Injection administration should be monitored with a nerve stimulator to titrate Cisatracurium Besylate Injection administration to the patients\u2019 needs and limit exposure to toxic metabolites. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal and life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, have been reported [see Contraindications ( . There have been reports of wheezing, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, rash and itching following Cisatracurium Besylate Injection administration in pediatric patients. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, appropriate precautions such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those patients who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported. 4 )] 5.5 Risk of Death Due to Medication Errors Administration of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death, a progression that may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.6 Risks Due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use Cisatracurium Besylate Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. 5.7 Risk for Infection The 20 mL vial of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection is intended only for administration as an infusion for use in a single patient in the ICU. The 20 mL vial should not be used multiple times because there is a higher risk of infection (the 20 mL vial does not contain a preservative). 5.8 Potentiation of Neuromuscular Blockade Certain drugs may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of Cisatracurium Besylate Injection including inhalational anesthetics, antibiotics, magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide and quinidine [see Drug Interactions ( . Additionally, acid-base and/or serum electrolyte abnormalities may potentiate the action of neuromuscular blocking agents. Use peripheral nerve stimulation and monitor the clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade to determine the adequacy of the level of neuromuscular blockage and the need to adjust the Cisatracurium Besylate Injection dosage. 7.1 )] 5.9 Resistance to Neuromuscular Blockade with Certain Drugs Shorter durations of neuromuscular block may occur and Cisatracurium Besylate Injection infusion rate requirements may be higher in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine [see Drug Interactions ( . Use peripheral nerve stimulation and monitor the clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade to determine the adequacy of neuromuscular blockage and the need to adjust the Cisatracurium Besylate Injection dosage. 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.10 Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) Cisatracurium Besylate Injection has not been studied in MH-susceptible patients. Because MH can develop in the absence of established triggering agents, the clinician should be prepared to recognize and treat MH in any patient undergoing general anesthesia.",

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to Cisatracurium Besylate Injection: anaphylaxis, histamine release, prolonged neuromuscular block, muscle weakness, myopathy.",
