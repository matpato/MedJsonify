    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets dosage. Chinese patients may be at higher risk for myopathy. Discontinue ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. ( 5.1 ) Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported. Discontinue ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets if IMNM is suspected. ( 5.2 ) Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzyme before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets may cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets. In clinical trials of 24,747 simvastatin-treated patients with a median follow-up of 4 years, the incidence of myopathy, defined as unexplained muscle weakness, pain, or tenderness accompanied by creatinine kinase (CK) increases greater than ten times the upper limit of normal (10 X ULN), were approximately 0.03%, 0.08%, and 0.61% in patients treated with simvastatin 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg daily, respectively. In another clinical trial of 12,064 simvastatin-treated patients (with a history of myocardial infarction) with a mean follow-up of 6.7 years, the incidences of myopathy in patients taking simvastatin 20 mg and 80 mg daily were approximately 0.02% and 0.9%, respectively. The incidences of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK >40 X ULN) in patients taking simvastatin 20 mg and 80 mg daily were approximately 0% and 0.4%, respectively [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. In the Trial of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), 9270 patients with chronic kidney disease were allocated to receive ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg daily (n=4650) or placebo (n=4620). During a median follow-up period of 4.9 years, the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] greater than 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) was 0.2% for ezetimibe and simvastatin and 0.1% for placebo: the incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK greater than 40 times ULN) was 0.09% for ezetimibe and simvastatin and 0.02% for placebo. In postmarketing experience with ezetimibe, cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin prior to initiating ezetimibe. However, rhabdomyolysis has been reported with ezetimibe monotherapy and with the addition of ezetimibe to agents known to be associated with increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, such as fibric acid derivatives. Ezetimibe and simvastatin and a fenofibrate, if taking concomitantly, should both be immediately discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher ezetimibe and simvastatin dosage; Chinese patients on ezetimibe and simvastatin may be at higher risk for myopathy [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions ( The risk of myopathy is increased by elevated plasma levels of simvastatin and simvastatin acid. The risk is also greater in patients taking ezetimibe and simvastatin 80 mg daily compared with patients taking lower ezetimibe and simvastatin dosages and compared with patients using other statins with similar or greater LDL-C-lowering efficacy 7.1 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.8 )]. [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with ezetimibe and simvastatin are contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is required, temporarily suspend ezetimibe and simvastatin during the duration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment. The concomitant use of ezetimibe and simvastatin with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, or danazol is also contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Ezetimibe and simvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking lomitapide, verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone, amlodipine or ranolazine [see Dosage and Administration ( Ezetimibe and simvastatin use should be temporarily suspended in patients taking daptomycin. Lipid modifying doses (greater than or equal to 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and grapefruit juice may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis 2.5 )]. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Use the 80 mg daily dosage of ezetimibe and simvastatin only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg daily chronically without evidence of muscle toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( If patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin tablets 80 mg are prescribed an interacting drug that increases the risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, switch to an alternate statin 2.1 )]. [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Discontinue ezetimibe and simvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if ezetimibe and simvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue ezetimibe and simvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the ezetimibe and simvastatin dosage and advise patients receiving ezetimibe and simvastatin 80 mg of the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue ezetimibe and simvastatin if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of ezetimibe and simvastatin [see Adverse Reactions ( In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with ezetimibe and simvastatin. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including ezetimibe and simvastatin. 6.1 )]. In three placebo-controlled, 12-week trials, the incidence of consecutive elevations (greater than or equal to 3 X ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.7% overall for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin and appeared to be dose-related with an incidence of 2.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/80 mg. In controlled long-term (48-\u00adweek) extensions, which included both newly-treated and previously-treated patients, the incidence of consecutive elevations (greater than or equal to 3 X ULN) in serum transaminases was 1.8% overall and 3.6% for patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/80 mg. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, not associated with cholestasis, and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment. In SHARP, 9270 patients with chronic kidney disease were allocated to receive ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg daily (n=4650), or placebo (n=4620). During a median follow-up period of 4.9 years, the incidence of consecutive elevations of transaminases (greater than 3 X ULN) was 0.7% for ezetimibe and simvastatin and 0.6% for placebo. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury. Consider liver enzyme testing before ezetimibe and simvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Ezetimibe and simvastatin are contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications ( If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue ezetimibe and simvastatin. 4 )]. 5.4 Increases in HBA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including ezetimibe and simvastatin. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Common (incidence greater than or equal to 2% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions in clinical trials: headache, increased ALT, myalgia, upper respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea.

Ezetimibe and Simvastatin In the ezetimibe and simvastatin placebo-controlled clinical trials database of 1420 patients (age range 20 to 83 years, 52% female, 87% White, 3% Black or African American, 3% Asians, 5% other races identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity) with a median treatment duration of 27 weeks, 5% of patients on ezetimibe and simvastatin and 2.2% of patients on placebo discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence \u22652% and greater than placebo) in controlled clinical trials were: headache (5.8%), increased ALT (3.7%), myalgia (3.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.6%), and diarrhea (2.8%). The most common adverse reactions in the group treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: increased ALT (0.9%), myalgia (0.6%), increased AST (0.4%), and back pain (0.4%). Ezetimibe and simvastatin have been evaluated for safety in more than 10,189 patients in clinical trials. Table 1 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients treated with ezetimibe and simvastatin (n=1420) and at an incidence greater than placebo from four placebo-controlled trials. Table 1*: Adverse Reactions Reported greater than or equal to 2% of Patients Treated with Ezetimibe and Simvastatin at an Incidence Greater than Placebo Regardless of Causality % Placebo N=371 % Ezetimibe 10 mg N=302 % Simvastatin \u2020 N=1234 % Ezetimibe and Simvastatin \u2020 N=1420 Headache 5.4 6.0 5.9 5.8 Upper respiratory tract infection 2.7 5.0 5.0 3.6 Myalgia 2.4 2.3 2.6 3.6 Diarrhea 2.2 5.0 3.7 2.8 Pain in extremity 1.3 3.0 2.0 2.3 Influenza 0.8 1.0 1.9 2.3 * Includes two placebo-controlled combination studies in which the active ingredients equivalent to ezetimibe and simvastatin were coadministered and two placebo-controlled studies in which ezetimibe and simvastatin was administered. \u2020All doses. Study of Heart and Renal Protection In SHARP, 9270 patients were allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin 10 mg/20 mg daily (n=4650) or placebo (n=4620) for a median follow-up period of 4.9 years. The proportion of patients who permanently discontinued trial treatment as a result of either an adverse event or abnormal safety blood result was 10.4% vs. 9.8% among patients allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo, respectively. Comparing those allocated to ezetimibe and simvastatin vs. placebo, the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum CK greater than 10 times ULN) was 0.2% vs. 0.1% and the incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK greater than 40 times ULN) was 0.09% vs. 0.02%, respectively. Consecutive elevations of transaminases (greater than 3 X ULN) occurred in 0.7% vs. 0.6%, respectively. Patients were asked about the occurrence of unexplained muscle pain or weakness at each trial visit: 21.5% vs. 20.9% patients ever reported muscle symptoms in the ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo groups, respectively. Cancer was diagnosed during the trial in 9.4% vs. 9.5% of patients assigned to ezetimibe and simvastatin and placebo, respectively. Ezetimibe Other adverse reactions reported with ezetimibe in placebo-controlled studies, regardless of causality assessment: Musculoskeletal system disorders: arthralgia; Infections and infestations: sinusitis; Body as a whole \u2013 general disorders: fatigue. Simvastatin In a clinical outcome trial in which 12,064 adult patients with a history of myocardial infarction were treated with simvastatin (mean follow-up 6.7 years), the incidence of myopathy (defined as unexplained muscle weakness or pain with a serum creatine kinase [CK] greater than 10 times (1200 U/L) upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients taking simvastatin 20 mg and 80 mg daily was approximately 0.02% and 0.9% respectively. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK greater than 40 times ULN) in patients taking simvastatin 20 mg and 80 mg daily was approximately 0% and 0.4%. The incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded. Other adverse reactions reported with simvastatin in placebo-controlled clinical trials: atrial fibrillation; vertigo; abdominal pain, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, gastritis; eczema, rash; diabetes mellitus; bronchitis, sinusitis, urinary tract infections; asthenia, edema/swelling; and insomnia. Laboratory Tests Marked persistent increases of hepatic serum transaminases have been noted [see Warnings and Precautions ( . Elevated alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase have been reported. About 5% of patients taking simvastatin had elevations of CK levels of 3 or more times the normal value on one or more occasions. This was attributable to the noncardiac fraction of CK 5.3 )] [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ezetimibe and simvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as Whole: fever, chills, malaise, asthenia Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, eosinophilia Gastrointestinal Disorders: pancreatitis, nausea, vomiting Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, elevations in liver transaminases including elevations more than 5 X ULN, hepatitis/jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity syndrome including: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, dermatomyositis, vasculitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: muscle cramps, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, arthralgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, arthritis, elevated creatine phosphokinase Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, depression, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. Cognitive impairment was generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash, pruritus, alopecia, a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails), purpura, lichen planus, urticaria, photosensitivity, flushing, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
