    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Infections: Do not initiate OJJAARA in patients with an active infection. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection, including reactivation of hepatitis B, and initiate appropriate treatment promptly. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Thrombocytopenia and Neutropenia: Manage by dose reduction or interruption. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Obtain liver tests before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment with OJJAARA. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE): Monitor for symptoms, evaluate and treat promptly. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Thrombosis: Evaluate and treat symptoms of thrombosis promptly. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Malignancies: Monitor for development of secondary malignancies, particularly in current or past smokers. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Risk of Infections Serious (including fatal) infections (e.g., bacterial and viral, including COVID-19) occurred in 13% of patients treated with OJJAARA. Infections regardless of grade occurred in 38% of patients treated with OJJAARA [see Adverse Reactions ( . Delay starting therapy with OJJAARA until active infections have resolved. Monitor patients receiving OJJAARA for signs and symptoms of infection and initiate appropriate treatment promptly. 6.1 )] Hepatitis B Reactivation Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titer) increases, with or without associated elevations in alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST), have been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection taking Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors, including OJJAARA. The effect of OJJAARA on viral replication in patients with chronic HBV infection is unknown. In patients with HBV infections, check hepatitis B serologies prior to starting OJJAARA. If HBsAg and/or anti-HBc antibody is positive, consider consultation with a hepatologist regarding monitoring for reactivation versus prophylactic hepatitis B therapy. Patients with chronic HBV infection who receive OJJAARA should have their chronic HBV infection treated and monitored according to clinical HBV guidelines. 5.2 Thrombocytopenia and Neutropenia OJJAARA can cause thrombocytopenia and neutropenia [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] New or worsening thrombocytopenia, with platelet count less than 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 9 /L, was observed in 20% of patients treated with OJJAARA. Eight percent of patients treated with OJJAARA had baseline platelet counts less than 50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 9 /L. Severe neutropenia, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 9 /L, was observed in 2% of patients treated with OJJAARA. Assess complete blood counts (CBC), including platelet and neutrophil counts, before initiating treatment and periodically during treatment as clinically indicated. Interrupt dosing or reduce the dose for thrombocytopenia or neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 )] 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Two of the 993 patients with MF who received at least one dose of OJJAARA in clinical trials experienced reversible drug-induced liver injury. Overall, new or worsening elevations of ALT and AST (all grades) occurred in 23% and 24%, respectively, of patients treated with OJJAARA; Grade\u00a03 and 4 transaminase elevations occurred in 1% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. New or worsening elevations of total bilirubin occurred in 16% of patients treated with OJJAARA. All total bilirubin elevations were Grades 1-2. The median time to onset of any grade transaminase elevation was 2\u00a0months, with 75% of cases occurring within 4\u00a0months. Delay starting therapy in patients presenting with uncontrolled acute and chronic liver disease until apparent causes have been investigated and treated as clinically indicated. When initiating OJJAARA, refer to dosing in patients with hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 )] Monitor liver tests at baseline, every month for 6 months during treatment, then periodically as clinically indicated. If increases in ALT, AST or bilirubin related to treatment are suspected, modify OJJAARA dosage based upon Table\u00a01 [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 )] 5.4 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) Another JAK inhibitor increased the risk of MACE, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke [compared with those treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers] in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which OJJAARA is not indicated. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OJJAARA, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Inform patients receiving OJJAARA of the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.5 Thrombosis Another JAK inhibitor increased the risk of thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thrombosis (compared with those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which OJJAARA is not indicated. Evaluate patients with symptoms of thrombosis and treat appropriately. 5.6 Malignancies Another JAK inhibitor increased the risk of lymphoma and other malignancies excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (compared with those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which OJJAARA is not indicated. Current or past smokers were at increased risk. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OJJAARA, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Risk of Infections and Hepatitis B Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia and Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u226520% in either study) are thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, bacterial infection, fatigue, dizziness, diarrhea, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of OJJAARA was evaluated in 215 patients in 2 clinical trials (MOMENTUM and SIMPLIFY-1 anemic subgroup [hemoglobin (Hb) <10\u00a0g/dL]) [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] MOMENTUM Patients in the MOMENTUM trial had been previously treated with a JAK inhibitor and were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive double-blind OJJAARA 200\u00a0mg orally once daily (n\u00a0=\u00a0130) or danazol 300\u00a0mg orally twice daily (n\u00a0=\u00a065) for 24\u00a0weeks, after which they were eligible to receive open-label OJJAARA in an extended treatment phase. Among patients who received OJJAARA, 72% were exposed for 24\u00a0weeks or longer and 52% were exposed for 48\u00a0weeks or longer [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients who received OJJAARA during the randomized treatment period of the MOMENTUM trial; the most common serious adverse reactions (\u22652%) included bacterial infection (8%), viral infection (5%), hemorrhage (4%), acute kidney injury (3%), pneumonia (3%), pyrexia (3%), thrombosis (3%), syncope (2%), thrombocytopenia (2%), and renal and urinary tract infection (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients who received OJJAARA; the most common (\u22652%) fatal adverse reaction was viral infection (5%). Permanent discontinuation of OJJAARA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 18% of patients during the randomized treatment period of the MOMENTUM trial. Adverse reactions that resulted in permanent discontinuation (\u22652%) included viral infection (2%) and thrombocytopenia (2%). Dosage reduction or treatment interruption due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reduction and/or treatment interruption (\u22652%) included thrombocytopenia (13%), bacterial infection (2%), diarrhea (2%), and neutropenia (2%). Among the 130 patients treated with OJJAARA during the randomized treatment period of MOMENTUM, the most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and fatigue ( Table\u00a02 ).

Upon completion of the double-blind treatment phase, all patients were eligible to receive OJJAARA during the open-label phase. The safety of OJJAARA was evaluated in the population of patients with MF who were anemic at study entry. SIMPLIFY-1 enrolled 180 anemic patients who received OJJAARA (n\u00a0=\u00a085) or ruxolitinib (n\u00a0=\u00a095). Among these anemic patients who received OJJAARA, 78% were exposed for 24\u00a0weeks or longer and 61% were exposed for 48\u00a0weeks or longer [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of the anemic patients who received OJJAARA during the randomized treatment period of the SIMPLIFY-1 trial; the most common serious adverse reactions (\u22652%) included bacterial infection (7%), pneumonia (6%), heart failure (4%) arrhythmia (2%), and respiratory failure (2%). A fatal adverse reaction (bacterial infection) occurred in 1 patient who received OJJAARA. Permanent discontinuation of OJJAARA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of the anemic patients during the randomized treatment period of the SIMPLIFY-1 trial. Adverse reactions that resulted in permanent discontinuation of OJJAARA (\u22652%) included bacterial infection (2%), dizziness (2%), fatigue (2%), hypotension (2%), and thrombocytopenia (2%). Dosage reductions or treatment interruptions of OJJAARA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 21% of patients. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reduction and/or treatment interruption (\u22652%) were thrombocytopenia (8%), pneumonia (4%), bacterial infection (2%), abdominal pain (2%), elevated liver enzymes (2%), and hypotension (2%). Among the 85 anemic patients treated with OJJAARA during the randomized treatment period of SIMPLIFY-1, the most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were dizziness, fatigue, bacterial infection, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and nausea ().
