    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Spinal or epidural hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis, can occur. ( 5.1 ) Patients taking fondaparinux sodium with risk factors for bleeding are at increased risk of hemorrhage. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding risk is increased in renal impairment and in patients with low body weight <50 kg. ( 5.3 , 5.4 ) Thrombocytopenia can occur with administration of fondaparinux sodium. ( 5.5 ) Periodic routine complete blood counts (including platelet counts), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood tests are recommended. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Neuraxial Anesthesia and Post-operative Indwelling Epidural Catheter Use Spinal or epidural hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis, can occur with the use of anticoagulants and neuraxial (spinal/epidural) anesthesia or spinal puncture. The risk of these events may be higher with post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or concomitant use of other drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs [see Boxed Warning] . In the postmarketing experience, epidural or spinal hematoma has been reported in association with the use of fondaparinux sodium by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Optimal timing between the administration of fondaparinux sodium and neuraxial procedures is not known. Monitor patients undergoing these procedures for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Consider the potential risks and benefits before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or who may be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis. 5.2 Hemorrhage Fondaparinux sodium increases the risk of hemorrhage in patients at risk for bleeding, including conditions such as congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery. Cases\u00a0of elevated aPTT temporally associated with bleeding events have been reported following administration of fondaparinux sodium (with or without concomitant administration of other anticoagulants) [see Adverse Reactions ]. (6.5) Do not administer agents that enhance the risk of hemorrhage with fondaparinux sodium unless essential for the management of the underlying condition, such as vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of VTE. If co-administration is essential, closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding. Do not administer the initial dose of fondaparinux sodium earlier than 6 to 8 hours after surgery. Administration earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases risk of major bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Adverse Reactions ]. (6.1) 5.3 Renal Impairment and Bleeding Risk Fondaparinux sodium increases the risk of bleeding in patients with impaired renal function due to reduced clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology ]. (12.4) The incidence of major bleeding by renal function status reported in clinical trials of patients receiving fondaparinux sodium for VTE surgical prophylaxis is provided in Table 1 . In these patient populations, the following is recommended: Do not use fondaparinux sodium for VTE prophylaxis and treatment in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min [see Contraindications ]. (4) Fondaparinux sodium may cause prolonged anticoagulation\u00a0in patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min. Table 1.

Assess renal function periodically in patients receiving fondaparinux sodium. Discontinue the drug immediately in patients who develop severe renal impairment while on therapy. After discontinuation of fondaparinux sodium, its anticoagulant effects may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function (i.e., at least 3 to 5 half-lives). The anticoagulant effects of fondaparinux sodium may persist even longer in patients with renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ]. (12.4) 5.4 Body Weight < 50 kg and Bleeding Risk Fondaparinux sodium increases the risk for bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, compared to patients with higher weights. In patients who weigh less than 50 kg: Do not administer fondaparinux sodium as prophylactic therapy for patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. During the randomized clinical trials of VTE prophylaxis in the peri-operative period following hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery, major bleeding occurred at a higher rate among patients with a body weight < 50 kg compared to those with a body weight > 50 kg (5.4% versus 2.1% in patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery; 5.3% versus 3.3% in patients undergoing abdominal surgery). 5.5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of fondaparinux sodium. Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely. Discontinue fondaparinux sodium if the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm 3 . Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm 3 and 50,000/mm 3 ) occurred at a rate of 3.0% in patients given fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg in the peri-operative hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery clinical trials. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 50,000/mm 3 ) occurred at a rate of 0.2% in patients given fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg in these clinical trials. During extended prophylaxis, no cases of moderate or severe thrombocytopenia were reported. Moderate thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.5% in patients given the fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials. Severe thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.04% in patients given the fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials. Occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia have been reported with the use of fondaparinux sodium in postmarketing experience [see Adverse Reactions ]. (6.5) 5.6 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests Routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of the activity of fondaparinux sodium and international standards of heparin or LMWH are not calibrators to measure anti-Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium. If unexpected changes in coagulation parameters or major bleeding occur during therapy with fondaparinux sodium, discontinue fondaparinux sodium. In postmarketing experience, occurrences of aPTT elevations have been reported following administration of fondaparinux sodium [see Adverse Reactions ]. (6.5) Periodic routine complete blood counts (including platelet count), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with fondaparinux sodium. The anti-Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium can be measured by anti-Xa assay using the appropriate calibrator (fondaparinux). The activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed in milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux and cannot be compared with activities of heparin or low molecular weight heparins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 , ]. 12.3)",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Spinal or epidural hematomas [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Renal impairment and bleeding risk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Body weight <50 kg and bleeding risk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most serious adverse reactions associated with the use of fondaparinux sodium are bleeding complications. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sandoz Inc. at 1-800-525-8747 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information below is based on data from 8,877 patients exposed to fondaparinux sodium in controlled trials of hip fracture, hip replacement, major knee, or abdominal surgeries, and DVT and PE treatment. Hemorrhage During administration of fondaparinux sodium, the most common adverse reactions were bleeding complications [see Warnings and Precautions ]. (5.2) Hip Fracture, Hip Replacement, and Knee Replacement Surgery The rates of major bleeding events reported during 3 active-controlled peri-operative VTE prophylaxis trials with enoxaparin sodium in hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery (N = 3,616) and in an extended VTE prophylaxis trial (n = 327) with fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg are provided in Table 2 . Table 2.

A separate analysis of major bleeding across all randomized, controlled, peri-operative, prophylaxis clinical studies of hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery according to the time of the first injection of fondaparinux sodium after surgical closure was performed in patients who received fondaparinux sodium only post-operatively. In this analysis, the incidences of major bleeding were as follows: <4 hours was 4.8% (5/104), 4 to 6 hours was 2.3% (28/1,196), 6 to 8 hours was 1.9% (38/1,965). In all studies, the majority (\u226575%) of the major bleeding events occurred during the first 4 days after surgery. Abdominal Surgery In a randomized study of patients undergoing abdominal surgery, fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg once daily (n = 1,433) was compared with dalteparin 5,000 IU once daily (n = 1,425). Bleeding rates are shown in Table 3 . Table 3. Bleeding in the Abdominal Surgery Study Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg SC once daily Dalteparin Sodium 5,000 IU SC once daily N = 1,433 N = 1,425 Major bleeding a 49 (3.4%) 34 (2.4%) Fatal bleeding 2 (0.1%) 2 (0.1%) Non-fatal bleeding at critical site 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) Other non-fatal major bleeding Surgical site Non-surgical site 38 (2.7%) 9 (0.6%) 26 (1.8%) 6 (0.4%) Minor bleeding b 31 (2.2%) 23 (1.6%) a Major bleeding was defined as bleeding that was (1) fatal, (2) bleeding at the surgical site leading to intervention, (3) non-surgical bleeding at a critical site (e.g. intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, pericardial, spinal, or into adrenal gland), or leading to an intervention, and/or with a bleeding index (BI) \u22652. b Minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was not major. The rates of major bleeding according to the time interval following the first fondaparinux sodium were as follows: <6 hours was 3.4% (9/263) and 6 to 8 hours was 2.9% (32/1112). Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism The rates of bleeding events reported during a dose-response trial (n = 111) and an active-controlled trial with enoxaparin sodium in DVT treatment (n = 1,091) and an active-controlled trial with heparin in PE treatment (n = 1,092) with fondaparinux sodium are provided in Table 4 . Table 4.

Patients were also treated with vitamin K antagonists initiated within 72 hours after the first study drug administration. b Major bleeding was defined as clinically overt: \u2013and/or contributing to death \u2013 and/or in a critical organ including intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, spinal, pericardial, or adrenal gland \u2013 and/or associated with a fall in hemoglobin level \u22652 g/dL \u2013 and/or leading to a transfusion \u22652 units of packed red blood cells or whole blood. c Clinically overt bleeding with a 2 g/dL fall in hemoglobin and/or leading to transfusion of PRBC or whole blood \u22652 units. d Minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was not major. 6.2 Local Reactions Local irritation (injection site bleeding, rash, and pruritus) may occur following subcutaneous injection of fondaparinux sodium. 6.3 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases In the peri-operative prophylaxis randomized clinical trials of 7 \u00b1 2 days, asymptomatic increases in aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal were reported in 1.7% and 2.6% of patients, respectively, during treatment with fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg once daily versus 3.2% and 3.9% of patients, respectively, during treatment with enoxaparin sodium 30 mg every 12 hours or 40 mg once daily enoxaparin sodium. These elevations are reversible and may be associated with increases in bilirubin. In the extended prophylaxis clinical trial, no significant differences in AST and ALT levels between fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg and placebo-treated patients were observed. In the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials, asymptomatic increases in AST and ALT levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal of the laboratory reference range were reported in 0.7% and 1.3% of patients, respectively, during treatment with fondaparinux sodium. In comparison, these increases were reported in 4.8% and 12.3% of patients, respectively, in the DVT treatment trial during treatment with enoxaparin sodium 1 mg/kg every 12 hours and in 2.9% and 8.7% of patients, respectively, in the PE treatment trial during treatment with aPTT adjusted heparin. Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease, and pulmonary emboli, elevations that might be caused by drugs like fondaparinux sodium should be interpreted with caution. 6.4 Other Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions that occurred during treatment with fondaparinux sodium in clinical trials with patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery are provided in Table 5 .

The most common adverse reaction in the abdominal surgery trial was post-operative wound infection (4.9%), and the most common adverse reaction in the VTE treatment trials was epistaxis (1.3%). 6.5 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fondaparinux sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. In the postmarketing experience, epidural or spinal hematoma has been reported in association with the use of fondaparinux sodium by subcutaneous (SC) injection [see Warnings and Precautions ]. Occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing experience and cases of elevated aPTT temporally associated with bleeding events have been reported following administration of fondaparinux sodium (with or without concomitant administration of other anticoagulants) [see (5.1) Warnings and Precautions ]. (5.5) Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions have been reported with the use of fondaparinux sodium [see Contraindications ]. (4)",
