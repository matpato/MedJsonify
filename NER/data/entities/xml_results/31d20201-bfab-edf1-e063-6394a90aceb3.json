Monitor for signs and symptoms of cerebrovascular disorders and ischemic heart disease. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors. ( 5.1 ). Fractures occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA. Evaluate patients for fracture risk and treat patients with bone-targeted agents according to established guidelines. ( 5.2 ) Falls occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA with increased incidence in the elderly. Evaluate patients for fall risk. ( 5.3 ) Seizure occurred in 0.4% of patients receiving ERLEADA. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. ( 5.4 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), occurred in patients treated with ERLEADA. Interrupt ERLEADA if signs or symptoms of SCARs develop. Permanently discontinue if SCARs are confirmed. ( 5.5 ) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with ERLEADA. Withhold ERLEADA for suspected ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA in patients with severe ILD/pneumonitis or if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified. ( 2.2 , 5.6 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ERLEADA can cause fetal harm. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Cerebrovascular and Ischemic Cardiovascular Events Cerebrovascular and ischemic cardiovascular events, including events leading to death, occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disorders. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Consider discontinuation of ERLEADA for Grade 3 and 4 events. In a randomized study (SPARTAN) of patients with nmCRPC, ischemic cardiovascular events occurred in 3.7% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 2% of patients treated with placebo. In a randomized study (TITAN) in patients with mCSPC, ischemic cardiovascular events occurred in 4.4% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 1.5% of patients treated with placebo. Across the SPARTAN and TITAN studies, 4 patients (0.3%) treated with ERLEADA, and 2 patients (0.2%) treated with placebo died from an ischemic cardiovascular event. In the SPARTAN study, cerebrovascular events occurred in 2.5% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 1% of patients treated with placebo [see . In the TITAN study, cerebrovascular events occurred in 1.9% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 2.1% of patients treated with placebo. Across the SPARTAN and TITAN studies, 3 patients (0.2%) treated with ERLEADA, and 2 patients (0.2%) treated with placebo died from a cerebrovascular event. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Patients with history of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, or transient ischemic attack within six months of randomization were excluded from the SPARTAN and TITAN studies. 5.2 Fractures Fractures occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA. Evaluate patients for fracture risk. Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone-targeted agents. In a randomized study (SPARTAN) of patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, fractures occurred in 12% of patients treated with ERLEADA and in 7% of patients treated with placebo. Grade 3\u20134 fractures occurred in 2.7% of patients treated with ERLEADA and in 0.8% of patients treated with placebo. The median time to onset of fracture was 314 days (range: 20 to 953 days) for patients treated with ERLEADA. Routine bone density assessment and treatment of osteoporosis with bone-targeted agents were not performed in the SPARTAN study. In a randomized study (TITAN) of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer, fractures occurred in 9% of patients treated with ERLEADA and in 6% of patients treated with placebo. Grade 3\u20134 fractures were similar in both arms at 1.5%. The median time to onset of fracture was 56 days (range: 2 to 111 days) for patients treated with ERLEADA. Routine bone density assessment and treatment of osteoporosis with bone-targeted agents were not performed in the TITAN study. 5.3 Falls Falls occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA with increased frequency in the elderly [see . Evaluate patients for fall risk. Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] In a randomized study (SPARTAN), falls occurred in 16% of patients treated with ERLEADA compared to 9% of patients treated with placebo. Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure. 5.4 Seizure Seizure occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA in patients who develop a seizure during treatment. It is unknown whether anti-epileptic medications will prevent seizures with ERLEADA. Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while receiving ERLEADA and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause harm to themselves or others. In two randomized studies (SPARTAN and TITAN), five patients (0.4%) treated with ERLEADA and one patient treated with placebo (0.1%) experienced a seizure. Seizure occurred from 159 to 650 days after initiation of ERLEADA. Patients with a history of seizure, predisposing factors for seizure, or receiving drugs known to decrease the seizure threshold or to induce seizure were excluded. There is no clinical experience in re-administering ERLEADA to patients who experienced a seizure. 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Fatal and life-threatening cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), occurred in patients receiving ERLEADA [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Monitor patients for the development of SCARs. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of SCARs (e.g., a prodrome of fever, flu-like symptoms, mucosal lesions, progressive skin rash, or lymphadenopathy). If a SCAR is suspected, interrupt ERLEADA until the etiology of the reaction has been determined. Consultation with a dermatologist is recommended. If a SCAR is confirmed, or for other grade 4 skin reactions, permanently discontinue ERLEADA [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.6 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis Fatal and life-threatening interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with ERLEADA. Post-marketing cases of ILD/pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred in patients treated with ERLEADA. Across clinical trials (TITAN and SPARTAN, n=1327), 0.8% of patients treated with ERLEADA experienced ILD/pneumonitis, including 0.2% who experienced Grade 3 events [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ]. Monitor patients for new or worsening symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold ERLEADA if ILD/pneumonitis is suspected. Permanently discontinue ERLEADA in patients with severe ILD/pneumonitis or if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of ERLEADA have not been established in females. Based on findings from animals and its mechanism of action, ERLEADA can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female. In an animal reproduction study, oral administration of apalutamide to pregnant rats during and after organogenesis resulted in fetal abnormalities and embryo-fetal lethality at maternal exposures \u2265 2 times the human clinical exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose.

Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Fractures [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Falls [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Seizure [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) are fatigue, arthralgia, rash, decreased appetite, fall, weight decreased, hypertension, hot flush, diarrhea, and fracture. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Janssen Products, LP at 1-800-526-7736 (1-800-JANSSEN) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that occurred more frequently in the ERLEADA-treated patients (\u2265 2% over placebo) from the randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (TITAN and SPARTAN) were fatigue, arthralgia, rash, decreased appetite, fall, weight decreased, hypertension, hot flush, diarrhea, and fracture. Metastatic Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer (mCSPC) TITAN, a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study, enrolled patients who had mCSPC. In this study, patients received either ERLEADA at a dose of 240 mg daily or placebo. All patients in the TITAN study received a concomitant gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy. The median duration of exposure was 20 months (range: 0 to 34 months) in patients who received ERLEADA and 18 months (range: 0.1 to 34 months) in patients who received placebo. Ten patients (1.9%) who were treated with ERLEADA died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death were ischemic cardiovascular events (n=3), acute kidney injury (n=2), cardio-respiratory arrest (n=1), sudden cardiac death (n=1), respiratory failure (n=1), cerebrovascular accident (n=1), and large intestinal ulcer perforation (n=1). ERLEADA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8% of patients, most commonly from rash (2.3%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or reduction of ERLEADA occurred in 23% of patients; the most frequent (>1%) were rash, fatigue, and hypertension. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of ERLEADA-treated patients and 20% in patients receiving placebo. Table 1 shows adverse reactions occurring in \u226510% on the ERLEADA arm in TITAN that occurred with a \u22652% absolute increase in frequency compared to placebo. Table 2 shows laboratory abnormalities that occurred in \u226515% of patients, and more frequently (>5%) in the ERLEADA arm compared to placebo.

In this study, patients received either ERLEADA at a dose of 240 mg daily or a placebo. All patients in the SPARTAN study received a concomitant gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or had a bilateral orchiectomy. The median duration of exposure was 33 months (range: 0.1 to 75 months) in patients who received ERLEADA and 11 months (range: 0.1 to 37 months) in patients who received placebo. Twenty-four patients (3%) who were treated with ERLEADA died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death with \u2265 2 patients included infection (n=7), myocardial infarction (n=3), cerebrovascular event (n=2), and unknown reason (n=3). ERLEADA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of patients, most commonly from rash (3.2%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or reduction of ERLEADA occurred in 33% of patients; the most common (>1%) were rash, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, and hematuria. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of ERLEADA-treated patients and 23% in patients receiving placebo. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (>2%) were fracture (3.4%) in the ERLEADA arm and urinary retention (3.8%) in the placebo arm. Table 3 shows adverse reactions occurring in \u226510% on the ERLEADA arm in SPARTAN that occurred with a \u22652% absolute increase in frequency compared to placebo. Table 4 shows laboratory abnormalities that occurred in \u226515% of patients, and more frequently (>5%) in the ERLEADA arm compared to placebo.

Adverse reactions of rash were reported for 26% of patients treated with ERLEADA versus 8% of patients treated with placebo. Grade 3 rashes (defined as covering > 30% body surface area [BSA]) were reported with ERLEADA treatment (6%) versus placebo (0.5%). The onset of rash occurred at a median of 83 days of ERLEADA treatment. Rash resolved in 78% of patients within a median of 78 days from onset of rash. Rash was commonly managed with oral antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, and 19% of patients received systemic corticosteroids. Dose reduction or dose interruption occurred in 14% and 28% of patients, respectively. Of the patients who had dose interruption, 59% experienced recurrence of rash upon reintroduction of ERLEADA. Hypothyroidism In the combined data of two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies, SPARTAN and TITAN, hypothyroidism was reported for 8% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 1.5% of patients treated with placebo based on assessments of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) every 4 months. Elevated TSH occurred in 25% of patients treated with ERLEADA and 7% of patients treated with placebo. The median onset was at the first scheduled assessment. There were no Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions. Thyroid replacement therapy was initiated in 4.9% of patients treated with ERLEADA. Thyroid replacement therapy, when clinically indicated, should be initiated or dose-adjusted [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ERLEADA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).",
