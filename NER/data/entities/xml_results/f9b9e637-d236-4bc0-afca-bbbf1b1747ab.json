    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious cases of dysphagia, bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have been associated with sevelamer use, some requiring hospitalization and surgery. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Events Patients with dysphagia, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal ( GI ) motility disorders, including severe constipation, or major GI tract surgery were not included in the sevelamer hydrochloride clinical studies. Dysphagia and esophageal tablet retention have been reported in association with use of sevelamer tablets, some requiring hospitalization and intervention. Consider using sevelamer suspension in patients with a history of swallowing disorders. Cases of bowel obstruction, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, and perforation have also been reported with sevelamer use [see Adverse Reactions ( . Inflammatory disorders may resolve upon sevelamer hydrochloride discontinuation. Treatment with sevelamer hydrochloride should be re-evaluated in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal symptoms. 6.2 ) ] 5.2 Monitor Serum Chemistries Bicarbonate and chloride levels should be monitored. 5.3 Monitor for Reduced Vitamins D, E, K ( clotting factors ) and Folic Acid Levels In preclinical studies in rats and dogs, sevelamer hydrochloride reduced vitamins D, E, and K ( coagulation parameters ) and folic acid levels at doses of 6 to 10 times the recommended human dose. In short-term clinical trials, there was no evidence of reduction in serum levels of vitamins. However, in a one-year clinical trial, 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( normal range 10 to 55 ng/mL ) fell from 39 \u00b1 22 ng/mL to 34 \u00b1 22 ng/mL ( p<0.01 ) with sevelamer hydrochloride treatment. Most ( approximately 75% ) patients in sevelamer hydrochloride clinical trials received vitamin supplements, which is typical of patients on dialysis.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common reasons for discontinuing treatment were gastrointestinal adverse reactions. ( 6.1 ) In a parallel design study of 12 weeks duration, treatment-emergent adverse reactions to Sevelamer hydrochloride tablets in peritoneal dialysis patients included dyspepsia ( 12% ) , peritonitis ( 8% ) , diarrhea ( 5% ) , nausea ( 5% ) , constipation ( 4% ) , pruritus ( 4% ) , abdominal distension ( 3% ) , vomiting ( 3% ) , fatigue ( 3% ) , anorexia ( 3% ) , and arthralgia ( 3% ) . ( 6.1 ) Cases of fecal impaction and, less commonly, ileus, bowel obstruction, and bowel perforation have been reported. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals ( USA ) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In a parallel design study of sevelamer hydrochloride with treatment duration of 52 weeks, adverse reactions reported for sevelamer hydrochloride ( n=99 ) were similar to those reported for the active-control group ( n=101 ) . Overall adverse reactions among those treated with sevelamer hydrochloride occurring in >5% of patients included: vomiting ( 22% ) , nausea ( 20% ) , diarrhea ( 19% ) , dyspepsia ( 16% ) , abdominal pain ( 9% ) , flatulence ( 8% ) , and constipation ( 8% ) . A total of 27 patients treated with sevelamer and 10 patients treated with comparator withdrew from the study due to adverse reactions. Based on studies of 8 to 52 weeks, the most common reason for withdrawal from sevelamer hydrochloride was gastrointestinal adverse reactions ( 3%-16% ) . In 143 peritoneal dialysis patients studied for 12 weeks, most adverse reactions were similar to adverse reactions observed in hemodialysis patients. The most frequently occurring treatment- emergent serious adverse reaction was peritonitis ( 8 reactions in 8 patients [8%] in the sevelamer group and 2 reactions in 2 patients [4%] on active control ) . Thirteen patients ( 14% ) in the sevelamer group and 9 patients ( 20% ) in the active-control group discontinued, mostly for gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Patients on peritoneal dialysis should be closely monitored to ensure the reliable use of appropriate aseptic technique with the prompt recognition and management of any signs and symptoms associated with peritonitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sevelamer hydrochloride tablets: hypersensitivity, pruritus, rash, abdominal pain, bleeding gastrointestinal ulcers, colitis, ulceration, necrosis, fecal impaction and uncommon cases of ileus, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal perforation. Appropriate medical management should be given to patients who develop constipation or have worsening of existing constipation to avoid severe complications. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.",
