Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available and monitor patients. ( 5.1 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, urticaria and deaths due to anaphylaxis have been reported following intravenous administration of Indocyanine Green [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Indocyanine Green is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to indocyanine green [see Contraindications ( . Always have cardiopulmonary resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions. 4 )] 5.2 Interference with Thyroid Radioactive Iodine Uptake Studies Because Indocyanine Green contains sodium iodide, the iodine-binding capacity of thyroid tissue may be reduced for at least one week following administration [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )].",

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders : Anaphylaxis, urticaria The most common adverse reactions reported are anaphylaxis and urticaria.
