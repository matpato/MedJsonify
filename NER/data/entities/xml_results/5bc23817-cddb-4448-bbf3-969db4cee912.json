    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of Angina, Heart Failure, or Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension : Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Injection can precipitate angina in patients with severe arteriosclerosis or history of angina, exacerbate underlying heart failure, and increase pulmonary arterial pressure. ( 5.1 ) Peripheral and Visceral Ischemia : Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Injection can cause excessive peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction and ischemia to vital organs. ( 5.2 ) Skin and Subcutaneous Necrosis : Extravasation during intravenous administration may cause necrosis or sloughing of tissue. ( 5.3 ) Bradycardia: Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Injection can cause severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Exacerbation of Angina, Heart Failure, or Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Because of its increasing blood pressure effects, phenylephrine hydrochloride injection can precipitate angina in patients with severe arteriosclerosis or history of angina, exacerbate underlying heart failure, and increase pulmonary arterial pressure. 5.2 Peripheral and Visceral Ischemia Phenylephrine hydrochloride injection can cause excessive peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction and ischemia to vital organs, particularly in patients with extensive peripheral vascular disease. 5.3 Skin and Subcutaneous Necrosis Extravasation of phenylephrine hydrochloride injection can cause necrosis or sloughing of tissue. Avoid extravasation by checking infusion site for free flow. 5.4 Bradycardia Phenylephrine hydrochloride injection can cause severe bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. 5.5 Renal Toxicity Phenylephrine hydrochloride injection can increase the need for renal replacement therapy in patients with septic shock. Monitor renal function. 5.6 Risk of Augmented Pressor Affect in Patients with Autonomic Dysfunction The increasing blood pressure response to adrenergic drugs, including phenylephrine hydrochloride injection, can be increased in patients with autonomic dysfunction, as may occur with spinal cord injuries. 5.7 Pressor Effect with Concomitant Oxytocic Drugs Oxytocic drugs potentiate the increasing blood pressure effect of sympathomimetic pressor amines including phenylephrine hydrochloride injection [see Drug Interactions ( , with the potential for hemorrhagic stroke. 7.1 ) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to phenylephrine hydrochloride injection are primarily attributable to excessive pharmacologic activity. Adverse reactions reported in published clinical studies, observational trials, and case reports of phenylephrine hydrochloride injection are listed below by body system. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders : Reflex bradycardia, lowered cardiac output, ischemia, hypertension, arrhythmias Gastrointestinal disorders : Epigastric pain, vomiting, nausea Nervous system disorders : Headache, blurred vision, neck pain, tremors Vascular disorders : Hypertensive crisis Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Pruritis Most common adverse reactions during treatment: nausea, vomiting, and headache.
