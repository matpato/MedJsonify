Limitations of Use BYLVAY may not be effective in a subgroup of PFIC type 2 patients with specific ABCB11 variants resulting in non-functional or complete absence of the bile salt export pump protein [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) and Clinical Studies (14) ]. 1.2\tAlagille Syndrome (ALGS) BYLVAY is indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients 12 months of age and older with ALGS.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS IBAT inhibitors, including BYLVAY, are contraindicated in patients with prior or active hepatic decompensation events (e.g., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Patients with prior or active hepatic decompensation events (e.g., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy). ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatoxicity : Obtain baseline liver tests and monitor patients frequently for the first 6 to 8 months after starting therapy, and as clinically indicated thereafter during treatment. If liver test abnormalities or signs of clinical hepatitis occur, consider dose reduction or treatment interruption. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities relative to baseline, discontinue BYLVAY. Monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis or portal hypertension more frequently. Permanently discontinue BYLVAY if hepatic decompensation occurs. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Diarrhea : Treat dehydration. Treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required for persistent diarrhea. ( 5.2 ) Fat-Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency : Obtain baseline levels and monitor during treatment. Supplement with FSV if deficiency is observed. If FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite FSV supplementation, consider permanent discontinuation of treatment. Interrupt treatment with BYLVAY if bleeding occurs. Optimize treatment of FSV deficiency and consider restarting BYLVAY once the patient is clinically stable. ( 5.3 ) 5.1\tHepatoxicity BYLVAY treatment is associated with a potential for drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In the PFIC and ALGS trials, treatment-emergent elevations of liver tests or worsening of liver tests occurred. Of the six patients who experienced DILI, two underwent liver transplant. Obtain baseline liver tests because some ALGS and PFIC patients have abnormal liver tests at baseline. Monitor patients frequently for the first 6 to 8 months after starting therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter during treatment with BYLVAY. Monitor for elevation in liver tests, for the development of liver-related adverse reactions, and for physical signs of hepatic decompensation. If liver test abnormalities or signs of clinical hepatitis occur in the absence of other causes, consider dose reduction or treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue BYLVAY if a patient experiences the following: persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, or upon rechallenge, signs and symptoms consistent with clinical hepatitis, or a hepatic decompensation event. The safety and effectiveness of BYLVAY have not been established in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis or portal hypertension more frequently and discontinue BYLVAY if hepatic decompensation occurs. IBAT inhibitors, including BYLVAY, are contraindicated in patients with prior or active hepatic decompensation events [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.2\tDiarrhea In Trial 1, diarrhea in PFIC patients was reported in 2 (10%) placebo-treated patients, 9 (39%) BYLVAY-treated 40 mcg/kg/day patients and 4 (21%) BYLVAY-treated 120 mcg/kg/day patients. Treatment interruption due to diarrhea occurred in 2 patients with 3 events during treatment with BYLVAY 120 mcg/kg/day. Treatment interruption due to diarrhea ranged between 3 to 7 days [see . One patient treated with BYLVAY 120 mcg/kg/day withdrew from Trial 1 due to persistent diarrhea. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] In Trial 3, diarrhea in ALGS patients was reported in 1 placebo-treated patient (6%) and in 10 (29%) BYLVAY-treated patients [see . No patients interrupted or permanently discontinued BYLVAY due to diarrhea. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] If diarrhea occurs, monitor for dehydration and treat promptly. Interrupt BYLVAY dosing if a patient experiences persistent diarrhea. Restart BYLVAY at 40 mcg/kg/day when diarrhea resolves, and increase the dose as tolerated if appropriate. If diarrhea persists and no alternate etiology is identified, stop BYLVAY treatment. 5.3\tFat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiency BYLVAY may adversely affect absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (FSV). FSV include vitamin A, D, E, and K (measured using INR levels). PFIC and ALGS patients can have FSV deficiency at baseline and are frequently supplemented with FSV. In Trial 1 in PFIC patients, new onset or worsening of existing FSV deficiency was reported in 1 (5%) placebo-treated patient, and 3 (16%) BYLVAY-treated 120 mcg/kg/day patients; none of the patients treated with BYLVAY dosage 40 mcg/kg/day had new onset or worsening of existing FSV deficiency. In Trial 3 in ALGS patients, new or worsening of existing FSV deficiency was reported in 3 (17.6%) placebo-treated patients and 3 (8.6%) BYLVAY-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Obtain serum FSV levels at baseline and monitor during treatment, along with any clinical manifestations of FSV deficiency. If FSV deficiency is diagnosed, supplement with FSV. If FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite adequate FSV supplementation, consider permanent discontinuation of BYLVAY depending on the benefit and risk balance. If complications of FSV deficiency occur, consider interrupting BYLVAY treatment and reassess to ensure adequate supplementation with FSV. Consider restarting BYLVAY once the patient is clinically stable. Bleeding Interrupt treatment with BYLVAY if bleeding occurs. Optimize treatment of FSV deficiency and consider restarting BYLVAY once the patient is clinically stable.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hepatotoxicity [ see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.1) Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Fat-Soluble Vitamin Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] PFIC: Most common adverse reactions (>2%) are liver test abnormalities, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. ( 6.1 ) ALGS: Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are diarrhea, abdominal pain, hematoma, and decreased weight. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Albireo Pharma, Inc. at +1-855-252-4736, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. PFIC Clinical Studies Trial 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week study of two dose levels of BYLVAY (40 mcg/kg and 120 mcg/kg) administered once daily [see . Sixty-two patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of the following: Clinical Studies (14.1) ] BYLVAY 40 mcg/kg/day (n=23), BYLVAY 120 mcg/kg/day (n=19), or Placebo (n=20). Table 3 summarizes the frequency of adverse reactions reported in \u22652% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with BYLVAY in Trial 1. The most common adverse reactions observed in Trial 1 included diarrhea, liver test abnormalities, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency. Table 3. Common Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of BYLVAY-treated patients from a Clinical Study of BYLVAY in Patients with Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (Trial 1) Adverse Reaction Placebo N=20 n (%) BYLVAY 40 mcg/kg/day N=23 n (%) BYLVAY 120 mcg/kg/day N=19 n (%) Diarrhea 2 (10%) 9 (39%) 4 (21%) Transaminases increased (ALT, AST) 1 (5%) 3 (13%) 4 (21%) Vomiting 0 4 (17%) 3 (16%) Abdominal pain 0 3 (13%) 3 (16%) Blood bilirubin increased 2 (10%) 3 (13%) 2 (11%) Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E) 1 (5%) 0 3 (16%) Splenomegaly 0 0 2 (11%) Cholelithiasis 0 0 1 (5%) Dehydration 0 0 1 (5%) Fracture 0 1 (4%) 0 Trial 2 is a 72-week, open-label, single-arm trial in PFIC type 1, 2, and 3 patients. Age of the enrolled patients ranged from 4 months to 26 years. BYLVAY 120 mcg/kg/day was administered once daily. A total of 116 PFIC patients were enrolled, of which 56 patients were rolled over from Trial 1. In addition to patients rolled over from Trial 1, an additional 60 patients were enrolled to Trial 2. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions were similar as observed in Trial 1. Adverse reactions observed in Trial 2 but not described in Trial 1 (Table 3) included increased INR (16%), epistaxis (9%), coagulopathy (3%), iron deficiency anemia (3%), prolonged prothrombin time (2%) and variceal hemorrhage, stoma hemorrhage, hematochezia, and rectal hemorrhage (<1% each). The most common reason for BYLVAY treatment interruption was liver test abnormalities (increases in ALT, AST, direct and total bilirubin). Of the 33 patients who discontinued BYLVAY in Trial 2, five underwent or were referred for liver transplantation and one patient underwent surgical biliary diversion (SBD). There were a total of 19 patients who underwent surgical intervention in Trial 2, with one patient who had SBD followed by liver transplant, 15 patients who underwent liver transplant alone, and three patients who underwent SBD alone. ALGS Clinical Studies Trial 3 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week study of a single dose level of BYLVAY (120 mcg/kg) administered once daily [see . Fifty-two patients were randomized (2:1) to receive one of the following: Clinical Studies (14.2) ] BYLVAY 120 mcg/kg/day (n=35), or Placebo (n=17). Table 4 summarizes the frequency of adverse reactions in patients with ALGS, reported in \u22655% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with BYLVAY in Trial 3. No patients discontinued study treatment due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions observed in Trial 3 included diarrhea, abdominal pain, hematoma, and decreased weight. Table 4. Common Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions that occurred in \u22655% of BYLVAY-treated patients from a Clinical Study of BYLVAY in Patients with Alagille Syndrome (Trial 3) Adverse Reaction Placebo N=17 n (%) BYLVAY 120 mcg/kg/day N=35 n (%) Diarrhea 1 (6%) 10 (29%) Abdominal Pain 1 (6%) 5 (14%) Hematoma 0 3 (9%) Weight decreased 0 2 (6%) Trial 4 is a 72-week, open-label extension study in 49 pediatric patients with ALGS aged 1 to 15 years. BYLVAY 120 mcg/kg/day was administered once daily. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions were similar to those observed in Trial 3. The most common reason for BYLVAY treatment interruption was gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhea and abdominal pain. Hepatotoxicity BYLVAY treatment is associated with a potential for DILI. In the PFIC and ALGS trials, treatment-emergent elevations of liver tests or worsening of liver tests occurred. Of the six patients who experienced DILI, two underwent liver transplant. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BYLVAY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders : gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gingival hemorrhage, liver transplant Investigations : gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, hemoglobin decreased Nervous system disorders: extra-axial hemorrhage (subdural hemorrhage) Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis",
