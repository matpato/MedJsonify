These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. Do not touch the tip of the dispensing container to the eye or surrounding structures. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] .",

( ) 6.1 To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie at 1-800-678-1605 or the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions\u00a0occurring in approximately 10% to\u00a020% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1% to 0.2%) included: allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival hyperemia, and eye pruritus. Adverse\u00a0reactions\u00a0occurring in approximately 5% to 9% included: burning sensation, conjunctival folliculosis, hypertension, ocular allergic reaction, oral dryness, and visual disturbance. Adverse reactions\u00a0occurring in approximately 1% to 4% of the subjects receiving brimonidine ophthalmic solution (0.1% to\u00a00.2%) included: abnormal taste, allergic reaction, asthenia, blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchitis, cataract, conjunctival edema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, cough, dizziness, dyspepsia, dyspnea, epiphora, eye discharge, eye dryness, eye irritation, eye pain, eyelid edema, eyelid erythema, fatigue, flu syndrome, follicular conjunctivitis, foreign body sensation, gastrointestinal disorder, headache, hypercholesterolemia, hypotension, infection (primarily colds and respiratory infections), insomnia, keratitis, lid disorder, pharyngitis, photophobia, rash, rhinitis, sinus infection, sinusitis, somnolence, stinging, superficial punctate keratopathy, tearing, visual field defect, vitreous detachment, vitreous disorder, vitreous floaters, and worsened visual acuity. The following reactions\u00a0were reported in less than 1% of subjects: corneal erosion, hordeolum, nasal dryness, and taste perversion. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postapproval use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Bradycardia, depression, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), syncope, and tachycardia. Apnea, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions.",
