    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ONYDA XR is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to clonidine. Reactions have included generalized rash, urticaria, and angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. History of a hypersensitivity reaction to clonidine. Reactions have included generalized rash, urticaria, angioedema. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension/bradycardia: Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, syncope, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. ( 5.1 ) Somnolence/Sedation: Has been observed with clonidine. Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution\u00a0patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to ONYDA XR ( 5.2 ) Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hypotension/Bradycardia Treatment with ONYDA XR can cause dose-related decreases in blood pressure and heart rate [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate ONYDA XR slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . 5.2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies with clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients that completed 5 weeks of therapy in a controlled, fixed dose pediatric monotherapy study, 31% of patients treated with 0.4 mg/day and 38% treated with 0.2 mg/day versus 4% of placebo treated patients reported somnolence as an adverse reaction. In patients that completed 5 weeks of therapy in a controlled flexible dose pediatric adjunctive to stimulants study, 19% of patients treated with clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets plus a stimulant versus 7% treated with placebo plus a stimulant reported somnolence. Before using ONYDA XR with other centrally active depressants (such as phenothiazines, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines), consider the potential for additive sedative effects [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with ONYDA XR. Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. 5.3 Rebound Hypertension Abrupt discontinuation of ONYDA XR can cause rebound hypertension. In adults with hypertension, sudden cessation of clonidine extended-release formulation treatment in the 0.2 to 0.6 mg per day range resulted in reports of headache, tachycardia, nausea, flushing, warm feeling, brief lightheadedness, tightness in chest, and anxiety. In adults with hypertension, sudden cessation of treatment with immediate-release clonidine has, in some cases, resulted in symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, headache, and tremor accompanied or followed by a rapid rise in blood pressure and elevated catecholamine concentrations in the plasma. No studies evaluating abrupt discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pediatric patients with ADHD have been conducted; however, to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension, gradually reduce the dose of ONYDA XR in decrements of no more than 0.1 mg every 3 to 7 days. Patients should be instructed not to discontinue ONYDA XR therapy without consulting their physician due to the potential risk of withdrawal effects. 5.4 Allergic Reactions In patients who have developed localized contact sensitization to clonidine transdermal system, continuation of clonidine transdermal system or use of oral ONYDA XR therapy may be associated with the development of a generalized skin rash. In patients who develop an allergic reaction from clonidine transdermal system, use of ONYDA XR may also elicit an allergic reaction (including generalized rash, urticaria, or angioedema). 5.5 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of clonidine may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. There have been post-marketing reports of patients with conduction abnormalities and/or taking other sympatholytic drugs who developed severe bradycardia requiring intravenous (IV) atropine, IV isoproterenol, and temporary cardiac pacing while taking clonidine. Titrate ONYDA XR slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described in greater detail elsewhere in labeling: Hypotension/bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Rebound hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Allergic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 5% and twice the rate of placebo) as monotherapy in ADHD: somnolence, fatigue, irritability, nightmare, insomnia, constipation, dry mouth. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 5% and twice the rate of placebo) as adjunct therapy to psychostimulant in ADHD: somnolence, fatigue, decreased appetite, dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Tris Pharma, Inc. at (732) 940-0358 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of ONYDA XR for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients 6 years and older is based upon adequate and well-controlled studies of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (referred to as \u201cclonidine hydrochloride extended-release\u201d in this section). The safety results of these adequate and well-controlled studies of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets are presented below. Two clonidine hydrochloride extended-release ADHD clinical studies (Study 1 and Study 2) evaluated 256 patients in two 8-week placebo-controlled studies. A third clonidine hydrochloride extended-release ADHD clinical study (Study 3) evaluated 135\u00a0pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age in a 40-week placebo-controlled randomized\u2011withdrawal study. Study 1: Fixed-dose clonidine hydrochloride extended-release Monotherapy Study 1 was a short-term, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two fixed doses (0.2 mg/day or 0.4 mg/day) of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD hyperactive or combined inattentive/hyperactive subtypes. Most Common Adverse Reactions (incidence of \u2265 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo): somnolence, fatigue, irritability, insomnia, nightmare, constipation, dry mouth. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release: Five patients (7%) in the low dose group (0.2 mg), 15 patients (20%) in the high dose group (0.4 mg), and 1 patient in the placebo group (1%) reported adverse reactions that led to discontinuation. The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were somnolence and fatigue. Commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence of \u22652% in either active treatment group and greater than the rate on placebo) during the treatment period are listed in Table 1 .

Most clonidine hydrochloride extended-release treated patients (75.5%) were escalated to the maximum dose of 0.4 mg/day. Most Common Adverse Reactions (incidence of \u2265 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo): somnolence, fatigue, decreased appetite, dizziness. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation: There was one patient in the clonidine hydrochloride extended-release + stimulant (group (1%) who discontinued because of an adverse event (severe bradyphrenia, with severe fatigue). Commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence of \u22652% in the treatment group and greater than the rate on placebo) during the treatment period are listed in Table 3 .

The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release monotherapy treated patients were somnolence/sedation (5%) and fatigue (4%). Effect on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate In patients that completed 5 weeks of treatment in a controlled, fixed-dose monotherapy study in pediatric patients, during the treatment period the maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in systolic blood pressure was -4.0 mmHg on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.2 mg/day and -8.8 mmHg on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.4 mg/day. The maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in diastolic blood pressure was -4.0 mmHg on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.2 mg/day and -7.3 mmHg on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.4 mg/day. The maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in heart rate was \u20114.0 beats per minute on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.2 mg/day and -7.7 beats per minute on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.4 mg/day. During the taper period of the fixed-dose monotherapy study the maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in systolic blood pressure was +3.4 mmHg on clonidine hydrochloride extended\u2011release 0.2 mg/day and -5.6 mmHg on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.4\u00a0mg/day. The maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in diastolic blood pressure was +3.3\u00a0mmHg on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.2 mg/day and -5.4 mmHg on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.4 mg/day. The maximum placebo-subtracted mean change in heart rate was -0.6 beats per minute on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.2\u00a0mg/day and -3.0 beats per minute on clonidine hydrochloride extended-release 0.4 mg/day. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clonidine hydrochloride extended-release tablets (and excludes those already mentioned in Section 6.1 ). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. hallucinations Psychiatric: Q-T prolongation Cardiovascular:",
