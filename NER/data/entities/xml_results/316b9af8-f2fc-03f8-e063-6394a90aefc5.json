    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Promethazine Hydrochloride Syrup (Promethazine Hydrochloride Oral Solution, USP) is contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than two years of age. Promethazine HCl Oral Solution is contraindicated in comatose states, and in individuals known to be hypersensitive or to have had an idiosyncratic reaction to promethazine or to other phenothiazines. Antihistamines are contraindicated for use in the treatment of lower respiratory tract symptoms, including asthma.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Promethazine Hydrochloride Oral Solution should not be used in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age because of the potential for fatal respiratory depression. Postmarketing cases of respiratory depression, including fatalities, have been reported with use of promethazine in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. A wide range of weight-based doses of promethazine have resulted in respiratory depression in these patients. Caution should be exercised when administering promethazine to pediatric patients 2 years of age and older. It is recommended that the lowest effective dose of promethazine be used in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older and concomitant administration of other drugs with respiratory depressant effects be avoided. CNS Depression Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The impairment may be amplified by concomitant use of other central-nervous-system depressants such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should either be eliminated or given in reduced dosage in the presence of promethazine HCl (see and PRECAUTIONS \u2013 Information for Patients ). Drug Interactions Respiratory Depression Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression. Use of Promethazine HCl Oral Solution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., COPD, sleep apnea) should be avoided. Lower Seizure Threshold Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may lower seizure threshold. It should be used with caution in persons with seizure disorders or in persons who are using concomitant medications, such as narcotics or local anesthetics, which may also affect seizure threshold. Bone-Marrow Depression Promethazine HCl Oral Solution should be used with caution in patients with bone-marrow depression. Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported, usually when Promethazine HCl Oral Solution has been used in association with other known marrow-toxic agents. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with promethazine HCl alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of promethazine HCl, antipsychotic drugs, if any, and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. Since recurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines, the reintroduction of promethazine HCl should be carefully considered. Use in Pediatric Patients Promethazine HCl Oral Solution is contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than two years of age. Caution should be exercised when administering Promethazine HCl Oral Solution to pediatric patients 2 years of age and older because of the potential for fatal respiratory depression. Respiratory depression and apnea, sometimes associated with death, are strongly associated with promethazine products and are not directly related to individualized weight-based dosing, which might otherwise permit safe administration. Concomitant administration of promethazine products with other respiratory depressants has an association with respiratory depression, and sometimes death, in pediatric patients. Antiemetics are not recommended for treatment of uncomplicated vomiting in pediatric patients, and their use should be limited to prolonged vomiting of known etiology. The extrapyramidal symptoms which can occur secondary to Promethazine HCl Oral Solution administration may be confused with the CNS signs of undiagnosed primary disease, e.g., encephalopathy or Reye\u2019s syndrome. The use of Promethazine HCl Oral Solution should be avoided in pediatric patients whose signs and symptoms may suggest Reye\u2019s syndrome or other hepatic diseases. Excessively large dosages of antihistamines, including Promethazine HCl Oral Solution, in pediatric patients may cause sudden death (see ). Hallucinations and convulsions have occurred with therapeutic doses and overdoses of Promethazine HCl Oral Solution in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients who are acutely ill associated with dehydration, there is an increased susceptibility to dystonias with the use of promethazine HCl. OVERDOSAGE Other Considerations Administration of promethazine HCl has been associated with reported cholestatic jaundice.PRECAUTIONS General Drugs having anticholinergic properties should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, and bladder-neck obstruction. Promethazine HCl Oral Solution should be used cautiously in persons with cardiovascular disease or with impairment of liver function. Information for Patients Patients should be advised to measure Promethazine HCl Oral Solution with an accurate measuring device. A household teaspoon is not an accurate measuring device and could lead to overdosage, especially when a half a teaspoon is measured. A pharmacist can recommend an appropriate measuring device and can provide instructions for measuring the correct dose. Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may cause marked drowsiness or impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Ambulatory patients should be told to avoid engaging in such activities until it is known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from promethazine therapy. Pediatric patients should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities. The concomitant use of alcohol or other central-nervous-system depressants, such as sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers may enhance impairment (see and WARNINGS-CNS Depression ). PRECAUTIONS\u2013Drug Interactions Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun. Drug Interactions CNS Depressants \u2013 Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of other central-nervous-system depressants such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with Promethazine HCl Oral Solution, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine HCl relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain. Epinephrine \u2013 Because of the potential for Promethazine HCl Oral Solution to reverse epinephrine\u2019s vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with Promethazine HCl Oral Solution overdose. Anticholinergics\u2013 Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) \u2013 Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAOI and phenothiazines are used concomitantly. This possibility should be considered with Promethazine HCl Oral Solution. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving therapy with promethazine HCl: Pregnancy Tests Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations. Glucose Tolerance Test An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving promethazine HCl. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of promethazine, nor are there other animal or human data concerning carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility with this drug. Promethazine was nonmutagenic in the Salmonella test system of Ames. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects-Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat-feeding studies at doses of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg of promethazine HCl. These doses are from approximately 2.1 to 4.2 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine for a 50-kg subject, depending upon the indication for which the drug is prescribed. Daily doses of 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally have been found to produce fetal mortality in rats. Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition, lactation, and development of the animal neonate were not done, but a general preliminary study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters. Although antihistamines have been found to produce fetal mortality in rodents, the pharmacological effects of histamine in the rodent do not parallel those in man. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Promethazine HCl Oral Solution in pregnant women. Promethazine HCl Oral Solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Promethazine HCl Oral Solution administered to a pregnant woman within two weeks of delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn. Labor and Delivery Promethazine HCl Oral Solution may be used alone or as an adjunct to narcotic analgesics during labor (see ). Limited data suggest that use of Promethazine HCl Oral Solution during labor and delivery does not have an appreciable effect on the duration of labor or delivery and does not increase the risk of need for intervention in the newborn. The effect on later growth and development of the newborn is unknown (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Nonteratogenic Effects Nursing Mothers It is not known whether promethazine HCl is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Promethazine HCl Oral Solution, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Promethazine HCl Oral Solution is contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than two years of age (see and WARNINGS \u2013 Boxed Warning Use in Pediatric Patients ). Promethazine HCl Oral Solution should be used with caution in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older (see WARNINGS-Use in Pediatric Patients ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of promethazine formulations did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of Promethazine HCl Oral Solution and observed closely.",
