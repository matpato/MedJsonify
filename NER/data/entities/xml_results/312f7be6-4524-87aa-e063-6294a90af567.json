    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypoglycemia: May be severe. Ensure proper patient selection, dosing, and instructions, particularly in at-risk populations ( e.g. , elderly, renally impaired ) and when used with other anti-diabetic medications ( 5.1 ) . Hypersensitivity Reactions: Postmarketing reports include anaphylaxis, angioedema and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. If a reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue glimepiride, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. ( 5.2 ) . Hemolytic Anemia: Can occur if glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6 PD ) deficient. Consider a non-sulfonylurea alternative. ( 5.3 ) . Potential Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas: Inform patient of risks, benefits and treatment alternatives. ( 5.4 ) . Macrovascular Outcomes: No clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glimepiride or any other anti-diabetic drug ( 5.5 ) . 5.1 Hypoglycemia All sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, can cause severe hypoglycemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia. These impairments may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important, such as driving or operating other machinery. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death. Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Use caution when initiating and increasing glimepiride doses in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia ( e.g. , the elderly, patients with renal impairment, patients on other anti- diabetic medications ) . Debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal, pituitary, or hepatic impairment are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering medications. Hypoglycemia is also more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, or when alcohol is ingested. Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced in patients with autonomic neuropathy, the elderly, and in patients who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking medications or other sympatholytic agents. These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia before the patient is aware of the hypoglycemia. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with glimepiride, including serious reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens- Johnson Syndrome [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, promptly discontinue glimepiride, assess for other potential causes for the reaction, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. 5.3 Hemolytic Anemia Sulfonylureas can cause hemolytic anemia in patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6 PD ) deficiency. Because glimepiride is a sulfonylurea, use caution in patients with G6 PD deficiency and consider the use of a non-sulfonylurea alternative. There are also postmarketing reports of hemolytic anemia in patients receiving glimepiride who did not have known G6 PD deficiency [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . 5.4 Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality with Sulfonylureas The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program ( UGDP ) , a long-term, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide ( 1.5 grams per day ) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2 and a half times that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glimepiride and of alternative modes of therapy. Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class ( tolbutamide ) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure. 5.5 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with glimepiride or any other anti-diabetic drug.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in the labeling: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Hemolytic anemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Common adverse reactions in clinical trials ( \u22655% and more common than with placebo ) include hypoglycemia, headache, nausea, and dizziness ( 6.1 ) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or . www.accordhealthcare.us or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Approximately 2.800 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with glimepiride in the controlled clinical trials. In these trials, approximately 1.700 patients were treated with glimepiride for at least 1 year.In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with glimepiride were hypoglycemia, dizziness, asthenia, headache, and nausea. Table 1 summarizes adverse events, other than hypoglycemia, that were reported in 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials, whether or not considered to be possibly or probably related to study medication. Treatment duration ranged from 13 weeks to 12 months. Terms that are reported represent those that occurred at an incidence of \u22655% among glimepiride-treated patients and more commonly than in patients who received placebo. mes the upper limit of the reference range. Table 1: Eleven Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials ranging from 13 weeks to 12 months: Adverse Events ( excluding hypoglycemia ) Occurring in \u22655% of glimepiride-treated Patients and at a Greater Incidence than with Placebo* Glimepiride Placebo N=745 N=294 % % Headache 8.2 7.8 Accidental Injury \u2020 5.8 3.4 Flu Syndrome 5.4 4.4 Nausea 5.0 3.4 Dizziness 5.0 2.4 * Glimepiride doses ranged from 1 to 16 mg administered daily \u2020Insufficient information to determine whether any of the accidental injury events were associated with hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 14 weeks duration, patients already on sulfonylurea therapy underwent a 3-week washout period then were randomized to glimepiride 1 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg or placebo. Patients randomized to glimepiride 4 mg or 8 mg underwent forced-titration from an initial dose of 1 mg to these final doses, as tolerated [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia ( defined by the presence of at least one symptom that the investigator believed might be related to hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required ) was 4% for glimepiride 1 mg, 17% for glimepiride 4 mg, 16% for glimepiride 8 mg and 0% for placebo. All of these events were self-treated. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial of 22 weeks duration, patients received a starting dose of either 1 mg glimepiride or placebo daily. The dose of glimepiride was titrated to a target fasting plasma glucose of 90 to 150 mg/dL. Final daily doses of glimepiride were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . The overall incidence of possible hypoglycemia ( as defined above for the 14-week trial ) for glimepiride vs. placebo was 19.7% vs. 3.2% . All of these events were self-treated. Weight gain: glimepiride, like all sulfonylureas, can cause weight gain [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . Allergic Reactions:In clinical trials, allergic reactions, such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in less than 1% of glimepiride- treated patients. These may resolve despite continued treatment with glimepiride. There are postmarketing reports of more serious allergic reactions ( e.g. , dyspnea, hypotension, shock ) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Laboratory Tests Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) : In 11 pooled placebo-controlled trials of glimepiride, 1.9% of glimepiride-treated patients and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients developed serum ALT greater than 2 ti 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of glimepiride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Hemolytic anemia in patients with and without G6 PD deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Impairment of liver function ( e.g. , with cholestasis and jaundice ) , as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure. Porphyria cutanea tarda, photosensitivity reactions and allergic vasculitis Leukopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and pancytopenia Thrombocytopenia ( including severe cases with platelet count less than 10.000/\u03bcL ) and thrombocytopenic purpura Hepatic porphyria reactions and disulfiram-like reactions Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) , most often in patients who are on other medications or who have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone Dysgeusia Alopecia",
