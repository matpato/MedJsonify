    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor indicated for: Adjuvant     treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer.     ( 1.1 ) Extended adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women     with early breast cancer who have received prior standard adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.     ( 1.2 ) First and second-line treatment of postmenopausal     women with hormone receptor positive or unknown advanced breast cancer. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer Letrozole tablets are indicated for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer. 1.2 Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer Letrozole tablets are indicated for the extended adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer in postmenopausal women, who have received 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. The effectiveness of letrozole tablets in extended adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer is based on an analysis of disease-free survival (DFS) in patients treated with letrozole tablets for a median of 60 months [see . Clinical Studies (14.2 , 14.3) ] 1.3 First and Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer Letrozole tablets are indicated for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive or unknown, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Letrozole tablets are also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.4 , 14.5) ].",

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Decreases in bone mineral density may occur. Consider bone mineral density monitoring. ( 5.1 ) Increases in total cholesterol may occur. Consider cholesterol monitoring. ( 5.2 ) Fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence may occur. Exercise caution when operating machinery. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Obtain a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Bone Effects Use of letrozole may cause decreases in bone mineral density (BMD). Consideration should be given to monitoring BMD. Results of a safety study to evaluate safety in the adjuvant setting comparing the effect on lumbar spine (L2-L4) BMD of adjuvant treatment with letrozole to that with tamoxifen showed at 24 months a median decrease in lumbar spine BMD of 4.1% in the letrozole arm compared to a median increase of 0.3% in the tamoxifen arm (difference = 4.4%) ( P < 0.0001) [see . Updated results from the BMD substudy (MA-17B) in the extended adjuvant setting demonstrated that at 2 years patients receiving letrozole had a median decrease from baseline of 3.8% in hip BMD compared to a median decrease of 2.0% in the placebo group. The changes from baseline in lumbar spine BMD in letrozole and placebo treated groups were not significantly different Adverse Reactions (6) ] [see In the adjuvant trial (BIG 1-98) the incidence of bone fractures at any time after randomization was 14.7% for letrozole and 11.4% for tamoxifen at a median follow-up of 96 months. The incidence of osteoporosis was 5.1% for letrozole and 2.7% for tamoxifen Adverse Reactions (6) ]. [see . In the extended adjuvant trial (MA-17), the incidence of bone fractures at any time after randomization was 13.3% for letrozole and 7.8% for placebo at a median follow-up of 62 months. The incidence of new osteoporosis was 14.5% for letrozole and 7.8% for placebo Adverse Reactions (6) ] [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.2 Cholesterol Consideration should be given to monitoring serum cholesterol. In the adjuvant trial (BIG 1-98), hypercholesterolemia was reported in 52.3% of letrozole patients and 28.6% of tamoxifen patients. Grade 3 to 4 hypercholesterolemia was reported in 0.4% of letrozole patients and 0.1% of tamoxifen patients. Also in the adjuvant setting, an increase of greater than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) in total cholesterol (generally nonfasting) was observed in patients on monotherapy who had baseline total serum cholesterol within the normal range (i.e., less than =1.5 x ULN) in 155/1843 (8.4%) patients on letrozole vs 71/1840 (3.9%) patients on tamoxifen Lipid lowering medications were required for 29% of patients on letrozole and 20% on tamoxifen [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Impairment Subjects with cirrhosis and severe hepatic impairment who were dosed with 2.5 mg of letrozole experienced approximately twice the exposure to letrozole as healthy volunteers with normal liver function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, a dose reduction is recommended for this patient population. The effect of hepatic impairment on letrozole exposure in cancer patients with elevated bilirubin levels has not been determined [see ]. Dosage and Administration (2.5) 5.4 Fatigue and Dizziness Because fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence have been reported with the use of letrozole, caution is advised when driving or using machinery until it is known how the patient reacts to letrozole use. 5.5 Laboratory Test Abnormalities No dose-related effect of letrozole on any hematologic or clinical chemistry parameter was evident. Moderate decreases in lymphocyte counts, of uncertain clinical significance, were observed in some patients receiving letrozole 2.5 mg. This depression was transient in about half of those affected. Two patients on letrozole developed thrombocytopenia; relationship to the study drug was unclear. Patient withdrawal due to laboratory abnormalities, whether related to study treatment or not was infrequent. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on\u00a0post-marketing reports, findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, letrozole can cause fetal harm and is contraindicated for use in pregnant women. In post-marketing reports, use of letrozole during pregnancy resulted in cases of spontaneous abortions and congenital birth defects. Letrozole caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits at maternal exposures that were below the maximum recommended human dose (MHRD) on a mg/m 2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with letrozole and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) , ( Use in Specific Populations 8.1 , 8.3) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ].",

Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer In study, BIG 1 to 98, the median treatment duration of adjuvant treatment was 60 months and the median duration of follow-up for safety was 96 months for patients receiving letrozole and tamoxifen. Certain adverse reactions were prospectively specified for analysis (see Table 1), based on the known pharmacologic properties and side effect profiles of the two drugs. Adverse reactions were analyzed irrespective of whether a symptom was present or absent at baseline. Most adverse reactions reported (approximately 75% of patients who reported AEs) were Grade 1 or Grade 2 applying the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0/Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0.

TIA = Transient ischemic attack. Note: Cardiovascular events (including cerebrovascular and thromboembolic events), skeletal and urogenital/ endometrial events and second primary malignancies were collected life -long. All of these events were assumed to be of CTC Grade 3 to 5 and were not individually graded. When considering all grades during study treatment, a higher incidence of events was seen for letrozole regarding fractures (10.1% vs 7.1%), myocardial infarctions (1.0% vs 0.5%), and arthralgia (25.2% vs 20.4%) (Letrozole vs tamoxifen respectively). A higher incidence was seen for tamoxifen regarding thromboembolic events (2.1% vs 3.6%), endometrial hyperplasia/cancer (0.3% vs 2.9%), and endometrial proliferation disorders (0.3% vs 1.8%) (Letrozole vs tamoxifen respectively). At a median follow-up of 96 months, a higher incidence of events was seen for letrozole (14.7%) than for tamoxifen (11.4%) regarding fractures. A higher incidence was seen for tamoxifen compared to letrozole regarding thromboembolic events (4.6% vs 3.2%), and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer (2.9% vs 0.4%) (tamoxifen vs letrozole, respectively). Results of a safety trial in 263 postmenopausal women with resected receptor positive early breast cancer in the adjuvant setting comparing the effect on lumbar spine (L2-L4) BMD of adjuvant treatment with letrozole to that with tamoxifen showed at 24 months a median decrease in lumbar spine BMD of 4.1% in the letrozole arm compared to a median increase of 0.3% in the tamoxifen arm (difference = 4.4%) ( Bone Study : P < 0.0001). No patients with a normal BMD at baseline became osteoporotic over the 2 years and only 1 patient with osteopenia at baseline (T score of -1.9) developed osteoporosis during the treatment period (assessment by central review). The results for total hip BMD were similar, although the differences between the two treatments were less pronounced. During the 2 year period, fractures were reported by 4 of 103 patients (4%) in the letrozole arm, and 6 of 97 patients (6%) in the tamoxifen arm. In a safety trial in 263 postmenopausal women with resected receptor positive early breast cancer at 24 months comparing the effects on lipid profiles of adjuvant letrozole to tamoxifen, 12% of patients on letrozole had at least one total cholesterol value of a higher CTCAE grade than at baseline compared with 4% of patients on tamoxifen. In another postapproval randomized, multicenter, open label, study of letrozole vs anastrozole in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor and node positive breast cancer (FACE, NCT00248170), the median duration of treatment was 60 months for both treatment arms. Table 2 describes adverse reactions (Grades 1 to 4 and Grades 3 to 4) irrespective of relationship to study treatment in the adjuvant study (safety population).

Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer, Median Treatment Duration of 24 Months In study MA-17, the median duration of extended adjuvant treatment was 24 months and the median duration of follow-up for safety was 28 months for patients receiving letrozole and placebo. Table 3 describes the adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of at least 5% in any treatment group during treatment. Most adverse reactions reported were Grade 1 and Grade 2 based on the CTC Version 2.0. In the extended adjuvant setting, the reported drug-related adverse reactions that were significantly different from placebo were hot flashes, arthralgia/arthritis, and myalgia.

The incidence of self-reported osteoporosis was higher in patients who received letrozole 6.9% (176) than in patients who received placebo 5.5% (141). Bisphosphonates were administered to 21.1% of the patients who received letrozole and 18.7% of the patients who received placebo. The incidence of cardiovascular ischemic events from the core randomized study was comparable between patients who received letrozole 6.8% (175) and placebo 6.5% (167). A patient-reported measure that captures treatment impact on important symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency demonstrated a difference in favor of placebo for vasomotor and sexual symptom domains. Bone Substudy: [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] In the extended adjuvant setting, based on a median duration of follow-up of 62 months, there was no significant difference between letrozole and placebo in total cholesterol or in any lipid fraction at any time over 5 years. Use of lipid lowering drugs or dietary management of elevated lipids was allowed Lipid Substudy : [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Updated Analysis, Extended Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer, Median Treatment Duration of 60 Months The extended adjuvant treatment trial (MA-17) was unblinded early [see . At the updated (final analysis), overall the side effects seen were consistent to those seen at a median treatment duration of 24 months. Adverse Reactions (6) ] During treatment or within 30 days of stopping treatment (median duration of treatment 60 months) a higher rate of fractures was observed for letrozole (10.4%) compared to placebo (5.8%), as also a higher rate of osteoporosis (letrozole 12.2% vs placebo 6.4%). Based on 62 months median duration of follow-up in the randomized letrozole arm in the safety population the incidence of new fractures at any time after randomization was 13.3% for letrozole and 7.8% for placebo. The incidence of new osteoporosis was 14.5% for letrozole and 7.8% for placebo. During treatment or within 30 days of stopping treatment (median duration of treatment 60 months), the incidence of cardiovascular events was 9.8% for letrozole and 7.0% for placebo. Based on 62 months median duration of follow-up in the randomized letrozole arm in the safety population the incidence of cardiovascular disease at any time after randomization was 14.4% for letrozole and 9.8% for placebo. : In the extended adjuvant setting (MA-17), based on a median duration of follow-up of 62 months, there was no significant difference between letrozole and placebo in total cholesterol or in any lipid fraction over 5 years. Use of lipid lowering drugs or dietary management of elevated lipids was allowed Lipid Substudy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. First-Line Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer In study P025 a total of 455 patients were treated for a median time of exposure of 11 months in the letrozole arm (median 6 months in the tamoxifen arm). The incidence of adverse reactions was similar for letrozole and tamoxifen. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, arthralgia, and dyspnea. Discontinuations for adverse reactions other than progression of tumor occurred in 10/455 (2%) of patients on letrozole and in 15/455 (3%) of patients on tamoxifen. Adverse reactions that were reported in at least 5% of the patients treated with letrozole 2.5 mg or tamoxifen 20 mg in the first-line treatment study are shown in Table 4.

Peripheral thromboembolic events included venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, portal vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. Cardiovascular events included angina, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and coronary heart disease. Cerebrovascular events included transient ischemic attacks, thrombotic or hemorrhagic strokes, and development of hemiparesis. Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer Study discontinuations in the megestrol acetate comparison study (AR/BC2) for adverse reactions other than progression of tumor were 5/188 (2.7%) on letrozole 0.5 mg, in 4/174 (2.3%) on letrozole 2.5 mg, and in 15/190 (7.9%) on megestrol acetate. There were fewer thromboembolic events at both letrozole doses than on the megestrol acetate arm (0.6% vs 4.7%). There was also less vaginal bleeding (0.3% vs 3.2%) on letrozole than on megestrol acetate. In the aminoglutethimide comparison study (AR/BC3), discontinuations for reasons other than progression occurred in 6/193 (3.1%) on 0.5 mg letrozole, 7/185 (3.8%) on 2.5 mg letrozole, and 7/178 (3.9%) of patients on aminoglutethimide. Comparisons of the incidence of adverse reactions revealed no significant differences between the high and low dose letrozole groups in either study. Most of the adverse reactions observed in all treatment groups were mild to moderate in severity and it was generally not possible to distinguish adverse reactions due to treatment from the consequences of the patient\u2019s metastatic breast cancer, the effects of estrogen deprivation, or intercurrent illness. Adverse reactions that were reported in at least 5% of the patients treated with letrozole 0.5 mg, letrozole 2.5 mg, megestrol acetate, or aminoglutethimide in the two controlled trials AR/BC2 and AR/BC3 are shown in Table 5.

Other less frequent (less than 5%) adverse reactions considered consequential and reported in at least 3 patients treated with letrozole, included hypercalcemia, fracture, depression, anxiety, pleural effusion, alopecia, increased sweating, and vertigo. First and Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Breast Cancer In the combined analysis of the first- and second-line metastatic trials and postmarketing experiences other adverse reactions that were reported were cataract, eye irritation, palpitations, cardiac failure, tachycardia, dysesthesia (including hypesthesia/paresthesia), arterial thrombosis, memory impairment, irritability, nervousness, urticaria, increased urinary frequency, leukopenia, stomatitis cancer pain, pyrexia, vaginal discharge, appetite increase, dryness of skin and mucosa (including dry mouth), and disturbances of taste and thirst. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of letrozole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye Disorders: blurred vision Hepatobiliary Disorders: increased hepatic enzymes, hepatitis Immune System Disorders: anaphylactic reactions, hypersensitivity reactions Nervous System Disorders: carpal tunnel syndrome Pregnancy: spontaneous abortions, congenital birth defects Skin and subcutaneous disorders: angioedema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: tendon disorders including tendon rupture, tendonitis, tenosynovitis, and tenosynovitis stenosans (trigger finger)",
