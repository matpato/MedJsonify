    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypotension: Slow the infusion; as needed, add vasopressor drugs, positive inotropic agents, and volume expansion. (5.2) \u2022 Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) Post Cardiac Transplant ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Bradycardia and AV block: Slow the infusion or discontinue. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (9 to 36 days) and its metabolite desethylamiodarone (9 to 30 days), adverse reactions or interactions, as well as observed adverse effects, can persist following amiodarone withdrawal. 5.2 Hypotension Hypotension, the most common adverse reaction seen with intravenous amiodarone seen most often in the first several hours of treatment and is likely related to the rate of infusion. In some cases, hypotension may be refractory and result in a fatal outcome.  Hypotension necessitating alterations in intravenous amiodarone therapy was reported in 3% of patients, with permanent discontinuation required in less than 2% of patients. Treat hypotension initially by slowing the infusion; additional standard therapy may be needed, including the following: vasopressor drugs, positive inotropic agents, and volume expansion . Monitor the initial rate of infusion closely and do not exceed the recommended rate [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2) 5.3 Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) Post Cardiac Transplant In retrospective studies, amiodarone use in transplant recipients prior to heart transplants has been associated with an increased risk of PGD. PGD is a life-threatening complication of heart transplantation that presents as a left, right or biventricular dysfunction occurring within the first 24 hours of transplant surgery for which there is no identifiable secondary cause (see section 6.2 ). Severe PGD may be irreversible. For patients who are on the heart transplant waiting list, consideration should be given to use an alternative antiarrhythmic drug as early as possible before transplant. 5.4 Bradycardia and Atrioventricular Block NEXTERONE Premixed Injection causes bradycardia and AV block which may require slowing the infusion rate or discontinuing NEXTERONE. In some patients, inserting a pacemaker is required. Have a temporary pacemaker available when treating a patient predisposed to bradycardia or AV block. 5.5 Hepatic Injury Acute hepatocellular necrosis leading to hepatic coma, acute renal failure, and death has been associated with the administration of intravenous amiodarone.  Intravenous infusions at much higher concentrations and rates of infusion than those recommended appear to increase this risk [ see ]. Dosage and Administration (2) Carefully monitor patients receiving NEXTERONE Premixed Injection for evidence of progressive hepatic injury. Consider reducing the rate of administration or withdrawing NEXTERONE Premixed Injection if hepatic injury occurs. 5.6 Proarrhythmia NEXTERONE Premixed Injection may cause a worsening of existing arrhythmias or precipitate a new arrhythmia, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes [ see ]. Proarrhythmia, primarily torsade de pointes (TdP), has been associated with prolongation, by intravenous amiodarone. Although QTc prolongation occurred frequently in patients receiving intravenous amiodarone, TdP or new-onset VF occurred infrequently (less than 2%). Monitor patients for QTc prolongation during infusion with NEXTERONE Premixed Injection. Reserve the combination of amiodarone with other antiarrhythmic therapies that prolong the QTc to patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent. Adverse Reactions (6.2) Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia whenever possible before initiating treatment with NEXTERONE Premixed Injection, as these disorders can exaggerate the degree of QTc prolongation and increase the potential for TdP. Give special attention to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and laxatives. 5.7 Pulmonary Injury Early-onset Pulmonary Toxicity There have been postmarketing reports of acute-onset (days to weeks) pulmonary injury in patients treated with intravenous amiodarone. Findings have included pulmonary infiltrates and masses on X-ray, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchospasm, wheezing, fever, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Two percent (2%) of patients were reported to have adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during clinical studies involving 48 hours of therapy. Some cases have progressed to respiratory failure or death.  Monitor for new respiratory symptoms and evaluate appropriately.  Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests in patients who are expected to be receiving amiodarone chronically. 5.8 Loss of Vision Cases of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis, usually resulting in visual impairment, have been reported in patients treated with oral amiodarone or intravenous amiodarone. In some cases, visual impairment has progressed to permanent blindness. Optic neuropathy and neuritis may occur at any time following initiation of therapy. Perform an ophthalmic examination if symptoms of visual impairment appear, such as changes in visual acuity and decreases in peripheral vision. Re-evaluate the necessity of amiodarone therapy if optic neuropathy or neuritis is suspected. 5.9 Thyroid Abnormalities NEXTERONE Premixed Injection inhibits peripheral conversion of throxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause increased T3 levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T3 (rT3) in clinically euthyroid patients. Monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction. Hyperthyroidism may induce arrhythmia breakthrough. If any new signs of arrhythmia appear, the possibility of hyperthyroidism should be considered. Antithyroid drugs, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The action of antithyroid drugs may be delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. NEXTERONE Premixed Injection induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing amiodarone and thyroid hormone supplementation. 5.10 Neonatal Injury Amiodarone can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Fetal exposure may increase the potential for adverse experiences including cardiac, thyroid, neurodevelopmental, neurological and growth effects in neonate. Inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus if NEXTERONE Premixed Injection is administered during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking NEXTERONE [ see ]. Pregnancy (8.1) 5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with intravenous amiodarone including shock (sometimes fatal), cardiac arrest, and the following manifestations: hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, cyanosis, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, flushing, hyperhidrosis and cold sweat. 5.12 Phlebitis Infusion site phlebitis has occurred in patients receiving intravenous amiodarone. Intravenous amiodarone concentrations greater than 3 mg/mL have been associated with a high incidence of peripheral vein phlebitis.",

In a total of 1836 patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 14% of patients received intravenous amiodarone for at least one week, 5% received it for at least 2 weeks, 2% received it for at least 3 weeks, and 1% received it for more than 3 weeks. The mean duration of therapy in these studies was 5.6 days; median exposure was 3.7 days. The most important adverse reactions were hypotension, asystole/cardiac arrest/pulseless electrical activity (PEA), cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, bradycardia, liver function test abnormalities, VT, and AV block. Overall, treatment was discontinued for about 9% of the patients because of adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of intravenous amiodarone therapy were hypotension (1.6%), asystole/cardiac arrest/PEA (1.2%), VT (1.1%), and cardiogenic shock (1%). Other adverse reactions reported in less than 2% of patients receiving intravenous amiodarone in controlled and uncontrolled studies included the following: abnormal kidney function, diarrhea, shock, sinus bradycardia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, VF, and vomiting. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience during or in close temporal relationship to intravenous amiodarone administration.
