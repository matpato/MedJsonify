In acute intestinal amebiasis , minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of MINOCIN \u00ae (minocycline) for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, MINOCIN \u00ae (minocycline) for Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Tooth Development MINOCIN, like other tetracycline-class antibacterials, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs, therefore, should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated. Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every six hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) including fatal cases have been reported with minocycline use. Fixed drug eruptions have occurred with minocycline and other tetracyclines. Worsening severity upon subsequent administrations, including generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, has been observed with other tetracyclines (see ). If severe skin reactions occur, discontinue MINOCIN immediately and institute appropriate therapy. ADVERSE REACTIONS Anti-anabolic Action The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours (See ). If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued. Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including MINOCIN \u00ae , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including Minocin. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and Minocin should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibacterial preparations, use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, the antibacterial should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline; therefore, minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibacterial therapy when indicated. MINOCIN \u00ae (minocycline) for Injection contains magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (See ). Because magnesium is excreted primarily by the kidney, serum levels of magnesium should be monitored in patients with renal impairment (See DESCRIPTION ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Because MINOCIN \u00ae (minocycline) for Injection contains magnesium (See ), close monitoring is recommended in patients with heart block or myocardial damage. DESCRIPTION Prescribing MINOCIN \u00ae for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including MINOCIN \u00ae (minocycline) for Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When MINOCIN \u00ae (minocycline) for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by MINOCIN \u00ae (minocycline) for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests Periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies should be performed. All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with minocycline should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri (See ). PRECAUTIONS Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines. MINOCIN \u00ae (minocycline) for Injection contains magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (See ). Potentially serious drug interactions may occur when intravenous magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is given concomitantly with CNS depressants, neuromuscular blocking agents and cardiac glycosides. DESCRIPTION Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long-term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production. Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs. In addition, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibacterial, oxytetracycline (i.e., adrenal and pituitary tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related antibacterials (tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline). Segment I (fertility and general reproduction) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects (See ) WARNINGS All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class antibacterials, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects (See ) WARNINGS Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. (See ). WARNINGS Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks (See ). WARNINGS Geriatric Use Clinical studies of intravenous minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (See , WARNINGS ).
