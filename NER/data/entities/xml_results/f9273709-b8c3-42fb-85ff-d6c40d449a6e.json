    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS UBRELVY is contraindicated: With concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] In patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity to ubrogepant or any component of UBRELVY. Reactions have included anaphylaxis, dyspnea, and facial or throat edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. ( 4 ) History of serious hypersensitivity to ubrogepant or any component of  UBRELVY. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue UBRELVY and initiate appropriate therapy.  Severe hypersensitivity reactions have included anaphylaxis and dyspnea. These  reactions can occur within minutes, hours, or days after administration. ( 5.1 ) Hypertension: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension may occur. ( 5.2 ) Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon: New-onset or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon may occur. ( 5.3 ) 5 .1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, facial or throat edema, rash, urticaria, and pruritus, have been reported with use of UBRELVY. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur minutes, hours, or days after administration. Most reactions occurred within hours after dosing and were not serious, and some reactions led to discontinuation. If a serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue UBRELVY and institute appropriate therapy [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . 5. 2 Hyper tension Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of CGRP antagonists, including UBRELVY, in the postmarketing setting. Some of the patients who developed\u00a0new-onset hypertension had risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment, but was most frequently reported within 7 days of therapy initiation. The CGRP antagonist\u00a0was discontinued in many of the reported cases. Monitor patients treated with UBRELVY for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of UBRELVY is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology or blood pressure is inadequately controlled. 5. 3 Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon Development of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including UBRELVY. In reported cases with small molecule CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 1.5 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms. UBRELVY should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] The most common adverse reactions (at least 2% and greater than placebo) were nausea and somnolence.

The safety of UBRELVY\u00a0was evaluated in 3,624 subjects who received at least one dose of UBRELVY.  In two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,\u00a0Phase 3 trials in adult patients with migraine (Studies 1 and 2), a total of 1,439\u00a0patients received UBRELVY\u00a050 mg or 100 mg [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Of the UBRELVY-treated patients in these 2 studies, approximately 89% were female, 82% were White, 15% were Black, and 17% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.\u00a0The mean age at study entry was 41 years (range of 18-75 years). Long-term safety was assessed in 813 patients, dosing intermittently for up to 1\u00a0year in an open-label extension study.  Patients were permitted to treat up to 8 migraines per month with UBRELVY.  Of these 813 patients, 421 patients were exposed to 50\u00a0mg or 100\u00a0mg for at least 6 months, and 364 patients were exposed to these doses for at least one year, all of whom treated at least two migraine attacks per month, on average.  In that study, 2.5% of patients were withdrawn from UBRELVY because of an adverse reaction.  The most common adverse reaction\u00a0resulting in discontinuation in the long-term safety study was nausea. Adverse reactions in Studies 1 and 2 are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Occurring in At Least 2% and at a Frequency Greater than Placebo in Studies 1 and 2 Placebo (N= 984) % UBRELVY 50 mg (N=954) % UBRELVY 100 mg (N=485) % Nausea 2 2 4 Somnolence* 1 2 3 Dry Mouth 1 <1 2 *Somnolence includes the adverse reaction-related terms sedation\u00a0and fatigue. 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of UBRELVY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
