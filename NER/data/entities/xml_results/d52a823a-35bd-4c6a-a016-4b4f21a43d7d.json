    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Hospitalization for Heart Failure: Increased in patients with a history of heart failure. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypertension: Worsening hypertension, including hypertensive crisis may occur. Monitor blood pressure. Adjust anti-hypertensive therapy as needed. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Erosion: Gastric or esophageal erosions and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Not indicated for treatment of anemia of CKD in patients who are not dialysis-dependent ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Malignancy: May have unfavorable effects on cancer growth. Not recommended if active malignancy. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Increased Risk of Death, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, Venous Thromboembolism, and Thrombosis of Vascular Access JESDUVROQ increases the risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events, that may be fatal, including myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism and vascular access thrombosis [see Boxed Warning, Adverse Reactions ( . Patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of these events. Avoid use in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, or acute coronary syndrome within the 3\u00a0months prior to starting JESDUVROQ. 6.1 )] A rate of hemoglobin rise of greater than 1 g/dL over 2 weeks may contribute to these risks. Targeting a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL is expected to further increase the risk of death and arterial and venous thrombotic events, as occurs with ESAs, which also increase erythropoietin levels. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, dose of JESDUVROQ, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Use the lowest dose of JESDUVROQ sufficient to reduce the need for red blood transfusions. Adherence to dosing and hemoglobin monitoring recommendations is important to avoid excessive erythropoiesis [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 )] Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, or thrombosis of vascular access. Evaluate and manage promptly if these occur. 5.2 Risk of Hospitalization for Heart Failure In the ASCEND-D trial, hospitalization for heart failure was observed in 7.5% (3.3 per 100 Person Years [PY]) of patients on dialysis receiving JESDUVROQ and 6.8% (3.0 per 100 PY) of patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). Patients with a pre-existing history of heart failure were at increased risk of hospitalization for heart failure with JESDUVROQ (14.5%; 6.8 per 100 PY) compared to rhEPO (11.3%; 5.1 per 100 PY). Consider the patient\u2019s history of heart failure when deciding whether to prescribe JESDUVROQ. Advise patients of the symptoms and signs of heart failure and to immediately report any worsening to their healthcare provider. 5.3 Hypertension JESDUVROQ is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In the ASCEND-D trial, worsening of hypertension occurred in 24% (12 per 100 PY) of patients receiving JESDUVROQ and 24% (12 per 100 PY) of patients receiving rhEPO [see Adverse Reactions ( . Serious worsening of hypertension occurred in 3.1% of patients receiving JESDUVROQ and 3.1% of patients receiving rhEPO. Cases of hypertensive crisis including hypertensive encephalopathy and seizures have also been reported in patients receiving JESDUVROQ. Periodically monitor blood pressure and adjust or initiate anti-hypertensive therapy as needed. 6.1 )] 5.4 Gastrointestinal Erosion In the ASCEND-D trial, gastric or esophageal erosions occurred in 5.7% (2.5 per 100 PY) of patients receiving JESDUVROQ and 6.6% (2.9 per 100 PY) of rhEPO-treated patients. Serious erosions, including gastrointestinal bleeding and the need for red blood cell transfusions, were reported in 3.6% and 3.1% of those receiving JESDUVROQ and rhEPO, respectively. Consider this risk particularly in patients at increased risk for gastrointestinal erosions, such as those with a history of gastrointestinal erosion, peptic ulcer disease, use of concomitant medications that increase the risk of gastrointestinal erosion, and current tobacco smokers and alcohol drinkers. Advise patients of the symptoms and signs of gastric and esophageal erosions and of gastrointestinal bleeding and to seek prompt medical care if these occur. 5.5 Serious Adverse Events in Patients with Anemia Due to Chronic Kidney Disease and Not on Dialysis The safety of JESDUVROQ has not been established for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in adults not on dialysis and its use is not recommended in this setting [see Indications and Usage ( . 1 )] In a large cardiovascular outcomes trial in adults with anemia of CKD who were not on dialysis (ASCEND-ND), an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, thromboembolism, serious acute kidney injury, hospitalization for heart failure, and serious gastrointestinal erosions was observed in patients treated with JESDUVROQ compared to rhEPO. 5.6 Malignancy Because increased hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 levels may be associated with unfavorable effects on cancer growth, JESDUVROQ has not been studied and is not recommended in patients with active malignancies. Malignancies were observed in 4.4% (1.9 per 100 PY) of patients treated with JESDUVROQ and 5.2% (2.3 per 100 PY) of patients treated with rhEPO. No evidence of increased carcinogenicity was observed in animal studies [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( . 13.1 )]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Increased Risk of Death, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, Venous Thromboembolism, and Thrombosis of Vascular Access [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )] \u2022 Risk of Hospitalization for Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] \u2022 Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] \u2022 Gastrointestinal Erosion [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.4 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226510%) are hypertension, thrombotic vascular events, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of JESDUVROQ was evaluated in adults with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease with anemia in the ASCEND-D trial based on an on-study analysis (on and off treatment) [see Clinical Studies ( . Patients were randomized to JESDUVROQ or rhEPO (epoetin alfa for patients on hemodialysis; darbepoetin alfa for patients on peritoneal dialysis). Of the 2,964 patients randomized in the trial, 1,487 were randomized to JESDUVROQ, 1,316 (88.5%) of whom were on hemodialysis and 171 (11.5%) of whom were on peritoneal dialysis. 14.1 )] The median extent of exposure to JESDUVROQ and rhEPO was similar. In the JESDUVROQ treatment arm, 65% of the participants were exposed to at least 18 months of JESDUVROQ and 29% of participants received JESDUVROQ for at least 2.5\u00a0years. JESDUVROQ was non-inferior to rhEPO on the time to first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with anemia due to CKD who were on dialysis [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.1 )] Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was reported in 19% of patients treated with JESDUVROQ and 18% of patients treated with rhEPO. No specific adverse reaction resulted in permanent treatment discontinuation in >1% of patients treated with JESDUVROQ. The most common adverse reactions (\u226510% of JESDUVROQ-treated patients) were hypertension, thrombotic vascular events, and abdominal pain. Table 4 lists the most common adverse reactions (reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JESDUVROQ).
