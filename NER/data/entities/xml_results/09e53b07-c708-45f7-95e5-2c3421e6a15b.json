Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and exfoliative dermatitis [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. 4.3 Concomitant Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators Do not use tadalafil tablets in patients who are using a GC stimulator, such as riociguat. PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of GC stimulators.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Evaluation of erectile dysfunction and BPH should include an appropriate medical assessment to identify potential underlying causes, as well as treatment options. Before prescribing tadalafil tablets, it is important to note the following: Patients should not use tadalafil tablets if sex is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status ( 5.1 ). Use of tadalafil tablets with alpha-blockers, antihypertensives or substantial amounts of alcohol (\u22655 units) may lead to hypotension ( 5.6 , 5.9 ). Tadalafil tablets are not recommended in combination with alpha-blockers for the treatment of BPH because efficacy of the combination has not been adequately studied and because of the risk of blood pressure lowering. Caution is advised when tadalafil tablets are used as a treatment for ED in men taking alpha-blockers. ( 2.7 , 5.6 , 7.1 , 12.2 ) Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts >4 hours. Use tadalafil tablets with caution in patients predisposed to priapism ( 5.3 ). Patients should stop tadalafil tablets and seek medical care if a sudden loss of vision occurs in one or both eyes, which could be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Tadalafil tablets should be used with caution, and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks, in patients with a history of NAION. Patients with a \u201ccrowded\u201d optic disc may also be at an increased risk of NAION ( 5.4 , 6.2 ). Patients should stop tadalafil tablets and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing ( 5.5 ). Prior to initiating treatment with tadalafil tablets for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms ( 5.14 ). 5.1 Cardiovascular Physicians should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients, since there is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity. Therefore, treatments for erectile dysfunction, including tadalafil tablets, should not be used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable as a result of their underlying cardiovascular status. Patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention. Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of tadalafil tablets. In such a patient, who has taken tadalafil tablets, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of tadalafil tablets before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking tadalafil tablets should seek immediate medical attention. [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17.1 )]. Patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction, (e.g., aortic stenosis and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) can be sensitive to the action of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in clinical safety and efficacy trials for tadalafil tablets, and therefore until further information is available, tadalafil tablets are not recommended for the following groups of patients: \u2022\u00a0myocardial infarction within the last 90 days \u2022\u00a0unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse \u2022\u00a0New York Heart Association Class 2 or greater heart failure in the last 6 months \u2022\u00a0uncontrolled arrhythmias, hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg), or uncontrolled hypertension \u2022\u00a0stroke within the last 6 months. As with other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil has mild systemic vasodilatory properties that may result in transient decreases in blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study, tadalafil 20 mg resulted in a mean maximal decrease in supine blood pressure, relative to placebo, of 1.6/0.8 mm Hg in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology ( While this effect should not be of consequence in most patients, prior to prescribing tadalafil tablets, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects. Patients with severely impaired autonomic control of blood pressure may be particularly sensitive to the actions of vasodilators, including PDE5 inhibitors. 12.2 )]. 5.2 Potential for Drug Interactions When Taking Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use Physicians should be aware that tadalafil tablets for once daily use provides continuous plasma tadalafil levels and should consider this when evaluating the potential for interactions with medications (e.g., nitrates, alpha-blockers, anti-hypertensives and potent inhibitors of CYP3A4) and with substantial consumption of alcohol [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2, 7.3 )]. 5.3 Prolonged Erection There have been rare reports of prolonged erections greater than 4 hours and priapism (painful erections greater than 6 hours in duration) for this class of compounds. Priapism, if not treated promptly, can result in irreversible damage to the erectile tissue. Patients who have an erection lasting greater than 4 hours, whether painful or not, should seek emergency medical attention. Tadalafil tablets should be used with caution in patients who have conditions that might predispose them to priapism (such as sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, or leukemia), or in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie\u2019s disease). 5.4 Effects on the Eye Physicians should advise patients to stop use of all phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets, and seek medical attention in the event of a sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes. Such an event may be a sign of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare condition and a cause of decreased vision, including permanent loss of vision, that has been reported rarely postmarketing in temporal association with the use of all PDE5 inhibitors. Based on published literature, the annual incidence of NAION is 2.5-11.8 cases per 100,000 in males aged \u226550. An observational case-crossover study evaluated the risk of NAION when PDE5 inhibitor use, as a class, occurred immediately before NAION onset (within 5 half-lives), compared to PDE5 inhibitor use in a prior time period. The results suggest an approximate 2-fold increase in the risk of NAION, with a risk estimate of 2.15 (95% CI 1.06, 4.34). A similar study reported a consistent result, with a risk estimate of 2.27 (95% CI 0.99, 5.20). Other risk factors for NAION, such as the presence of \u201ccrowded\u201d optic disc, may have contributed to the occurrence of NAION in these studies. Neither the rare postmarketing reports, nor the association of PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION in the observational studies, substantiate a causal relationship between PDE5 inhibitor use and NAION [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]. Physicians should consider whether their patients with underlying NAION risk factors could be adversely affected by use of PDE5 inhibitors. Individuals who have already experienced NAION are at increased risk of NAION recurrence. Therefore, PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets, should be used with caution in these patients and only when the anticipated benefits outweigh the risks. Individuals with \u201ccrowded\u201d optic disc are also considered at greater risk for NAION compared to the general population; however, evidence is insufficient to support screening of prospective users of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets, for this uncommon condition. Patients with known hereditary degenerative retinal disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, were not included in the clinical trials, and use in these patients is not recommended. 5.5 Sudden Hearing Loss Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. 5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for tadalafil tablets to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions ( Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. [see Drug Interactions ( , which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following: 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] ED \u2022\u00a0Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. \u2022\u00a0In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose. \u2022\u00a0In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor. \u2022\u00a0Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. BPH \u2022\u00a0The efficacy of the coadministration of an alpha-blocker and tadalafil tablets for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of tadalafil tablets and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH. [see Dosage and Administration ( \u2022\u00a0Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting tadalafil tablets for once daily use for the treatment of BPH. 2.7 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 .)]. 5.7 Renal Impairment Tadalafil Tablets for Use as Needed Tadalafil tablets should be limited to 5 mg not more than once in every 72 hours in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min or end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. The starting dose of tadalafil tablets in patients with creatinine clearance 30 \u2013 50 mL/min should be 5 mg not more than once per day, and the maximum dose should be limited to 10 mg not more than once in every 48 hours. [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.7 )] Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use ED Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, tadalafil tablets for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. BPH and ED/BPH Due to increased tadalafil exposure (AUC), limited clinical experience, and the lack of ability to influence clearance by dialysis, tadalafil tablets for once daily use is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. In patients with creatinine clearance 30 \u2013 50 mL/min, start dosing at 2.5 mg once daily, and increase the dose to 5 mg once daily based upon individual response [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Tadalafil Tablets for Use as Needed In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, the dose of tadalafil tablets should not exceed 10 mg. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of tadalafil tablets in this group is not recommended [see Use in Specific Populations ( Tadalafil tablets for once daily use has not been extensively evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised if tadalafil tablets for once daily use is prescribed to these patients. Because of insufficient information in patients with severe hepatic impairment, use of tadalafil tablets in this group is not recommended 8.6 )]. Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.9 Alcohol Patients should be made aware that both alcohol and tadalafil tablets, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood-pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Therefore, physicians should inform patients that substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with tadalafil tablets can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. 5.10 Concomitant Use of Potent Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) Tadalafil tablets are metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 in the liver. The dose of tadalafil tablets for use as needed should be limited to 10 mg no more than once every 72 hours in patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, and itraconazole [see Drug Interactions ( In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 and tadalafil tablets for once daily use, the maximum recommended dose is 2.5 mg 7.2 )]. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. 5.11 Combination With Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Erectile Dysfunction Therapies The safety and efficacy of combinations of tadalafil tablets and other PDE5 inhibitors or treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Inform patients not to take tadalafil tablets with other PDE5 inhibitors, including ADCIRCA. 5.12 Effects on Bleeding Studies in vitro have demonstrated that tadalafil is a selective inhibitor of PDE5. PDE5 is found in platelets. When administered in combination with aspirin, tadalafil 20 mg did not prolong bleeding time, relative to aspirin alone. Tadalafil tablets have not been administered to patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration. Although tadalafil tablets has not been shown to increase bleeding times in healthy subjects, use in patients with bleeding disorders or significant active peptic ulceration should be based upon a careful risk-benefit assessment and caution. 5.13 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases The use of tadalafil tablets offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) should be considered. 5.14 Consideration of Other Urological Conditions Prior to Initiating Treatment for BPH Prior to initiating treatment with tadalafil tablets for BPH, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, prostate cancer and BPH may coexist.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22652%) include headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, nasal congestion, flushing, and pain in limb ( 6.1 ).

Tadalafil was administered to over 9000 men during clinical trials worldwide. In trials of tadalafil tablets for once daily use, a total of 1434, 905, and 115 were treated for at least 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, respectively. For tadalafil tablets for use as needed, over 1300 and 1000 subjects were treated for at least 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Tadalafil tablets\u00a0for Use as Needed for ED In eight primary placebo-controlled clinical studies of 12 weeks duration, mean age was 59 years (range 22 to 88) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil 10 or 20 mg was 3.1%, compared to 1.4% in placebo treated patients. When taken as recommended in the placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse reactions were reported ( see Table 1 ) for tadalafil tablets for use as needed: Table 1: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22652% of Patients Treated with Tadalafil Tablets (10 or 20 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in the Eight Primary Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies (Including a Study in Patients with Diabetes) for Tadalafil Tablets for Use as Needed for ED Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=476) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=151) Tadalafil 10 mg (N=394) Tadalafil 20 mg (N=635) Headache 5% 11% 11% 15% Dyspepsia 1% 4% 8% 10% Back pain 3% 3% 5% 6% Myalgia 1% 1% 4% 3% Nasal congestion 1% 2% 3% 3% Flushing a 1% 2% 3% 3% Pain in limb 1% 1% 3% 3% a The term flushing includes: facial flushing and flushing Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for ED In three placebo-controlled clinical trials of 12 or 24 weeks duration, mean age was 58 years (range 21 to 82) and the discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients treated with tadalafil was 4.1%, compared to 2.8% in placebo-treated patients.

Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation reported by at least 2 patients treated with tadalafil included headache, upper abdominal pain, and myalgia. The following adverse reactions were reported (see Table 4). Table 4: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported by \u22651% of Patients Treated with Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use (5 mg) and More Frequent on Drug than Placebo in Three Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of 12 Weeks Treatment Duration, including Two Studies for Tadalafil Tablets for Once Daily Use for BPH and One Study for ED and BPH Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=576) Tadalafil 5 mg (N=581) Headache 2.3% 4.1% Dyspepsia 0.2% 2.4% Back pain 1.4% 2.4% Nasopharyngitis 1.6% 2.1% Diarrhea 1.0% 1.4% Pain in extremity 0.0% 1.4% Myalgia 0.3% 1.2% Dizziness 0.5% 1.0% Additional, less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) reported in the controlled clinical trials of tadalafil tablets for BPH or ED and BPH included: gastroesophageal reflux disease, upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and muscle spasm. Back pain or myalgia was reported at incidence rates described in Tables 1 through 4. In tadalafil clinical pharmacology trials, back pain or myalgia generally occurred 12 to 24 hours after dosing and typically resolved within 48 hours. The back pain/myalgia associated with tadalafil treatment was characterized by diffuse bilateral lower lumbar, gluteal, thigh, or thoracolumbar muscular discomfort and was exacerbated by recumbency. In general, pain was reported as mild or moderate in severity and resolved without medical treatment, but severe back pain was reported with a low frequency (<5% of all reports). When medical treatment was necessary, acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were generally effective; however, in a small percentage of subjects who required treatment, a mild narcotic (e.g., codeine) was used. Overall, approximately 0.5% of all subjects treated with tadalafil tablets for on demand use discontinued treatment as a consequence of back pain/myalgia. In the 1-year open label extension study, back pain and myalgia were reported in 5.5% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Diagnostic testing, including measures for inflammation, muscle injury, or renal damage revealed no evidence of medically significant underlying pathology. Incidence rates for tadalafil tablets for once daily use for ED, BPH and BPH/ED are described in Tables 2, 3 and 4. In studies of tadalafil tablets for once daily use, adverse reactions of back pain and myalgia were generally mild or moderate with a discontinuation rate of <1% across all indications. Across placebo-controlled studies with tadalafil tablets for use as needed for ED, diarrhea was reported more frequently in patients 65 years of age and older who were treated with tadalafil tablets (2.5% of patients) [see Use in Specific Populations ( Across all studies with any tadalafil tablets dose, reports of changes in color vision were rare (<0.1% of patients). 8.5 )]. The following section identifies additional, less frequent events (<2%) reported in controlled clinical trials of tadalafil tablets for once daily use or use as needed. A causal relationship of these events to tadalafil tablets is uncertain. Excluded from this list are those events that were minor, those with no plausible relation to drug use, and reports too imprecise to be meaningful: \u2014 asthenia, face edema, fatigue, pain, peripheral edema Body as a Whole \u2014 angina pectoris, chest pain, hypotension, myocardial infarction, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia Cardiovascular \u2014 abnormal liver function tests, dry mouth, dysphagia, esophagitis, gastritis, GGTP increased, loose stools, nausea, upper abdominal pain, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage Digestive \u2014 arthralgia, neck pain Musculoskeletal \u2014 dizziness, hypesthesia, insomnia, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo Nervous \u2014 renal impairment Renal and Urinary \u2014 dyspnea, epistaxis, pharyngitis Respiratory \u2014 pruritus, rash, sweating Skin and Appendages \u2014 blurred vision, changes in color vision, conjunctivitis (including conjunctival hyperemia), eye pain, lacrimation increase, swelling of eyelids Ophthalmologic \u2014 sudden decrease or loss of hearing, tinnitus Otologic \u2014 erection increased, spontaneous penile erection Urogenital 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tadalafil tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These events have been chosen for inclusion either due to their seriousness, reporting frequency, lack of clear alternative causation, or a combination of these factors. \u2014 Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, stroke, chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia, have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of tadalafil. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of tadalafil tablets without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of tadalafil tablets and sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to tadalafil tablets, to sexual activity, to the patient\u2019s underlying cardiovascular disease, to a combination of these factors, or to other factors Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular [see Warnings and Precautions ( \u2014 hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and exfoliative dermatitis 5.1 )].

Most, but not all, of these patients had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for development of NAION, including but not necessarily limited to: low cup to disc ratio (\u201ccrowded disc\u201d), age over 50, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, and smoking [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.4) \u2014 Cases of sudden decrease or loss of hearing have been reported postmarketing in temporal association with the use of PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets. In some of the cases, medical conditions and other factors were reported that may have also played a role in the otologic adverse events. In many cases, medical follow-up information was limited. It is not possible to determine whether these reported events are related directly to the use of tadalafil tablets, to the patient\u2019s underlying risk factors for hearing loss, a combination of these factors, or to other factors Otologic [see Warnings and Precautions ( \u2014 priapism 5.5 )].
