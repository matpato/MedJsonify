    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Patients treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Interrupt and evaluate patients with new or worsening respiratory symptoms suspected to be due to ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue KISQALI in patients with recurrent symptomatic or severe ILD/pneumonitis. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs): Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug-reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can occur with KISQALI treatment. Permanently discontinue KISQALI in patients with SCARs or other life-threatening cutaneous reactions. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) QT Interval Prolongation: Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes prior to initiation of treatment with KISQALI. Repeat ECGs at approximately Day 14 of the first cycle, and as clinically indicated. Monitor electrolytes at the beginning of each cycle for 6 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Avoid using KISQALI with drugs known to prolong QT interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors. ( 2.2 , 5.3 , 7.1 , 7.4 ) Increased QT Prolongation with Concomitant Use of Tamoxifen: KISQALI is not indicated for concomitant use with tamoxifen. ( 5.4 ) Hepatotoxicity: Increases in serum transaminase and bilirubin levels have been observed. Perform liver function tests (LFTs) before initiating treatment with KISQALI. Monitor LFTs every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Neutropenia: Perform complete blood count (CBC) before initiating therapy with KISQALI. Monitor CBC every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated. ( 2.2 , 5.6 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during therapy. ( 5.7 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with KISQALI and other CDK 4/6 inhibitors. In patients with early breast cancer (NATALEE) who received 400 mg KISQALI plus a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI), 1.5% of patients had ILD/pneumonitis (Grade 1-2). In patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-3, MONALEESA-7), 1.6% of patients had ILD/pneumonitis (any Grade, 0.4% had Grade 3-4, and 0.1% had a fatal outcome). Additional cases of ILD/pneumonitis have occurred in the postmarketing setting, some resulting in death [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis which may include hypoxia, cough, and dyspnea. In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms suspected to be due to ILD or pneumonitis, interrupt KISQALI immediately and evaluate the patient. Permanently discontinue KISQALI in patients with severe ILD/pneumonitis or any recurrent symptomatic ILD/pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS)/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can occur in patients treated with KISQALI [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . If signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous reactions occur, interrupt KISQALI until the etiology of the reaction has been determined [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Early consultation with a dermatologist is recommended to ensure greater diagnostic accuracy and appropriate management. If SJS, TEN, or DiHS/DRESS is confirmed, permanently discontinue KISQALI. Do not reintroduce KISQALI in patients who have experienced SCARs or other life-threatening cutaneous reactions during KISQALI treatment. 5.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0QT Interval Prolongation KISQALI has been shown to prolong the QT interval in a concentration-dependent manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Avoid KISQALI in patients who are at significant risk of developing Torsades de Pointes (TdP), including those with: congenital long QT syndrome; uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease, recent myocardial infarction, heart failure, unstable angina, bradyarrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, high degree atrioventricular block, severe aortic stenosis, or uncontrolled hypothyroidism; electrolyte abnormalities; taking drugs known to prolong QT interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors as this may lead to prolongation of the QTcF interval. Based on the observed QT prolongation during treatment, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7.4)] . In patients with early breast cancer (NATALEE) who received 400 mg KISQALI plus NSAI, 8 out of 2494 patients (0.3%) had > 500 ms post-baseline QTcF interval value and 50 out of 2494 patients (2%) had > 60 ms QTcF increase from baseline. QTcF prolongation was reversible with dose interruption. The majority of QTcF prolongation occurred within the first four weeks of KISQALI. There were no reported cases of Torsades de Pointes. In patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-3, and MONALEESA-7) who received 600 mg KISQALI plus NSAI or fulvestrant, 15 out of 1054 patients (1.4%) had a > 500 ms post-baseline QTcF value and 61 out of 1054 patients (6%) had a > 60 ms QTcF increase from baseline. QTcF prolongation was reversible with dose interruption. The majority of QTcF prolongation occurred within the first four weeks of KISQALI. There were no reported cases of Torsades de Pointes. In MONALEESA-2, in the KISQALI plus letrozole treatment arm, there was one (0.3%) sudden death in a patient with Grade 3 hypokalemia and Grade 2 QT prolongation. No cases of sudden death were reported in MONALEESA-7 or MONALEESA-3 [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Perform ECG in all patients prior to starting KISQALI. Initiate treatment with KISQALI only in patients with QTcF values less than 450 ms. Repeat ECG at approximately Day 14 of the first cycle, and as clinically indicated. Monitor serum electrolytes (including potassium, calcium, phosphorous and magnesium) prior to the initiation of KISQALI at the beginning of the first 6 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Correct any abnormality before starting KISQALI [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Increased QT Prolongation with Concomitant Use of Tamoxifen Avoid use of tamoxifen with KISQALI. In MONALEESA-7, the observed mean QTcF increase from baseline was > 10 ms higher in the tamoxifen plus placebo subgroup compared with the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) plus placebo subgroup. In the placebo arm, an increase of > 60 ms from baseline occurred in 6/90 (7%) of patients receiving tamoxifen, and in no patients receiving an NSAI. An increase of > 60 ms from baseline in the QTcF interval was observed in 14/87 (16%) of patients in the KISQALI and tamoxifen combination and in 18/245 (7%) of patients receiving KISQALI plus an NSAI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 5.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hepatotoxicity In patients with early and advanced or metastatic breast cancer, drug-induced liver injury and increases in transaminases occurred with KISQALI. In patients with early breast cancer (NATALEE) treated with KISQALI, drug-induced liver injury was reported in 9 patients (0.4%), of which 5 were Grade \u2265 3, and 8 had resolved as of the data cutoff. There were 8 (0.3%) clinically confirmed Hy\u2019s Law cases (including 4 out of 9 drug-induced liver injury mentioned above), 6 of which had resolved within 303 days and 2 of which were improving, all after discontinuation of KISQALI. Grade 3 or 4 increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occurred in 8% and 4.7% respectively; including Grade 4 increases in ALT (1.5%) and AST (0.8%). In patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7 and MONALEESA-3) treated with KISQALI Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT and AST occurred in 11% and 8%, respectively. Among the patients who had Grade \u2265 3 ALT/AST elevation, the median time-to-onset was 92 days for the KISQALI plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant treatment arms. The median time to resolution to Grade \u2264 2 was 21 days in the KISQALI plus aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant treatment arms. In MONALEESA-2 and MONALEESA-3, concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than three times the ULN and total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN, with normal alkaline phosphatase, in the absence of cholestasis (Hy\u2019s Law) occurred in 6 (1%) patients and all patients recovered after discontinuation of KISQALI. Perform liver function tests (LFTs) in all patients before initiating KISQALI. Monitor LFTs every 2 weeks for first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each of the subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . Based on the severity of the transaminase elevations, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation as described in Table 5 (Dose Modification and Management for Hepatobiliary Toxicity) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neutropenia KISQALI causes concentration-dependent neutropenia. In patients with early breast cancer (NATALEE) who received KISQALI plus NSAI, 94%, including 45% of Grade 3 or 4, had a decrease in neutrophil counts (based on laboratory findings), 63% had an adverse reaction of neutropenia, and 0.3% had febrile neutropenia. The median time to Grade \u2265 2 neutropenia was 18 days. The median time to resolution of Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia to Grade < 3 was 10 days. Treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia was required in 1.1% of patients. In patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-7, and MONALEESA-3) who received KISQALI plus NSAI or fulvestrant, 75% had neutropenia, 62% had Grade 3 or 4 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings), and 1.7% had febrile neutropenia. The median time to Grade \u2265 2 neutropenia was 17 days. The median time to resolution of Grade \u2265 3 neutropenia to Grade < 3 was 12 days. Treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia was required in 1% of patients. Perform a complete blood count (CBC) in all patients before initiating KISQALI. Monitor CBC every 2 weeks for the first 2 cycles, at the beginning of each subsequent 4 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the neutropenia, KISQALI may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation as described in Table 6 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 5.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, KISQALI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of ribociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicities at maternal exposures that were 0.6 and 1.5 times the human clinical exposure, respectively, based on area under the curve (AUC). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with KISQALI and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] .",

In addition, the pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to KISQALI in 1065 patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-3, MONALEESA-7), of whom 76% were exposed for 6 months or longer, and 62% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were leukocytes decreased (95%), neutrophils decreased (93%), hemoglobin decreased (68%), lymphocytes decreased (66%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (55%), gamma-glutamyl transferase increased (53%), alanine aminotransferase increased (52%), infections (47%), nausea (47%), creatinine increased (42%), fatigue (35%), platelets decreased (34%), diarrhea (33%), vomiting (29%), headache (27%), constipation (25%), alopecia (25%), cough (24%), rash (24%), back pain (24%), and glucose serum decreased (20%). NATALEE: KISQALI in Combination with a Non-steroidal Aromatase Inhibitor as Adjuvant Treatment Adults with HR-positive, HER2-negative Stage II and III Early Breast Cancer at High Risk of Recurrence The safety of KISQALI was evaluated in NATALEE, a clinical trial of 5101 patients who received KISQALI plus NSAI or NSAI alone, with or without goserelin [see Clinical Studies (14)] . The median duration of exposure to KISQALI was 33 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients who received KISQALI. Serious adverse reactions in > 0.5% of patients who received KISQALI included COVID-19 (1.1%), pneumonia (0.8%), and pulmonary embolism (0.6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.6% of patients who received KISQALI. Fatal adverse reactions in \u2265 0.1% of patients receiving KISQALI included COVID-19 or COVID-19 pneumonia (0.2%) and pulmonary embolism (0.1%). Permanent discontinuation of KISQALI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 20% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of KISQALI in \u2265 2% of patients were alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase increased (8%). Dosage interruptions of both KISQALI plus NSAI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 73% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u2265 5% of patients included neutropenia or neutrophil count decreased (43%), alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase increased (11%), COVID-19 (10%), and hypomagnesemia (5%). Dose reductions of KISQALI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in \u2265 2% of patients included neutropenia or neutrophil count decreased (14%) and liver function abnormal (2.3%). The most common (\u2265 20% on KISQALI plus NSAI and \u2265 2% higher than placebo) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were neutropenia, infections, nausea, headache, fatigue, leukopenia, and abnormal liver function tests.
