Continue, withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on severity. ( 5.1 ) Left Ventricular Dysfunction : Assess ejection fraction by echocardiogram prior to initiating GOMEKLI, every 3 months during the first year, then as clinically indicated thereafter. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on severity. ( 5.2 ) Dermatologic Adverse Reactions : Initiate supportive care at first signs of dermatologic adverse reactions including rash. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on severity. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Ocular Toxicity GOMEKLI\u00a0can\u00a0cause\u00a0ocular\u00a0toxicity\u00a0including\u00a0retinal\u00a0vein\u00a0occlusion\u00a0(RVO),\u00a0retinal\u00a0pigment epithelium detachment (RPED), and blurred vision. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], ocular toxicity occurred in 25%\u00a0of\u00a0patients\u00a0treated\u00a0with\u00a0GOMEKLI:\u00a020%\u00a0were\u00a0Grade\u00a01\u00a0reactions,\u00a03.8%\u00a0were\u00a0Grade\u00a02 reactions, and 0.8% were Grade 3 reactions. Adult Patients In the adult pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], ocular toxicity occurred in 28% of patients treated with GOMEKLI: 21% were Grade 1 reactions, 5% were Grade 2 reactions and 1.3% were Grade 3 reactions. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) occurred in 2.7% of adult patients, including one Grade 3 reaction which required permanent discontinuation of\u00a0GOMEKLI.\u00a0RPED\u00a0occurred\u00a0in\u00a0one\u00a0adult\u00a0patient\u00a0(1.3%).\u00a0Blurred\u00a0vision\u00a0occurred\u00a0in\u00a09%\u00a0of adult patients treated with GOMEKLI. Pediatric Patients In\u00a0the\u00a0pediatric\u00a0pooled\u00a0safety\u00a0population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ], ocular\u00a0toxicity occurred in 19% of patients: 17% were Grade 1 and 1.7% were Grade 2. Conduct comprehensive ophthalmic assessments prior to initiating GOMEKLI, at regular intervals during treatment, and to evaluate any new or worsening visual changes such as blurred\u00a0vision.\u00a0Continue,\u00a0withhold,\u00a0reduce\u00a0the\u00a0dose,\u00a0or\u00a0permanently\u00a0discontinue\u00a0GOMEKLI as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 5.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction GOMEKLI can cause left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with GOMEKLI has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <55% prior to initiation of treatment. In the ReNeu study, in adult and pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , decreased LVEF of 10 to <20% occurred in 20%, and decreased LVEF of \u226520% occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with GOMEKLI. All patients with decreased LVEF were identified during routine echocardiography. Decreased LVEF resolved in 75% of these patients. Adult Patients In adult patients in the ReNeu study [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , decreased LVEF of 10 to\u00a0<20% occurred in 16% of adult patients treated with GOMEKLI. Of the adult patients with decreased LVEF, five patients (9%) required dose interruption, one patient (1.7%) required a dose reduction and one patient required permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI. The median time to first onset of decreased LVEF in adult patients was 70 days. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients in the ReNeu study [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] , decreased LVEF of 10 to <20% occurred in 25%, and decreased LVEF of \u226520% occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with GOMEKLI. Of the pediatric patients with decreased LVEF, one patient (1.8%) required dose interruption of GOMEKLI. The median time to first onset of decreased LVEF in pediatric patients was 132 days. Before initiating GOMEKLI, assess ejection fraction (EF) by echocardiogram. Monitor EF every 3 months during the first year and then as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on the severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. 5.3 Dermatologic Adverse Reactions GOMEKLI\u00a0can\u00a0cause\u00a0dermatologic\u00a0adverse\u00a0reactions\u00a0including rash.

In ReNeu, a pregnancy reported 31 days after the last dose of GOMEKLI resulted in a first trimester spontaneous abortion. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mirdametinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal mortality, structural abnormalities and alterations to growth at doses approximately equivalent to the human clinical dose of 2 mg/m 2 twice daily based on body surface area (BSA). Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of GOMEKLI. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GOMEKLI and for 6 weeks after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GOMEKLI and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 ) ].",

The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to GOMEKLI in 133 patients (75 adults and 58 pediatric patients) in the ReNeu study [see Clinical Studies (14) ] (n=114) and Study NF-106 (n=19) [NCT-02096471]. Patients received GOMEKLI 2 mg/m 2 orally twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among 133 patients who received GOMEKLI, 62% were exposed for one year or longer, 38% were exposed for 2 years or longer, and 12% were exposed for 3 years or longer. Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Associated Plexiform Neurofibromas The safety of GOMEKLI was evaluated in the ReNeu study [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Eligible patients were 2 years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who had symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (PN). Patients were excluded for abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), uncontrolled hypertension, alanine transaminase (ALT) value of >2 \u00d7 upper limit of normal (ULN), any current or history of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or retinal pigment epithelium detachment (RPED), intraocular pressure >21 mmHg (or upper limit of normal adjusted by age), and history of glaucoma. Patients received GOMEKLI 2 mg/m2 orally twice daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Adult Patients The median age of adult patients (age \u226518) who received GOMEKLI was 35 years (range: 18-69); 64% were female; 85% were White, 9% were Black or African American, 3.4% were Asian, 3.4% were other races or race not reported; and 1.7% were Hispanic or Latino. For adult patients treated with GOMEKLI, the median duration of treatment was 22 months (range: 0.4 to 46 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 17% of adult patients who received GOMEKLI. Serious adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of patients were COVID-19 (3.4%),\u00a0nephrolithiasis (3.4%), and in 1 patient each: acute kidney injury, abdominal pain, ischemic colitis, urinary tract infection, retinal vein occlusion, scoliosis, squamous cell carcinoma of skin, cerebrovascular accident and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One fatal adverse reaction occurred in an adult patient (1.7%) who received GOMEKLI, due to COVID-19. Permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 22% of adult patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI in \u22651% of adult patients were rash, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, alopecia, dry skin, left ventricular dysfunction, cough, wheezing, COVID-19, peripheral swelling, RVO, dizziness, and vomiting. Dosage interruptions of GOMEKLI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 31% of adult patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u22655% of patients included left ventricular dysfunction and COVID-19. Dose reductions of GOMEKLI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 17% of adult patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in \u22655% of patients included rash. The most common adverse reactions (>25%) were rash, diarrhea, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, and fatigue. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality (>2%) was increased creatine phosphokinase. Pediatric Patients The median age of pediatric patients (age \u226417 years) who received GOMEKLI was 10 years (range: 2 to 17); 54% were female; 66% were White, 20% were Black or African American, 9% were other races or race not reported, 3.6% were Asian, 1.8% were American Indian or Alaska Native; and 14% were Hispanic or Latino. For pediatric patients treated with GOMEKLI, the median duration of treatment was 22 months (range: 1.6 to 40 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 14% of pediatric patients who received GOMEKLI. Serious adverse reactions in \u22651% of patients included viral gastrointestinal infections (3.6%) and in 1 patient each: diplopia, musculoskeletal pain, seizure, fall, femoral neck fracture, dehydration and hypertension. Permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9% of pediatric patients. Adverse reactions that required permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI in \u22651% of patients were urticaria, rash, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. Dosage interruptions of GOMEKLI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30% of pediatric patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u22655% of patients included COVID-19. Dose reductions of GOMEKLI due to an adverse reaction occurred in 13% of pediatric patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage reduction in \u22653% of pediatric patients were rash and decreased neutrophil count. The most common adverse reactions (>25%) were rash, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, paronychia, left ventricular dysfunction, and nausea.
