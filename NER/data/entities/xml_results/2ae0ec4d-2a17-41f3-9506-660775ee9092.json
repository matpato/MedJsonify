    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Ocular Toxicity : Conduct comprehensive ophthalmic assessments prior to initiating GOMEKLI, at regular intervals during treatment and for new or worsening visual changes or blurred vision. Continue, withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on severity. ( 5.1 ) Left Ventricular Dysfunction : Assess ejection fraction by echocardiogram prior to initiating GOMEKLI, every 3 months during the first year, then as clinically indicated thereafter. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on severity. ( 5.2 ) Dermatologic Adverse Reactions : Initiate supportive care at first signs of dermatologic adverse reactions including rash. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on severity. ( 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Ocular Toxicity GOMEKLI can cause ocular toxicity including retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) , retinal pigment epithelium detachment ( RPED ) , and blurred vision. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , ocular toxicity occurred in 25% of patients treated with GOMEKLI: 20% were Grade 1 reactions, 3.8% were Grade 2 reactions, and 0.8% were Grade 3 reactions. Adult Patients In the adult pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , ocular toxicity occurred in 28% of patients treated with GOMEKLI: 21% were Grade 1 reactions, 5% were Grade 2 reactions and 1.3% were Grade 3 reactions. Retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) occurred in 2.7% of adult patients, including one Grade 3 reaction which required permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI. RPED occurred in one adult patient ( 1.3% ) . Blurred vision occurred in 9% of adult patients treated with GOMEKLI. Pediatric Patients In the pediatric pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , ocular toxicity occurred in 19% of patients: 17% were Grade 1 and 1.7% were Grade 2. Conduct comprehensive ophthalmic assessments prior to initiating GOMEKLI, at regular intervals during treatment, and to evaluate any new or worsening visual changes such as blurred vision. Continue, withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI as clinically indicated [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] . 5.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction GOMEKLI can cause left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with GOMEKLI has not been studied in patients with a history of clinically significant cardiac disease or LVEF <55% prior to initiation of treatment. In the ReNeu study, in adult and pediatric patients [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , decreased LVEF of 10 to <20% occurred in 20% , and decreased LVEF of \u226520% occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with GOMEKLI. All patients with decreased LVEF were identified during routine echocardiography. Decreased LVEF resolved in 75% of these patients. Adult Patients In adult patients in the ReNeu study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , decreased LVEF of 10 to <20% occurred in 16% of adult patients treated with GOMEKLI. Of the adult patients with decreased LVEF, five patients ( 9% ) required dose interruption, one patient ( 1.7% ) required a dose reduction and one patient required permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI. The median time to first onset of decreased LVEF in adult patients was 70 days. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients in the ReNeu study [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , decreased LVEF of 10 to <20% occurred in 25% , and decreased LVEF of \u226520% occurred in 1.8% of patients treated with GOMEKLI. Of the pediatric patients with decreased LVEF, one patient ( 1.8% ) required dose interruption of GOMEKLI. The median time to first onset of decreased LVEF in pediatric patients was 132 days. Before initiating GOMEKLI, assess ejection fraction ( EF ) by echocardiogram. Monitor EF every 3 months during the first year and then as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on the severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] . 5.3 Dermatologic Adverse Reactions GOMEKLI can cause dermatologic adverse reactions including rash. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , rash occurred in 84% of patients treated with GOMEKLI: 31% were Grade 2, and 6% were Grade 3. The most frequent rashes ( \u22652% ) included dermatitis acneiform ( 65% ) , rash ( 11% ) , eczema ( 8% ) , maculo-papular rash ( 4.5% ) and pustular rash ( 3.8% ) . Adult Patients In the pooled adult safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , rash occurred in 92% of patients treated with GOMEKLI: 37% were Grade 2 and 8% were Grade 3 reactions. Rash requiring permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI occurred in 11% of adult patients. Pediatric Patients In the pooled pediatric safety population [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] , rash occurred in 72% of patients treated with GOMEKLI: 22% were Grade 2 and 3.4% were Grade 3 reactions. Rash resulting in permanent discontinuation of GOMEKLI occurred in 3.4% of pediatric patients. Dermatitis acneiform occurred with a higher frequency in patients aged 12 to 17 years ( 77% ) than those aged 2 to 11 years ( 16% ) , while non-acneiform rashes occurred with a higher frequency in patients aged 2 to 11 years ( 53% ) than those aged 12 to 17 years ( 15% ) . Initiate supportive care at first signs of dermatologic adverse reactions. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue GOMEKLI based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) ] . 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from clinical trials, animal studies and its mechanism of action, GOMEKLI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In ReNeu, a pregnancy reported 31 days after the last dose of GOMEKLI resulted in a first trimester spontaneous abortion. In embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of mirdametinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal mortality, structural abnormalities and alterations to growth at doses approximately equivalent to the human clinical dose of 2 mg/m 2 twice daily based on body surface area ( BSA ) . Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of GOMEKLI. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GOMEKLI and for 6 weeks after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with GOMEKLI and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) ] .",
