    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE 10% Calcium Chloride Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of hypocalcemia in those conditions requiring a prompt increase in plasma calcium levels.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "PRECAUTIONS Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. Discard unused portion. Because of its additive effect, calcium should be administered very cautiously to a patient who is digitalized or who is taking effective doses of digitalis or digitalis-like preparations. Injections should be made slowly through a small needle into a large vein to minimize venous irritation and avoid undesirable reactions. It is particularly important to prevent a high concentration of calcium from reaching the heart because of the danger of cardiac syncope. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness are based on similar clinical conditions in children and adults. Pregnancy: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with calcium chloride. It also is not known whether calcium chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity. Calcium chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Geriatric Use: An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Rapid injection may cause the patient to complain of tingling sensations, a calcium taste, a sense of oppression or \u201cheat wave\u201d. Injections of calcium chloride are accompanied by peripheral vasodilatation as well as a local \u201cburning\u201d sensation and there may be a moderate fall in blood pressure. Should perivascular infiltration occur, I.V. administration at that site should be discontinued at once. Local infiltration of the affected area with 1% procaine hydrochloride, to which hyaluronidase may be added, will often reduce venospasm and dilute the calcium remaining in the tissues locally. Local application of heat may also be helpful.",
