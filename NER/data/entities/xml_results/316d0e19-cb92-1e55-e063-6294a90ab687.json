In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, 184 patients with ALS were administered edaravone injection 60 mg in treatment cycles for 6 months. The population consisted of Japanese patients who had a median age of 60 years (range 29-75) and were 59% male. Most (93%) of these patients were living independently at the time of screening. Most Common Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Studies Table 2 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of patients in the edaravone injection-treated group and that occurred at least 2% more frequently than in the placebo-treated group in randomized placebo-controlled ALS trials. The most common adverse reactions that occurred in \u226510% of edaravone injection-treated patients were contusion, gait disturbance, and headache.

CLINICAL STUDIES (14) ] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of edaravone injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
