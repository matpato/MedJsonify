    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Neutropenia : Monitor peripheral blood cell counts and adjust dose as appropriate. ( 5.1 ) Peripheral Neuropathy : Monitor for signs of neuropathy. Manage with dose delay and adjustment. ( 5.2 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.3 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) QT Prolongation : Monitor for prolonged QT intervals in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, and electrolyte abnormalities. Avoid in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Neutropenia In Study 1, severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) lasting more than one week occurred in 12% (62/503) of patients with metastatic breast cancer, leading to discontinuation in <1% of patients. Febrile neutropenia (fever \u226538.5\u00b0C with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia) occurred in 5% (23/503) of patients; two patients (0.4%) died from complications of febrile neutropenia [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] In Study 1, patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3 \u00d7 ULN (upper limit of normal) experienced a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia than patients with normal aminotransferase levels. Patients with bilirubin > 1.5 \u00d7 ULN also had a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. In Study 2, severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) lasting more than one week occurred in 12% (26/222) of patients with liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 0.9% of patients treated with eribulin mesylate and fatal neutropenic sepsis in 0.9% [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose; increase the frequency of monitoring in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias. Delay administration of eribulin mesylate and reduce subsequent doses in patients who experience febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days [see Dosage and Administration ( . Clinical studies of eribulin mesylate did not include patients with baseline neutrophil counts below 1,500/mm 2.2 )] 3 . 5.2 Peripheral Neuropathy In Study 1, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8% (40/503) of patients, and Grade 4 in 0.4% (2/503) of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Peripheral neuropathy was the most common toxicity leading to discontinuation of eribulin mesylate (5% of patients; 24/503) in Study 1. Neuropathy lasting more than one year occurred in 5% (26/503) of patients. Twenty-two percent (109/503) of patients developed a new or worsening neuropathy that had not recovered within a median follow-up duration of 269 days (range 25 to 662 days). In Study 2, Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 3.1% (7/223) of eribulin mesylate -treated patients. Peripheral neuropathy led to discontinuation of eribulin mesylate in 0.9% of patients. The median time to first occurrence of peripheral neuropathy of any severity was 5 months (range: 3.5 months to 9 months). Neuropathy lasting more than 60 days occurred in 58% (38/65) of patients. Sixty three percent (41/65) had not recovered within a median follow-up duration of 6.4 months (range: 27 days to 29 months). Monitor patients closely for signs of peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy. Withhold eribulin mesylate in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy, until resolution to Grade 2 or less [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.3 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from an animal reproduction study and its mechanism of action, eribulin mesylate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of eribulin mesylate in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, eribulin mesylate caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with eribulin mesylate and for at least 2 weeks following the final dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with eribulin mesylate and for 3.5 months following the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] 5.4 QT Prolongation In an uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, QT prolongation was observed on Day 8, independent of eribulin concentration, with no QT prolongation observed on Day 1. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating eribulin mesylate and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid eribulin mesylate in patients with congenital long QT syndrome.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) in metastatic breast cancer were neutropenia, anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) in liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma were fatigue, nausea, alopecia, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain, and pyrexia. The most common (\u22655%) Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities in liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma were neutropenia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia.

The following adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling: Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] In clinical trials, eribulin mesylate has been administered to 1963 patients including 467 patients exposed to eribulin mesylate for 6 months or longer. The majority of the 1963 patients were women (92%) with a median age of 55 years (range: 17 to 85 years). The racial and ethnic distribution was White (72%), Black (4%), Asian (9%), and other (3%). Metastatic Breast Cancer The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate were neutropenia, anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation. The most common serious adverse reactions reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate were febrile neutropenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%). The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of eribulin mesylate was peripheral neuropathy (5%). The adverse reactions described in Table 2 were identified in 750 patients treated in Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( . In Study 1, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either eribulin mesylate (1.4 mg/m 14.1 )] 2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or single agent treatment chosen by their physician (control group). A total of 503 patients received eribulin mesylate and 247 patients in the control group received therapy consisting of chemotherapy [total 97% (anthracyclines 10%, capecitabine 18%, gemcitabine 19%, taxanes 15%, vinorelbine 25%, other chemotherapies 10%)] or hormonal therapy (3%). The median duration of exposure was 118 days for patients receiving eribulin mesylate and 63 days for patients receiving control therapy. Table 2 reports the most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients in either group.

Cytopenias : Grade 3 neutropenia occurred in 28% (143/503) of patients who received eribulin mesylate in Study 1, and 29% (144/503) of patients experienced Grade 4 neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% (23/503) of patients; two patients (0.4%) died from complications of febrile neutropenia. Dose reduction due to neutropenia was required in 12% (62/503) of patients and discontinuation was required in <1% of patients. The mean time to nadir was 13 days and the mean time to recovery from severe neutropenia (<500/mm 3 ) was 8 days. Grade 3 or greater thrombocytopenia occurred in 1% (7/503) of patients. G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) or GM-CSF (granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor) was used in 19% of patients who received eribulin mesylate. Peripheral Neuropathy :\u00a0In Study 1, 17% of enrolled patients had Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy and 3% of patients had Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Dose reduction due to peripheral neuropathy was required by 3% (14/503) of patients who received eribulin mesylate. Four percent (20/503) of patients experienced peripheral motor neuropathy of any grade and 2% (8/503) of patients developed Grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy. Liver Function Test Abnormalities : Among patients with Grade 0 or 1 ALT levels at baseline, 18% of eribulin mesylate -treated patients experienced Grade 2 or greater ALT elevation. One eribulin mesylate -treated patient without documented liver metastases had concomitant Grade 2 elevations in bilirubin and ALT; these abnormalities resolved and did not recur with re-exposure to eribulin mesylate. Less Common Adverse Reactions : The following additional adverse reactions were reported in \u22655% to <10% of the eribulin mesylate -treated group: Eye Disorders: increased lacrimation Gastrointestinal Disorders: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, stomatitis, dry mouth General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: peripheral edema Infections and Infestations: upper respiratory tract infection Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hypokalemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: muscle spasms, muscular weakness Nervous System Disorders: dysgeusia, dizziness Psychiatric Disorders: insomnia, depression Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash Liposarcoma The safety of eribulin mesylate was evaluated in Study 2, an open-label, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled trial, in which patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle or dacarbazine at doses of 850 mg/m 2 (20%), 1000 mg/m 2 (64%), or 1200 mg/m 2 (16%) every 3 weeks. A total of 223 patients received eribulin mesylate and 221 patients received dacarbazine. Patients were required to have received at least two prior systemic chemotherapy regimens. The trial excluded patients with pre-existing \u2265 Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, known central nervous system metastasis, elevated serum bilirubin or significant chronic liver disease, history of myocardial infarction within 6 months, history of New York Heart Association Class II or IV heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment. The median age of the safety population in Study 2 was 56 years (range: 24 to 83 years); 67% female; 73% White, 3% Black or African American, 8% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 15% unknown; 99% received prior anthracycline-containing regimen; and 99% received \u2265 2 prior regimens. The median duration of exposure was 2.3 months (range: 21 days to 26 months) for patients receiving eribulin mesylate [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.2 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate were fatigue, nausea, alopecia, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain, and pyrexia. The most common (\u22655%) Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate were neutropenia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. The most common serious adverse reactions reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate were neutropenia (4.9%) and pyrexia (4.5%). Permanent discontinuation of eribulin mesylate for adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of eribulin mesylate were fatigue and thrombocytopenia (0.9% each). Twenty-six percent of patients required at least one dose reduction. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction were neutropenia (18%) and peripheral neuropathy (4.0%).
