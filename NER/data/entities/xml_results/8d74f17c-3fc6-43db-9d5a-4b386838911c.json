    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nplate is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in: Adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. ( 1.1 ) Pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with ITP for at least 6 months\u00a0who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. ( 1.1 ) Nplate is indicated to increase survival in adults and in pediatric patients (including term neonates) acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome [HS-ARS]). ( 1.2 ) Limitations of Use: Nplate is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or any cause of thrombocytopenia other than ITP. Nplate should be used only in patients with ITP whose degree of thrombocytopenia and clinical condition increases the risk for bleeding. Nplate should not be used in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. ( 1 ) 1.1 Patients with Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) Nplate is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in: Adult patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. Pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with ITP for at least 6 months who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. 1.2 Patients with Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome Nplate is indicated to increase survival in adults and in pediatric patients (including term neonates) acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation [see .

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS In some patients with MDS, Nplate increases blast cell counts and increases the risk of progression to acute myelogenous leukemia. ( 5.1 ) Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications have resulted from increases in platelet counts with Nplate use. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease receiving Nplate. ( 5.2 ) Severe thrombocytopenia may persist during Nplate treatment due to neutralizing antibodies or other causes. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Risk of Progression of Myelodysplastic Syndromes to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Progression from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has been observed in adult clinical trials with Nplate. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolling adult patients with severe thrombocytopenia and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low or intermediate-1 risk MDS was terminated due to more cases of AML observed in the Nplate arm. This trial consisted of a 58-week study period with a 5-year long-term follow-up phase. The patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with Nplate or placebo (167 Nplate, 83 placebo). During the 58-week study period, progression to AML occurred in 10 (6.0%) patients in the Nplate arm and 4 (4.8%) patients in the placebo arm (hazard ratio [95%CI] = 1.20 [0.38, 3.84]). Of the 250 patients, 210 (84.0%) entered the long-term follow-up phase of this study. With 5 years of follow-up, 29 (11.6%) patients showed progression to AML, including 20/168 (11.9%) patients in the Nplate arm versus 9/82 (11.0%) patients in the placebo arm (HR [95% CI] = 1.06 [0.48, 2.33]). The incidence of death (overall survival) was 55.7% (93/167) in the Nplate arm versus 54.2% (45/83) in the placebo arm (HR [95% CI] = 1.03 [0.72, 1.47]). In the baseline low IPSS group, there was a higher incidence of death in the Nplate arm [41.3% (19/46)] compared to the placebo arm [30.4% (7/23)] (HR [95% CI] = 1.59 [0.67, 3.80]). In a single-arm trial of Nplate given to 72\u00a0patients with thrombocytopenia-related MDS, 8 (11.1%)\u00a0patients were reported as having possible disease progression, of which 3 (4.2%) had confirmation of AML during follow-up. In addition, in 3 (4.2%) patients, increased peripheral blood blast cell counts decreased to baseline after discontinuation of Nplate. Nplate is not indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia due to MDS or any cause of thrombocytopenia other than ITP. 5.2 Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications Thrombotic/thromboembolic complications have resulted from increases in platelet counts with Nplate use secondary to drug-induced thrombocytosis, regardless of the underlying disease. Thrombotic/ thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis (1.4%), pulmonary embolism (1.2%) and myocardial infarction (0.8%) have been observed with the use of Nplate in the ITP population. Other thrombotic events including transient ischemic attack have been reported. These events have occurred regardless of platelet counts. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with and without chronic liver disease receiving Nplate. In patients with ITP, to minimize the risk for thrombotic/thromboembolic complications, do not use Nplate in an attempt to normalize platelet counts. Follow the dose adjustment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . In the absence of myelosuppression induced by acute exposure to radiation, Nplate administration might cause excessive increases in platelet counts and may cause thrombotic and thromboembolic complications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 5.3 Loss of Response to Nplate Hyporesponsiveness or failure to maintain a platelet response with Nplate may occur due to neutralizing antibodies or other causes [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.3 )] . Discontinue Nplate if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding after 4\u00a0weeks at the highest weekly dose of 10\u00a0mcg/kg.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections: Progression of Myelodysplastic Syndromes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Loss of Response to Nplate [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] In adult patients, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265\u00a05% higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo) are arthralgia, dizziness, insomnia, myalgia, pain in extremity, abdominal pain, shoulder pain, dyspepsia, and paresthesia. Headache was the most commonly reported adverse reaction that did not occur at \u2265\u00a05% higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo. ( 6.1 ) In pediatric patients, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 25%) are: contusion, upper respiratory tract infection, and oropharyngeal pain.

Adults The data described below reflect Nplate exposure to 271 adult\u00a0patients with ITP, aged 18 to 88, of whom 62% were female. Nplate was studied in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind studies that were identical in design, with the exception that Study 1 evaluated non-splenectomized patients with ITP and Study 2 evaluated splenectomized patients with ITP.\u00a0Data are also reported from an open-label, single-arm study in which patients received Nplate over an extended period of time. Overall, Nplate was administered to 114\u00a0patients for at least 52\u00a0weeks and 53\u00a0patients for at least 96\u00a0weeks. In the placebo-controlled studies, headache was the most commonly reported adverse drug reaction, occurring in 35% of patients receiving Nplate and 32% of patients receiving placebo. For those patients receiving Nplate, 14 (48%) of headaches were mild, 9 (31%) were moderate, and 6 (21%) were severe. Table 3 presents adverse drug reactions from Studies 1 and 2 with a \u2265\u00a05% higher patient incidence in Nplate versus placebo. Table 3. Adverse Reactions Identified in\u00a0Two Placebo-Controlled Studies Adverse Reactions by Body System Nplate (%) (n = 84) Placebo (%) (n = 41) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 22 (26%) 8 (20%) Myalgia 12 (14%) 1 (2%) Pain in Extremity 11 (13%) 2 (5%) Shoulder Pain 7 (8%) 0 Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 14 (17%) 0 Paresthesia 5 (6%) 0 Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 13 (16%) 3 (7%) Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain 9 (11%) 0 Dyspepsia 6 (7%) 0 MedDRA version 9 is used. Among 291\u00a0adult\u00a0patients with ITP who received Nplate in the single-arm extension study, the incidence rates of the adverse reactions occurred in a pattern similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical studies. The safety profile of Nplate was similar across patients, regardless of ITP duration. The following adverse reactions (at least 5% incidence and at least 5% more frequent with Nplate compared with placebo or standard of care) occurred in Nplate patients with ITP duration up to 12 months: bronchitis, sinusitis, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, nausea and oropharyngeal pain.  The adverse reaction of thrombocytosis occurred with an incidence of 2% in adults with ITP duration up to 12 months. Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Collagen Fibrosis Nplate administration may increase the risk for development or progression of reticulin fiber formation within the bone marrow. This formation may improve upon discontinuation of Nplate. In a clinical trial, one patient with ITP and hemolytic anemia developed marrow fibrosis with collagen during Nplate therapy.  An open-label clinical trial prospectively evaluated changes in bone marrow reticulin formation and collagen fibrosis in adult patients with ITP treated with Nplate or a non-US approved romiplostim product.\u00a0Patients were administered romiplostim by SC injection once weekly for up to 3\u00a0years.\u00a0Based on cohort assignment at time of study enrollment, patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin and collagen at year\u00a01 (cohort\u00a01), year\u00a02 (cohort\u00a02), or year\u00a03 (cohort\u00a03) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at start of the trial.\u00a0Patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin formation and collagen fibrosis using the modified Bauermeister grading scale.\u00a0From the total of 169\u00a0patients enrolled in the 3 cohorts, 132\u00a0(78%)\u00a0patients were evaluable for bone marrow collagen fibrosis and 131\u00a0(78%)\u00a0patients were evaluable for bone marrow reticulin formation. Two percent (2/132) of patients (both from cohort 3) developed Grade 4\u00a0findings (presence of collagen).\u00a0There was no detectable bone marrow collagen in one patient on repeat testing 12\u00a0weeks after discontinuation of romiplostim.\u00a0Progression of bone marrow reticulin formation (increase greater than or equal to 2 grades or more) or an increase to Grade 4 (presence of collagen) was reported in 7%\u00a0(9/131) of patients. Pediatric Patients The data described below reflect median exposure to Nplate of 168 days for 59 pediatric patients (aged 1 to 17 years) with ITP for at least 6 months, of whom 47.5% were female, across the randomized phase of two placebo-controlled trials. Table 4 presents the most common adverse reactions experienced by at least 5% of the pediatric patients (1 year and older) receiving Nplate across the two placebo-controlled trials with at least a 5% higher incidence in patients who received Nplate compared to those who received placebo. Table 4. Common Adverse Reactions (\u2265 5% Incidence and \u2265 5% More Frequent on the Nplate Arm) from Two Placebo-Controlled Trials in Pediatric Patients with ITP for at least 6 months MedDRA version 20.1 is used. In pediatric patients of age \u2265 1 year receiving Nplate for ITP, adverse reactions with an incidence of \u2265 25% in the two randomized trials were: contusion (41%), upper respiratory tract infection (31%), and oropharyngeal pain (25%). Adverse Reactions by Body System Nplate (%) (N = 59) Placebo (%) (N = 24) Infections and Infestations Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 18 (31%) 6 (25%) Ear Infection 3 (5%) 0 Gastroenteritis 3 (5%) 0 Sinusitis 3 (5%) 0 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Oropharyngeal Pain 15 (25%) 1 (4%) Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhea 12 (20%) 3 (13%) Abdominal Pain Upper 8 (14%) 1 (4%) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 9 (15%) 2 (8%) Purpura 4 (7%) 0 Urticaria 3 (5%) 0 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Pyrexia 14 (24%) 2 (8%) Peripheral Swelling 4 (7%) 0 Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications Contusion 24 (41%) 8 (33%) Among 203 pediatric patients with ITP who received Nplate in a single arm, open-label, long-term (median duration of 3 years on therapy) study, the incidence rates of the adverse reactions occurred in a pattern similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical studies. In this single arm, open-label, long-term study, headache occurred in 78 patients (38%), 3% (n=6) being severe and 1% (n=2) resulting in discontinuation of drug. Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Collagen Fibrosis The open-label long-term study also evaluated changes in bone marrow reticulin and collagen formation. The modified Bauermeister grading scale was used for both assessments. Based on cohort assignment at the time of study enrollment, patients were evaluated for bone marrow reticulin and collagen at year 1 (cohort 1) or year 2 (cohort 2) in comparison to the baseline bone marrow at the start of the study. From the total of 79 patients enrolled in the 2 cohorts, 27 (90%) patients in cohort 1 and 36 (73.5%) patients in cohort 2 had evaluable on-study bone marrow biopsies. Increased reticulin fiber formation was reported for 18.5% (5 of 27) of patients in cohort 1 and 47.2% (17 of 36) of patients in cohort 2, with a maximum grade of 2. No patients in either cohort developed collagen fibrosis (defined as grade 4) or a bone marrow abnormality that was inconsistent with an underlying diagnosis of ITP. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Nplate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Erythromelalgia Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis 6.3 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Nplate in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. Patients were screened for immunogenicity to romiplostim using a BIAcore-based biosensor immunoassay. This assay is capable of detecting both high- and low-affinity binding antibodies that bind to romiplostim and cross-react with TPO. The samples from patients that tested positive for binding antibodies were further evaluated for neutralizing capacity using a cell-based bioassay. In adult clinical studies in adult patients with ITP, the incidence of pre-existing antibodies to romiplostim was 3.3%\u00a0(35/1046) and the incidence of binding antibody development during treatment with Nplate or a non-US approved romiplostim product was 5.7%\u00a0(60/1046). The incidence of pre-existing antibodies to endogenous TPO was 3%\u00a0(31/1046) and the incidence of binding antibody development to endogenous TPO during treatment\u00a0was 3.2%\u00a0(33/1046). Of the patients with positive binding antibodies that developed to romiplostim or to TPO, four patients had neutralizing activity to romiplostim and none had neutralizing activity to TPO. No apparent correlation was observed between antibody activity and clinical effectiveness or safety. In pediatric studies, data on antibody formation was collected from 282 patients (20 from early phase studies, 59 from phase 3 studies with duration of 6 months and 203 from a long-term study with median duration of 3 years). The incidence of binding antibodies to Nplate at any time was 9.6% (27/282), of which 2 patients (0.7%) had pre-existing binding non-neutralizing Nplate antibodies at baseline and 11 patients (3.9%) had persistent binding antibody positivity at end of study. Additionally, 2.8% (8/282) developed neutralizing antibodies to Nplate, with 4 patients (1.4%) having persistent neutralizing antibody positivity at end of study, despite discontinuation of Nplate. The incidence of binding antibodies to TPO at any time was 3.9% (11/282), of which 2 patients (0.7%) had pre-existing binding non-neutralizing antibodies to TPO at baseline and 1 patient (0.4%) had binding persistent antibody positivity at end of study. One patient (0.4%) had a weakly positive postbaseline result for neutralizing antibodies against TPO while on study (with positive non-neutralizing antibodies to Nplate) with a negative result at baseline for both antibodies. The patient showed a transient antibody response for neutralizing antibodies against TPO, with a negative result at the patient's last timepoint tested within the study period after discontinuation of Nplate. A postmarketing registry study involving patients with thrombocytopenia on Nplate or a non-US approved romiplostim\u00a0product was conducted to assess the long-term consequences of the anti-romiplostim antibodies.\u00a0Adult patients who lacked response or lost response to Nplate or a non-US approved romiplostim\u00a0product were enrolled. The incidence of new binding antibody development was 3.8%\u00a0(7/184) to romiplostim and 2.2%\u00a0(4/184) were positive for binding, non-neutralizing antibodies to TPO; two patients\u00a0were positive for binding antibodies to both romiplostim and TPO. Of the seven patients with positive binding antibodies to romiplostim, one patient (0.5%; 1/184) was positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim only. Nineteen confirmed pediatric patients were included in the postmarketing registry study. The incidence of binding antibody post treatment was 16% (3/19) to romiplostim, of which 5.3% (1/19) were positive for neutralizing\u00a0antibodies to romiplostim. There were no antibodies detected to TPO. Immunogenicity assay results are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay used in detection and may be influenced by several factors, including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to romiplostim with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.",
