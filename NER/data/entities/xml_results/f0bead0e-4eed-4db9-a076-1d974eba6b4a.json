    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Monitoring of PNH Manifestations After FABHALTA Discontinuation: Monitor for signs of hemolysis after discontinuation. ( 5.3 ) Hyperlipidemia: Monitor serum lipid parameters periodically during treatment and initiate cholesterol-lowering medication, if indicated. ( 5.4 ) 5.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Serious Infections Caused by Encapsulated Bacteria FABHALTA, a complement inhibitor, increases a patient\u2019s susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis (caused by any serogroup, including non-groupable strains), and Haemophilus influenzae type b. Life-threatening and fatal infections with encapsulated bacteria have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of FABHALTA treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria. Complete or update vaccination against encapsulated bacteria at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of FABHALTA, according to the current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of therapy with FABHALTA. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent FABHALTA therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with vaccines against encapsulated bacteria according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer these vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including FABHALTA. The benefits and risks of treatment with FABHALTA, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria. Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious encapsulated bacterial infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of serious infection and evaluate patients immediately if an infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Serious infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of FABHALTA in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious infections, depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated. FABHALTA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . 5.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FABHALTA REMS FABHALTA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called FABHALTA REMS, because of the risk of serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Notable requirements of the FABHALTA REMS include the following: Prescribers must enroll in the REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria. Prescribers must provide patients with the REMS educational materials. Prescribers must assess patient vaccination status for vaccines against encapsulated bacteria and vaccinate if needed according to current ACIP recommendations two weeks prior to the first dose of FABHALTA. Prescribers must provide a prescription for antibacterial drug prophylaxis if treatment must be started urgently, and the patient is not up to date with vaccines against encapsulated bacteria according to current ACIP recommendations at least two weeks prior to the first dose of FABHALTA. Pharmacies that dispense FABHALTA must be certified in the FABHALTA REMS and must verify prescribers are certified. Patients must receive counseling from the prescriber about the need to receive vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria per ACIP recommendations, the need to take antibiotics as directed by the prescriber, and the early signs and symptoms of serious infections. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during treatment and for 2 weeks following the last dose of FABHALTA. Further information is available by telephone: 1-833-99FABHA (1-833-993-2242) or online at www.FABHALTA-REMS.com. 5.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Monitoring of PNH Manifestations After FABHALTA Discontinuation In PNH patients, after discontinuing treatment with FABHALTA, closely monitor patients for at least 2 weeks after the last dose for signs and symptoms of hemolysis. These signs include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels along with a sudden decrease in hemoglobin or PNH clone size, fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, dyspnea, major adverse vascular events (such as thrombosis, stroke and myocardial infarction), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. If discontinuation of FABHALTA is necessary, consider alternative therapy. If hemolysis occurs after discontinuation of FABHALTA, consider restarting treatment with FABHALTA, if appropriate, or initiating another treatment for PNH. 5.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hyperlipidemia FABHALTA may increase total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and serum triglycerides [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Of the 54 FABHALTA-treated patients who had a normal total cholesterol level at baseline in APPLY-PNH, 43% developed Grade 1 hypercholesterolemia during the randomized treatment period. One FABHALTA-treated patient in APPLY-PNH experienced increased total cholesterol that worsened to Grade 2 from Grade 1 at baseline. Of the 34 FABHALTA-treated patients who had a normal cholesterol level at baseline in APPOINT-PNH, 24% developed Grade 1 hypercholesterolemia during the core treatment period. Of the 60 FABHALTA-treated patients who had LDL-cholesterol \u2264 130 mg/dL at baseline in APPLY-PNH, 17% developed LDL-cholesterol > 130-160 mg/dL, 8% developed LDL-cholesterol > 160-190 mg/dL, and 7% developed LDL-cholesterol > 190 mg/dL during the randomized treatment period. Of the 36 FABHALTA-treated patients who had LDL-cholesterol \u2264 130 mg/dL at baseline in APPOINT-PNH, 11% developed LDL-cholesterol > 130-160 mg/dL and 3% developed LDL-cholesterol > 160-190 mg/dL. Of the 52 patients with normal triglyceride levels at baseline in APPLY-PNH, 23% developed Grade 1 elevated triglycerides during the randomized treatment period. Three FABHALTA-treated patients in APPLY-PNH experienced an increase in triglycerides from Grade 1 to Grade 2. Of the 37 FABHALTA-treated patients who had a normal triglyceride level at baseline in APPOINT-PNH, 27% developed Grade 1 elevated triglycerides in the core treatment period. Of the 102 FABHALTA-treated patients in APPLY-PNH and APPOINT-PNH, two patients required cholesterol-lowering medications. Monitor serum lipid parameters periodically during treatment with FABHALTA and initiate cholesterol-lowering medication, if indicated.",

Description of Select Adverse Reactions (graded per NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 unless noted otherwise) Platelet Count Decreased Of the 37 FABHALTA-treated patients who had normal platelet counts at baseline in APPLY-PNH, 43% experienced any Grade thrombocytopenia during the randomized treatment period. Three FABHALTA-treated patients in APPLY-PNH experienced decreased platelets that worsened to Grade \u2265 3 from baseline (one patient with normal platelets that worsened to Grade 4, one patient with baseline Grade 1 that worsened to Grade 4, and one patient with baseline Grade 3 that worsened to Grade 4). Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy (IgAN) The safety of FABHALTA was evaluated in APPLAUSE-IgAN, a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study in adults with IgAN (eGFR \u2265 20 mL /min/1.73 m 2 at baseline). The data below reflect FABHALTA exposure in 235 patients with IgAN (eGFR \u2265 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline) with a median duration of 43 weeks (up to 104 weeks) in APPLAUSE-IgAN. Table 2 describes the adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 3 % of patients treated with FABHALTA and were \u2265 2% higher in frequency than placebo. All of these adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Table 2: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 3% of Adult Patients with IgAN (eGFR \u2265 20 mL /min/1.73 m 2 ) Treated with FABHALTA and \u2265 2% Higher in Frequency Than Placebo in APPLAUSE-IgAN 1 Includes similar terms.

No new adverse reactions were identified during the 6-month placebo-controlled period of APPEAR-C3G, in which 38 patients were treated with FABHALTA and 36 patients were treated with placebo. The most common adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 10% of patients treated with FABHALTA and were \u2265 5% higher in frequency than placebo were nasopharyngitis (11% in FABHALTA, 3% placebo) and viral infections (29% in FABHALTA, 22% placebo), mainly respiratory infections. One patient (3%) on FABHALTA and none on placebo had a serious adverse reaction of pneumonia and bacteremia secondary to an encapsulated organism ( S. pneumoniae ).",
