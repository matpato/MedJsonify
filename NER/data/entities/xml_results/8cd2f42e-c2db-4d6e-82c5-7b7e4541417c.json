    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS WARNING: PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR FATAL RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION. POSTMARKETING CASES OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, INCLUDING FATALITIES, HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH USE OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE. A WIDE RANGE OF WEIGHT-BASED DOSES OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE HAVE RESULTED IN RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN THESE PATIENTS. CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ADMINISTERING PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE TO PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE OF PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE BE USED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER AND CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER DRUGS WITH RESPIRATORY DEPRESSANT EFFECTS BE AVOIDED. Promethazine: CNS Depression \u2013 Promethazine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. The impairment may be amplified by concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics ( including barbiturates ) , narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should either be eliminated or given in reduced dosage in the presence of promethazine HCl ( see and PRECAUTIONS - Information For Patients ) . Drug Interactions Respiratory Depression \u2013 Promethazine may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression. Use of promethazine in patients with compromised respiratory function ( e.g. , COPD, sleep apnea ) should be avoided. Lower Seizure Threshold \u2013 Promethazine may lower seizure threshold. It should be used with caution in persons with seizure disorders or in persons who are using concomitant medications, such as narcotics or local anesthetics, which may also affect seizure threshold. Bone Marrow Depression \u2013 Promethazine should be used with caution in patients with bone marrow depression. Leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported, usually when promethazine HCl has been used in association with other known marrow toxic agents. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome \u2013 A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) has been reported in association with promethazine HCl alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias ) . The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness ( e.g. , pneumonia, systemic infection, etc. ) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms ( EPS ) . Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system ( CNS ) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1 ) immediate discontinuation of promethazine HCl, antipsychotic drugs, if any, and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2 ) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3 ) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. Since recurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines, the reintroduction of promethazine HCl should be carefully considered.PRECAUTIONS Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the drug combination\u2014promethazine and phenylephrine. It is not known whether this drug combination can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Promethazine and phenylephrine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. General: Drugs having anticholinergic properties should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, and bladder-neck obstruction. Promethazine should be used cautiously in persons with cardiovascular disease or impairment of liver function. Phenylephrine should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly hypertension. Information For Patients: Promethazine and phenylephrine may cause marked drowsiness or may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery. Ambulatory patients should be told to avoid engaging in such activities until it is known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from promethazine and phenylephrine therapy. Children should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities. The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants, including narcotic analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, and tranquilizers, may have an additive effect and should be avoided or their dosage reduced. Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements. Avoid prolonged exposure to the sun. Drug Interactions: Promethazine CNS Depressants \u2013 Promethazine may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics ( including barbiturates ) , narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine HCl. When given concomitantly with promethazine, the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine HCl relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain. Epinephrine \u2013 Because of the potential for promethazine to reverse epinephrine's vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine overdose. Anticholinergics \u2013 Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOI ) \u2013 Drug interactions, including an increased incidence of extrapyramidal effects, have been reported when some MAOI and phenothiazines are used concomitantly. Phenylephrine Drug Phenylephrine with prior administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) . Effect Cardiac pressor response potentiated. May cause acute hypertensive crisis. Drug Phenylephrine with tricyclic antidepressants. Effect Pressor response increased. Drug Phenylephrine with ergot alkaloids. Effect Excessive rise in blood pressure. Drug Phenylephrine with bronchodilator sympathomimetic agents and with epinephrine or other sympathomimetics. Effect Tachycardia or other arrhythmias may occur. Drug Phenylephrine with atropine sulfate. Effect Reflex bradycardia blocked; pressor response enhanced. Drug Phenylephrine with prior administration of propranolol or other \u03b2-adrenergic blockers. Effect Cardiostimulating effects blocked. Drug Phenylephrine with prior administration of phentolamine or other \u03b1-adrenergic blockers. Effect Pressor response decreased. Drug Phenylephrine with diet preparations, such as amphetamines or phenylpropanolamine. Effect Synergistic adrenergic response. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving therapy with promethazine hydrochloride. Pregnancy Tests: Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between HCG and anti-HCG may result in false-negative or false-positive interpretations. Glucose Tolerance Test: An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving promethazine. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility: Promethazine: Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of promethazine, nor are there other animal or human data concerning carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility with this drug. Promethazine was nonmutagenic in the Salmonella test system of Ames. Phenylephrine: A study which followed the development of cancer in 143.574 patients over a four-year period indicated that in 11.981 patients who received phenylephrine ( systemic or topical ) , there was no statistically significant association between the drug and cancer at any or all sites. Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of phenylephrine, nor are there other animal or human data concerning mutagenicity. A study of the effects of adrenergic drugs on ovum transport in rabbits indicated that treatment with phenylephrine did not alter incidence of pregnancy; the number of implantations was significantly reduced when high doses of the drug were used. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects \u2013 Pregnancy Category C. Promethazine: Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat-feeding studies at doses of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg of promethazine HCl. These doses are from approximately 2.1 to 4.2 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine for a 50-kg subject, depending upon the indication for which the drug is prescribed. Daily doses of 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally have been found to produce fetal mortality in rats. Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition, lactation, and development of the animal neonate were not done, but a general preliminary study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters. Although antihistamines have been found to produce fetal mortality in rodents, the pharmacological effects of histamine in the rodent do not parallel those in man. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of promethazine in pregnant women. Phenylephrine: A study in rabbits indicated that continued moderate overexposure to phenylephrine ( 3 mg/day ) during the second half of pregnancy ( 22 nd day of gestation to delivery ) may contribute to perinatal wastage, prematurity, premature labor, and possibly fetal anomalies; when phenylephrine ( 3 mg/day ) was given to rabbits during the first half of pregnancy ( 3 rd day after mating for seven days ) , a significant number gave birth to litters of low birth weight. Another study showed that phenylephrine was associated with anomalies of aortic arch and with ventricular septal defect in the chick embryo. Promethazine and phenylephrine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects - Promethazine administered to a pregnant woman within two weeks of delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn. Labor And Delivery: Administration of phenylephrine to patients in late pregnancy or labor may cause fetal anoxia or bradycardia by increasing contractility of the uterus and decreasing uterine blood flow. See also \" Nonteratogenic Effects. \" Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether promethazine or phenylephrine are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when promethazine and phenylephrine is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE AND PHENYLEPHRINE HYDROCHLORIDE ORAL SOLUTION IS CONTRAINDICATED FOR USE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OF AGE ( see and WARNINGS \u2013 Black Box Warning ) . Use In Pediatric Patients Promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride oral solution should be used with caution in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older ( see ) . WARNINGS \u2013 Use In Pediatric Patients Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride oral solution did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride syrup and observed closely.",
