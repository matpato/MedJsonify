    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Heart Failure: Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Vitamin B Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 Deficiency: 12 levels. Measure hematological parameters annually. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Consider a lower dosage of insulin or insulin secretagogue when used in combination with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity-Related Events: There have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions in patients treated with saxagliptin. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, treat promptly, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets ( 5.8 ). 5.1\tLactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablet-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The post-marketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [ see ]: Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) \u2022 Before initiating saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). \u2022 Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 [ see ]. Contraindications (4) \u2022 Initiation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . \u2022 Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. \u2022 In patients taking saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug Interactions: The concomitant use of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [ see ]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Drug Interactions (7) Age 65 or Greater: The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see ]. Use in Specific Populations (8.5) Radiological Studies with Contrast: Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures: Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States: Several of the post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Excessive Alcohol Intake: Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2\tPancreatitis There have been post-marketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking saxagliptin. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), cases of definite acute pancreatitis were confirmed in 17 of 8240 (0.2%) patients receiving saxagliptin compared to 9 of 8173 (0.1%) receiving placebo. Pre-existing risk factors for pancreatitis were identified in 88% (15/17) of those patients receiving saxagliptin and in 100% (9/9) of those patients receiving placebo. After initiation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, observe patients for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and initiate appropriate management. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.3\tHeart Failure In a cardiovascular outcomes trial enrolling participants with established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (SAVOR trial), more patients randomized to saxagliptin (289/8280, 3.5%) were hospitalized for heart failure compared to patients randomized to placebo (228/8212, 2.8%). In a time-to-first-event analysis the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was higher in the saxagliptin group (estimated Hazard Ratio: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.51). Patients with a prior history of heart failure and patients with renal impairment had a higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure, irrespective of treatment assignment. Consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets prior to initiating treatment in patients at a higher risk for heart failure. Observe patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure, and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.4\tVitamin B 12 Concentrations In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [ see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) 5.5\tHypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Saxagliptin When saxagliptin was used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [ see ]. Therefore, a lower dosage of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Adverse Reactions (6.1) Metformin HCl Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when strenuous exercise is not compensated by caloric supplementation, or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents (such as sulfonylureas and insulin) or ethanol. Elderly, debilitated, or malnourished patients and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or alcohol intoxication are particularly susceptible to hypoglycemic effects. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.6\tHypersensitivity Reactions There have been post-marketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with saxagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with saxagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.2) Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. 5.7\tSevere and Disabling Arthralgia There have been post-marketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP4 inhibitor. Consider DPP4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.8\tBullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin HCl In placebo-controlled monotherapy trials of metformin HCl extended-release, diarrhea and nausea/vomiting were reported in > 5% of metformin-treated patients and more commonly than in placebo-treated patients (9.6% versus 2.6% for diarrhea and 6.5% versus 1.5% for nausea/vomiting). Diarrhea led to discontinuation of trial medication in 0.6% of the patients treated with metformin HCl extended-release. Saxagliptin The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of 5 placebo-controlled clinical trials [ see ]. These data shown in the table reflect exposure of 882 patients to saxagliptin and a mean duration of exposure to saxagliptin of 21 weeks. The mean age of these patients was 55 years, 1.4% were 75 years or older and 48.4% were male. The population was 67.5% White, 4.6% Black or African American, 17.4% Asian, 10.5% other races and 9.8% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 5.2 years and a mean HbA1c of 8.2%. Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired (eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m Clinical Studies (14) 2 ) in 91% of these patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, associated with the use of saxagliptin. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly on saxagliptin than on placebo and occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with saxagliptin. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials The 5 placebo-controlled trials include two monotherapy trials and one add-on combination therapy trial with each of the following: metformin HCl, thiazolidinedione, or glyburide. Table shows 24-week data regardless of glycemic rescue. Reported in \u2265 5% of Patients Treated with Saxagliptin 5 mg and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Placebo % of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg N = 882 Placebo N = 799 Upper respiratory tract infection 7.7 7.6 Urinary tract infection 6.8 6.1 Headache 6.5 5.9 In patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, headache (6.5%) was the only adverse reaction reported at a rate \u2265 5% and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to TZD trial, the incidence of peripheral edema was higher for saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo (8.1% and 4.3%, respectively). The incidence of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg was 3.1%. None of the reported adverse reactions of peripheral edema resulted in trial drug discontinuation. Rates of peripheral edema for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo were 3.6% and 2% versus 3% given as monotherapy, 2.1% and 2.1% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to metformin HCl, and 2.4% and 1.2% versus 2.2% given as add-on therapy to glyburide. The incidence rate of fractures was 1.0 and 0.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively, for saxagliptin (pooled analysis of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) and placebo. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. The incidence rate of fracture events in patients who received saxagliptin did not increase over time. Causality has not been established and nonclinical studies have not demonstrated adverse effects of saxagliptin on bone. An event of thrombocytopenia, consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, was observed in the clinical program. The relationship of this event to saxagliptin is not known. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.2%, 3.3%, and 1.8% of patients receiving saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 2.5 mg or at least 2 patients treated with saxagliptin 5 mg) associated with premature discontinuation of therapy included lymphopenia (0.1% and 0.5% versus 0%, respectively), rash (0.2% and 0.3% versus 0.3%), blood creatinine increased (0.3% and 0% versus 0%), and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.1% and 0.2% versus 0%). Adverse Reactions with Concomitant Use with Insulin In the add-on to insulin trial [ see ], the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events, was similar between saxagliptin and placebo, except for confirmed hypoglycemia [ Clinical Studies (14.1) see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) Adverse Reactions Associated with Saxagliptin Coadministered with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Table 2 shows the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u2265 5% of patients participating in an additional 24-week, active-controlled trial of coadministered saxagliptin and metformin HCl in treatment-naive patients. Table 2: Coadministration of Saxagliptin and Metformin HCl Immediate-Release in Treatment-Naive Patients: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 5% of Patients Treated with Combination Therapy of Saxagliptin 5 mg Plus Metformin HCl Immediate-Release (and More Commonly than in Patients Treated with Metformin HCl Immediate-Release Alone) Number (%) of Patients Saxagliptin 5 mg + Metformin HCl Metformin HCl immediate-release was initiated at a starting dose of 500 mg daily and titrated up to a maximum of 2,000 mg daily. N = 320 Placebo + Metformin HCl N = 328 Headache 24 (7.5) 17 (5.2) Nasopharyngitis 22 (6.9) 13 (4.0) In patients treated with the combination of saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release, either as saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release therapy or as coadministration in treatment-naive patients, diarrhea was the only gastrointestinal-related event that occurred with an incidence \u2265 5% in any treatment group in both trials. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of diarrhea was 9.9%, 5.8%, and 11.2% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of diarrhea was 6.9% in the saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release group and 7.3% in the placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release group. Hypoglycemia In the saxagliptin clinical trials, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of hypoglycemia. A concurrent glucose measurement was not required or was normal in some patients. Therefore, it is not possible to conclusively determine that all these reports reflect true hypoglycemia. The incidence of reported hypoglycemia for saxagliptin 2.5 mg and saxagliptin 5 mg versus placebo given as monotherapy was 4% and 5.6% versus 4.1%, respectively. In the add-on to metformin HCl immediate-release trial, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7.8% with saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5.8% with saxagliptin 5 mg, and 5% with placebo. When saxagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release were coadministered in treatment-naive patients, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3.4% in patients given saxagliptin 5 mg + metformin HCl immediate-release and 4% in patients given placebo + metformin HCl immediate-release. In the active-controlled trial comparing add-on therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg to glipizide in patients inadequately controlled on metformin HCl alone, the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3% (19 events in 13 patients) with saxagliptin 5 mg versus 36.3% (750 events in 156 patients) with glipizide. Confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL) was reported in none of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in 35 glipizide-treated patients (8.1%) (p < 0.0001). In the saxagliptin add-on to insulin trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 18.4% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 19.9% for placebo. However, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia (accompanying fingerstick blood glucose \u2264 50 mg/dL) was higher with saxagliptin 5 mg (5.3%) versus placebo (3.3%). Among the patients using insulin in combination with metformin HCl, the incidence of confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia was 4.8% with saxagliptin versus 1.9% with placebo. In the saxagliptin add-on to metformin HCl plus sulfonylurea trial, the overall incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 10.1% for saxagliptin 5 mg and 6.3% for placebo. Confirmed hypoglycemia was reported in 1.6% of the saxagliptin-treated patients and in none of the placebo-treated patients [ see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.5) Hypersensitivity Reactions Saxagliptin Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria and facial edema in the 5-trial pooled analysis up to Week 24 were reported in 1.5%, 1.5%, and 0.4% of patients who received saxagliptin 2.5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, and placebo, respectively. None of these events in patients who received saxagliptin required hospitalization or were reported as life-threatening by the investigators. One saxagliptin-treated patient in this pooled analysis discontinued due to generalized urticaria and facial edema. Renal Impairment In the SAVOR trial, adverse reactions related to renal impairment, including laboratory changes (i.e., doubling of serum creatinine compared with baseline and serum creatinine > 6 mg/dL), were reported in 5.8% (483/8280) of saxagliptin-treated patients and 5.1% (422/8212) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (2.1% vs. 1.9%), acute renal failure (1.4% vs. 1.2%), and renal failure (0.8% vs. 0.9%), in the saxagliptin versus placebo groups, respectively. From baseline to the end of treatment, there was a mean decrease in eGFR of 2.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for saxagliptin-treated patients and a mean decrease of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for placebo-treated patients. More patients randomized to saxagliptin (421/5227, 8.1%) compared to patients randomized to placebo (344/5073, 6.8%) had downward shifts in eGFR from > 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., normal or mild renal impairment) to \u2264 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e., moderate or severe renal impairment). The proportions of patients with renal adverse reactions increased with worsening baseline renal function and increased age, regardless of treatment assignment. Infections Saxagliptin In the unblinded, controlled, clinical trial database for saxagliptin to date, there have been 6 (0.12%) reports of tuberculosis among the 4959 saxagliptin-treated patients (1.1 per 1000 patient-years) compared to no reports of tuberculosis among the 2868 comparator-treated patients. Two of these six cases were confirmed with laboratory testing. The remaining cases had limited information or had presumptive diagnoses of tuberculosis. None of the six cases occurred in the United States or in Western Europe. One case occurred in Canada in a patient originally from Indonesia who had recently visited Indonesia. The duration of treatment with saxagliptin until report of tuberculosis ranged from 144 to 929 days. Post-treatment lymphocyte counts were consistently within the reference range for four cases. One patient had lymphopenia prior to initiation of saxagliptin that remained stable throughout saxagliptin treatment. The final patient had an isolated lymphocyte count below normal approximately four months prior to the report of tuberculosis. There have been no spontaneous reports of tuberculosis associated with saxagliptin use. Causality has not been established and there are too few cases to date to determine whether tuberculosis is related to saxagliptin use. There has been one case of a potential opportunistic infection in the unblinded, controlled clinical trial database to date in a saxagliptin-treated patient who developed suspected foodborne fatal salmonella sepsis after approximately 600 days of saxagliptin therapy. There have been no spontaneous reports of opportunistic infections associated with saxagliptin use. Vital Signs Saxagliptin No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs have been observed in patients treated with saxagliptin alone or in combination with metformin HCl. Laboratory Tests Absolute Lymphocyte Counts Saxagliptin There was a dose-related mean decrease in absolute lymphocyte count observed with saxagliptin. From a baseline mean absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 2200 cells/microL, mean decreases of approximately 100 and 120 cells/microL with saxagliptin 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, relative to placebo were observed at 24 weeks in a pooled analysis of five placebo-controlled clinical trials. Similar effects were observed when saxagliptin 5 mg and metformin HCl were coadministered in treatment-naive patients compared to placebo and metformin HCl. There was no difference observed for saxagliptin 2.5 mg relative to placebo. The proportion of patients who were reported to have a lymphocyte count \u2264 750 cells/microL was 0.5%, 1.5%, 1.4%, and 0.4% in the saxagliptin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. In most patients, recurrence was not observed with repeated exposure to saxagliptin although some patients had recurrent decreases upon rechallenge that led to discontinuation of saxagliptin. The decreases in lymphocyte count were not associated with clinically relevant adverse reactions. The 10 mg saxagliptin dosage is not an approved dosage. In the SAVOR trial mean decreases of approximately 84 cells/microL with saxagliptin relative to placebo was observed. The proportion of patients who experienced a decrease in lymphocyte counts to a count of \u2264 750 cells/microL was 1.6% (136/8280) and 1.0% (78/8212) on saxagliptin and placebo, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease in lymphocyte count relative to placebo is not known. When clinically indicated, such as in settings of unusual or prolonged infection, lymphocyte count should be measured. The effect of saxagliptin on lymphocyte counts in patients with lymphocyte abnormalities (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) is unknown. Vitamin B 12 Concentrations Metformin HCl In metformin clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of saxagliptin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, saxagliptin, or metformin HCl. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
