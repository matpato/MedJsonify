    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis: Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis, as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels and discontinue BRENZAVVY if ketoacidosis is suspected. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting. ( 5.1 ) Lower limb amputation: Consider factors that may increase the risk for amputations before initiating BRENZAVVY. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection, or ulcers of the lower limbs, and discontinue if these occur ( 5.2 ) . Volume depletion: May result in acute kidney injury. Before initiating BRENZAVVY, assess and correct volume status in patients with impaired renal function or low systolic blood pressure, elderly patients or patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy ( 5.3 ) Urosepsis and pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated. ( 5.4 ) Hypoglycemia: Consider a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue to reduce risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with BRENZAVVY ( 5.5 ) Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene): Serious, life-threatening cases have occurred in both females and males treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Assess patients presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise. If suspected, institute prompt treatment ( 5.6 ). Genital mycotic infection: Monitor and treat as appropriate. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, BRENZAVVY significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. BRENZAVVY is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors. Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse. Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing BRENZAVVY [see Clinical Pharmacology ( ; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors. 12.2 )] Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue BRENZAVVY, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting BRENZAVVY. Withhold BRENZAVVY, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume BRENZAVVY when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 )] Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue BRENZAVVY and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur. 5.2 Lower Limb Amputation An increased incidence of lower limb amputations occurred in BRENZAVVY-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients (8.3 versus 5.1 events per 1,000 patient-years) in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or were at risk for CVD (Trial 6). Additional amputation data from Trial 6 are shown in Table 2 [see Adverse Reactions ( Of the 23 BRENZAVVY-treated patients who had amputations, 15 were amputations of the toe and midfoot and 8 were amputations above and below the knee. Some patients had multiple amputations. 6.1 )]. Lower limb infections, gangrene, ischemia, and osteomyelitis were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. The risk of amputation was highest in patients with a baseline history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy. Before initiating BRENZAVVY, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to the need for amputations, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving BRENZAVVY for signs and symptoms of infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue BRENZAVVY if these complications occur. 5.3 Volume Depletion BRENZAVVY can cause intravascular volume contraction which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions ( . There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 6.1 )] 2 ) [see Use in Specific Populations ( , elderly patients, patients with low systolic blood pressure, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating BRENZAVVY in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function 8.6 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating BRENZAVVY. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, and renal function after initiating therapy. 2.1 )] 5.4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been reports of serious urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including BRENZAVVY. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors, including BRENZAVVY, increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) are known to cause hypoglycemia. BRENZAVVY may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions ( . A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with BRENZAVVY. 6.1 )] 5.6 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene) Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Cases have been reported in both females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with BRENZAVVY presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal areas, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue BRENZAVVY, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control. 5.7 Genital Mycotic Infections BRENZAVVY increases the risk of genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions ( . Patients who have a history of genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop genital mycotic infections. Monitor and treat appropriately. 6.1 )]",

Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials Evaluating BRENZAVVY 20 mg The data in Table 1 are derived from three trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: two 24-week placebo-controlled trials (one as monotherapy and another as add-on to metformin therapy; Trials 1 and 2, respectively) [see Clinical Studies ( and a 12-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, monotherapy trial (only the data from the 20 mg dosage of BRENZAVVY per day were included in this pool). In these pooled trials, patients received placebo (N = 300) or BRENZAVVY 20 mg (N = 372), once daily. The mean age of the population was 56 years and 5% of the patients were older than 75 years of age. Fifty-seven percent (57%) were male and 45% were White, 38% Asian, 15% Black and 2% other races. At baseline, the mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 7.7 years and the mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.2%. Established microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline included diabetic nephropathy (0.8%), retinopathy (24%), and peripheral neuropathy (33%). Baseline renal function was eGFR \u2265 60 mL/min/1.73 m 14.2 , 14.3 )] 2 in 98% of patients and eGFR 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in 2% of patients (mean eGFR 92 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of BRENZAVVY in these trials. These adverse reactions occurred more commonly in BRENZAVVY-treated patients than placebo-treated patients, and occurred in at least 2% of BRENZAVVY-treated patients. Table 1.

Percentages calculated with the number of males in each group as denominator: placebo (N = 170), BRENZAVVY (N = 216). f Clinical Trial in Patients with Increased Risk for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events BRENZAVVY was evaluated in a trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established (CVD) or were at increased risk for CVD (Trial 6) [see Clinical Studies ( . Patients on standard of care therapy for diabetes management were randomized to receive add-on therapy with either placebo (N = 567) or BRENZAVVY 20 mg once daily (N = 1,132) for a minimum duration of 52 weeks (median duration 2.4 years). The most common adverse reactions observed in this trial were generally consistent with other trials of BRENZAVVY in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus 14.5 )] (see . Table 1 ) Other Adverse Reactions Lower Limb Amputations An increased incidence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations occurred in BRENZAVVY-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients in a trial (Trial 6) that evaluated adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established CVD or were at increased risk for CVD. Patients in this trial were followed for a median duration of 2.4 years. The lower limb amputation data are shown in Table 2 . Table 2. Non-traumatic Lower Limb Amputation in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus who had either Established Cardiovascular Disease or were at Risk for Cardiovascular Disease (Trial 6 ) Placebo N = 567 BRENZAVVY N = 1,132 Patients with an amputation, n (%) 7 (1.2%) 23 (2.0%) Total amputations 13 25 Amputation incidence rate (per 1,000 patient-years) 5.1 8.3 Hazard Ratio (95% CI) - 1.64 (0.70, 3.82) Note: Incidence is based on the number of patients with at least one amputation, and not the total number of amputation events. A patient\u2019s follow-up is calculated from Day 1 to the first amputation event date. Some patients had more than one amputation. Volume Depletion In a trial of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment (Trial 5), adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., dehydration, dizziness, dizziness postural, vertigo, vertigo positional, presyncope, hypotension, and orthostatic hypotension) were reported in 3.9% and 8.9% of patients treated with placebo and BRENZAVVY, respectively. Genital Mycotic Infections In a pool of three placebo-controlled clinical trials (12-week dose ranging trial and Trials 1 and 2), the incidence of female genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 5.6% of females treated with placebo and BRENZAVVY, respectively (see ). In the same pool of trials, male genital mycotic infections occurred in 1.4% and 2.2% of males treated with placebo and BRENZAVVY, respectively (see Table 1 ). In a trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment (Trial 5), 0% and 9.2% of female patients treated with placebo and BRENZAVVY, respectively, had a genital mycotic infection. Table 1 In a trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established CVD or were at increased risk for CVD (Trial 6), 2.8% and 9.0% of patients treated with placebo and BRENZAVVY, respectively, had at least one event of genital mycotic infection. In the same trial, genital mycotic infections that caused drug discontinuation were reported in 0% and 1.2% of patients treated with placebo and BRENZAVVY, respectively. Balanoposthitis was reported in 0% and 2.9% of male patients, and phimosis was reported in 0.3% and 0.5% of male patients treated with placebo and BRENZAVVY, respectively. Patients treated with BRENZAVVY with events of phimosis typically underwent circumcision. Fractures In a trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established CVD or were at increased risk for CVD (Trial 6), the incidence rates of serious fractures, including events of hip and femur fracture, were 1.4 and 5.4 events per 1,000 patient-years of follow-up in the placebo and BRENZAVVY groups, respectively. The imbalance in serious fractures was observed within the first 6 months of therapy and remained through the end of the trial. Hypoglycemia The incidence of hypoglycemia by trial is shown in . Table 3 Table 3. Incidence of Overall * and Severe \u2020 Hypoglycemia in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Placebo BRENZAVVY Monotherapy (24 weeks) (Trial 1) All subjects -Overall [N (%)] -Severe [N (%)] N = 69 0 (0) 0 (0) N = 138 0 (0) 0 (0) Add-on to Metformin (24 weeks) (Trial 2) All subjects -Overall [N (%)] -Severe [N (%)] N = 159 0 (0) 0 (0) N = 158 1 (0.6) 0 (0) Add-on to Standard of Care Therapy in Patients with Moderate Renal Impairment (24 weeks) (Trial 5) \u03b2 All subjects -Overall [N (%)] -Severe [N (%)] Subjects on background insulin and/or sulfonylurea -Overall [N (%)] -Severe [N (%)] N = 155 0 (0) 0 (0) N = 109 0 (0) 0 (0) N = 157 2 (1.3) 1 (0.6) N = 106 2 (1.9) 1 (0.9) Add-on to Standard of Care Therapy in Patients with Increased CV Risk (Trial 6) \u03b2 All subjects -Overall [N (%)] -Severe [N (%)] Subjects on background insulin and/or sulfonylurea -Overall [N (%)] -Severe [N (%)] N = 567 11 (1.9) 8 (1.4) N = 454 10 (2.2) 8 (1.8) N = 1,132 23 (2.0) 10 (0.9) N = 923 22 (2.4) 10 (1.1) Overall hypoglycemia: plasma or capillary glucose of less than 54 mg/dL. * Severe hypoglycemia: patient required assistance, lost consciousness, or experienced a seizure (irrespective of blood glucose concentration). \u2020 No restrictions were placed on background antihyperglycemic therapy (aside from treatment with another SGLT2 inhibitor) and approximately 50% of patients used insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue at baseline. \u03b2 Rash and Dermatitis In the clinical program of BRENZAVVY, one event of rash and one event of dermatitis was confirmed to be attributable to BRENZAVVY exposure by withdrawal and rechallenge. The rash and dermatitis events occurred on day 37 and day 3 of exposure to BRENZAVVY, respectively. In a trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established CVD or were at increased risk for CVD (Trial 6), 3.4% and 5.4% of patients experienced at least one event of rash with placebo and BRENZAVVY, respectively. Sepsis BRENZAVVY was associated with an increased risk of sepsis/septic shock events, including events that may have caused or contributed to death, in a trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established CVD or were at increased risk for CVD (Trial 6). Sepsis events occurred in 2 (0.4%) and 14 (1.2%) of placebo-treated patients and BRENZAVVY-treated patients in the trial, respectively. Of these, 1 sepsis event among placebo-treated patients and 3 sepsis events among BRENZAVVY-treated patients were related to urinary tract infections. Laboratory Abnormalities Changes in Serum Creatinine and eGFR Initiation of BRENZAVVY causes an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy that stabilizes by week 6 to 12. In a trial enrolling adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate renal impairment (Trial 5), a mean change in serum creatinine of 0.0 mg/dL and a decrease in eGFR of 0.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was observed in the placebo group as compared to a mean increase in serum creatinine of 0.1 mg/dL and a mean decrease in eGFR of 4.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with BRENZAVVY, within the first 6 weeks of treatment. In a trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established CVD or were at increased risk for CVD (Trial 6), an initial decrease in eGFR was seen within weeks of starting therapy (eGFR changes from baseline to week 12 of 0 and -3.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the placebo and BRENZAVVY arms, respectively). Acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the early renal function changes observed with BRENZAVVY since they are reversed after treatment discontinuation. Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) In a pool of two placebo-controlled clinical trials (Trials 1 and 2), mean LDL-C decreased by 3.8 mg/dL (3.7%) in patients treated with placebo (N = 195) and increased by 1.7 mg/dL (1.6%) in patients treated with BRENZAVVY (N = 247) at week 24. In a trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established CVD or were at increased risk for CVD (Trial 6), LDL-C increased by 3 mg/dL (3.2%) and 3 mg/dL (4.1%) with placebo and BRENZAVVY treatment, respectively, at Week 24. Increases in Hemoglobin and Hematocrit In a pool of two placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2), mean changes from baseline to Week 24 in hemoglobin were -0.3 g/dL (-2.1%) with placebo and 0.4 g/dL (2.9%) with BRENZAVVY. In the same pool, mean changes from baseline to Week 24 in hematocrit were -0.6% with placebo and 1.3% with BRENZAVVY 20 mg. Fewer patients had > 2 g/dL increases in hemoglobin from baseline for placebo (0.5%) compared to BRENZAVVY (4.9%). Increases in hemoglobin > 3 g/dL from baseline were observed in 0% of placebo-treated patients compared to 0.7% of BRENZAVVY-treated patients.",
