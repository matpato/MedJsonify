    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension, in particular in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensives; tizanidine should not be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists ( 5.1 , 7.5 ) Risk of liver injury: monitor ALTs; discontinue tizanidine if liver injury occurs ( 5.2 ) Sedation: Tizanidine may interfere with everyday activities; sedative effects of tizanidine, alcohol, and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants are additive ( 5.3 , 7.4 ) Hallucinations: consider discontinuation of tizanidine ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypotension Tizanidine is an \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonist that can produce hypotension [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Drug Interactions ( . Syncope has been reported in patients treated with tizanidine in the postmarketing setting. The risk of hypotension may be minimized by dose titration; monitoring for signs and symptoms of hypotension prior to dosage increase may minimize the risks associated with hypotension. In addition, patients moving from a supine to fixed upright position may be at increased risk for hypotension and orthostatic effects. 7.5 )] Monitor for hypotension when tizanidine is used in patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It is not recommended that tizanidine be used with other \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists. Clinically significant hypotension (decreases in both systolic and diastolic pressure) has been reported with concomitant administration of tizanidine and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Therefore, concomitant use of tizanidine with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is contraindicated 12.3 )] [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Liver Injury Tizanidine may cause hepatocellular liver injury. Liver function test abnormality and hepatotoxicity have been observed with tizanidine [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 )]. Monitoring of aminotransferase levels is recommended at baseline and 1 month after maximum dose is achieved, or if hepatic injury is suspected [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.7 )] 5.3 Sedation Tizanidine can cause sedation, which may interfere with everyday activity. In the multiple dose studies of tizanidine, the prevalence of patients with sedation peaked following the first week of titration and then remained stable for the duration of the maintenance phase of the study [see Adverse Reactions ( The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine with alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive 6.1 )]. [see Drug Interactions ( . Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. 7.4 )] 5.4 Hallucinosis / Psychotic-Like Symptoms Tizanidine use has been associated with hallucinations. Formed, visual hallucinations or delusions were reported in 5 of 170 patients (3%) in two North American controlled clinical studies. Most of the patients were aware that the events were unreal. One patient developed psychosis in association with the hallucinations. One patient among these 5 continued to have problems for at least 2 weeks following discontinuation of tizanidine. Hallucinations have also been reported with tizanidine use in the postmarketing setting. Consider discontinuing tizanidine in patients who develop hallucinations. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Tizanidine can cause anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity, including respiratory compromise, urticaria, and angioedema of the throat and tongue, have been reported. Tizanidine is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to tizanidine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Tizanidine can cause withdrawal adverse reactions, which include rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and hypertonia. To minimize the risk of these reactions, particularly in patients who have been receiving high doses of tizanidine (20 to 28 mg daily) for long periods of time (9 weeks or more) or who may be on concomitant treatment with narcotics, the tizanidine dosage should be decreased slowly [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )].",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in other sections of the prescribing information: \u2022 Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Liver Injury [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hallucinosis/Psychotic-Like Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 10% of patients taking tizanidine and greater than in patients taking placebo) were dry mouth, somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of tizanidine has been evaluated in three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies [see Clinical Studies ( . Two studies were conducted in patients with multiple sclerosis and one in patients with spinal cord injury. Each study had a 13-week active treatment period which included a 3-week titration phase to the maximum tolerated dose up to 36 mg/day in three divided doses, a 9-week plateau phase where the dose of tizanidine was held constant and a 1-week dose tapering period. In all, 264 patients received tizanidine and 261 patients received placebo. Across the three studies approximately 51% of patients were women, and the median dose during the plateau phase ranged from 20 to 28 mg/day. 14 )] The most common adverse reactions (>10% of patients treated with tizanidine) reported in multiple dose, placebo-controlled clinical studies involving 264 patients with spasticity were dry mouth, somnolence/sedation, asthenia (weakness, fatigue and/or tiredness), and dizziness. Three-quarters of the patients rated the reactions as mild to moderate and one-quarter of the patients rated the reactions as being severe. These adverse reactions appeared to be dose related. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 2% of patients in three multiple dose, placebo-controlled studies who received tizanidine where the frequency in the tizanidine group was greater than the placebo group.

In addition, hypotension and bradycardia were observed. The occurrence of these reactions is summarized in Table 2. Other events were, in general, reported at a rate of 2% or less. 14 )] Table 2:\u00a0 Single Dose, Placebo-Controlled Study\u2014Common Adverse Reactions Reported Adverse Reaction Placebo N = 48 % Tizanidine Tablet, 8mg, N = 45 % Tizanidine Tablet, 16 mg, N = 49 % Somnolence 31 78 92 Dry mouth 35 76 88 Asthenia 40 67 78 Dizziness 4 22 45 Hypotension 0 16 33 Bradycardia 0 2 10 *includes weakness, fatigue, and/or tiredness 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tizanidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: Ventricular tachycardia, decreased blood pressure Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( , hepatitis 5.2 )] Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: arthralgia Nervous System Disorders: Convulsion, paresthesia, tremor, muscle spasms Psychiatric Disorders: Hallucinations [see Warnings and Precautions ( , depression 5.4 )] Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Stevens Johnson Syndrome, anaphylactic reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( , exfoliative dermatitis, rash 5.5 )]",
