    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis: See boxed warning. ( 5.1 ) Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.2 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin\u00ad associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets. In metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablet and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal impairment \u2014 The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient\u2019s renal function include [ : see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Before initiating metformin hydrochloride tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) ]. Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Drug interactions \u2014The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or greater \u2014The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient\u2019s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. Radiologic studies with contrast \u2014Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging \u00a0\u00a0procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable. Surgery and other procedures \u2014Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic states \u2014Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets. Excessive alcohol intake \u2014Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets. Hepatic impairment \u2014Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin- associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency In metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride tablets and manage any abnormalities [see ]. Adverse Reactions (6.1) 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride tablet [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.4 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride tablets.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Lactic Acidosis [ see Boxed Warning and ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) Vitamin B12 Deficiency [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) For metformin hydrochloride tablets, the most common adverse reactions (>5.0%) are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Granules Pharmaceuticals Inc at 1-877-770-3183 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets In a U.S. clinical trial of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride tablets up to 2550 mg per day. Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5% of metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients and that were more common than in placebo-treated patients, are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions from a Clinical Trial of Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets Occurring >5% and More Common than Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets (n=141) Placebo (n=145) Diarrhea 53% 12% Nausea/Vomiting 26% 8% Flatulence 12% 6% Asthenia 9% 6% Indigestion 7% 4% Abdominal Discomfort 6% 5% Headache 6% 5% Diarrhea led to discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets in 6% of patients. Additionally, the following adverse reactions were reported in \u22651 % to \u22645% of metformin hydrochloride tablets treated patients and were more commonly reported with metformin hydrochloride tablets than placebo: abnormal stools, hypoglycemia, myalgia, lightheaded, dyspnea, nail disorder, rash, sweating increased, taste disorder, chest discomfort, chills, flu syndrome, flushing, palpitation. In metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Pediatric Patients In clinical trials with metformin hydrochloride tablets in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the profile of adverse reactions was similar to that observed in adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin.",
