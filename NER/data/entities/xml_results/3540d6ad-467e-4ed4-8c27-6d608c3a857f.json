Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue), because of an increased risk of hypertensive crisis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Known hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to amphetamine ( 4 ) During or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) ( 4 , 7.1 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease: Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Monitor blood pressure and pulse at appropriate intervals. ( 5.3 ) Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: Prior to initiating ADDERALL XR, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. If new psychotic or manic symptoms occur, consider discontinuing ADDERALL XR. ( 5.4 ) Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients: Closely monitor growth (height and weight) in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. ( 5.5 ) Seizures: May lower the convulsive threshold. Discontinue in the presence of seizures. ( 5.6 ) Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon: Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during ADDERALL XR treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. ( 5.7 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when coadministered with serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans), but also during overdosage situations. If it occurs, discontinue ADDERALL XR and initiate supportive treatment. ( 4 , 5.8 , 10 ) Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome: Before initiating ADDERALL XR, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Regularly monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 \tAbuse, Misuse, and Addiction ADDERALL XR has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of ADDERALL XR exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. ADDERALL XR can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see . Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including ADDERALL XR, can result in overdose and death Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2) ] [see , and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. Overdosage (10) ] Before prescribing ADDERALL XR, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store ADDERALL XR in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give ADDERALL XR to anyone else. Throughout ADDERALL XR treatment, reassess each patient\u2019s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. 5.2 \tRisks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid ADDERALL XR use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. 5.3\tIncreased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate CNS stimulants may cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 bpm). Monitor all ADDERALL XR-treated patients for hypertension and tachycardia. 5.4\tPsychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Psychosis Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with pre-existing psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disease CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients. Prior to initiating ADDERALL XR treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression). New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing ADDERALL XR. 5.5\tLong-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in ADDERALL XR-treated pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants. In a controlled trial of ADDERALL XR in adolescents, mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 lbs. and -2.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 10 and 20 mg ADDERALL XR. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment. Chronic use of amphetamines can be expected to cause a similar suppression of growth [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. 5.6 \tSeizures There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, ADDERALL XR should be discontinued. 5.7 \tPeripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon CNS stimulants, including ADDERALL XR, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports and at the therapeutic dosage of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or discontinuation of the CNS stimulant. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during ADDERALL XR treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for ADDERALL XR-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. 5.8\tSerotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as MAOIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John\u2019s Wort [see . Amphetamines and amphetamine derivatives are known to be metabolized, to some degree, by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and display minor inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism Drug Interactions (7.1) ] [see . The potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction exists with the coadministration of CYP2D6 inhibitors which may increase the risk with increased exposure to ADDERALL XR. In these situations, consider an alternative nonserotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] [see . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Concomitant use of ADDERALL XR with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see . Contraindications (4) ] Discontinue treatment with ADDERALL XR and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. Concomitant use of ADDERALL XR with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. If clinically warranted, consider initiating ADDERALL XR with lower doses, monitoring patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and informing patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome. 5.9 \tMotor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome CNS stimulants, including amphetamine, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette\u2019s syndrome has also been reported [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Before initiating ADDERALL XR, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Regularly monitor ADDERALL XR-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.",

The premarketing development program for ADDERALL XR included exposures in a total of 1,315 participants in clinical trials (635 pediatric patients, 350 adolescent patients, 248 adult patients, and 82 healthy adult subjects). Of these, 635 patients (ages 6 to 12) were evaluated in two controlled clinical studies, one open-label clinical study, and two single-dose clinical pharmacology studies (N=40). Safety data on all patients are included in the discussion that follows. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, weights, laboratory analyses, and ECGs. Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized event categories. In the tables and listings that follow, COSTART terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment In two placebo-controlled studies of up to 5 weeks duration among children with ADHD, 2.4% (10/425) of ADDERALL XR-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions (including three patients with loss of appetite, one of whom also reported insomnia) compared to 2.7% (7/259) receiving placebo. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of ADDERALL XR in controlled and uncontrolled, multiple-dose clinical trials of children (N=595) were anorexia (loss of appetite) (2.9%), insomnia (1.5%), weight loss (1.2%), emotional lability (1%), and depression (0.7%). Over half of these patients were exposed to ADDERALL XR for 12 months or more. In a separate placebo-controlled 4 week study in adolescents with ADHD, five patients (2.1%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among ADDERALL XR-treated patients (N=233) compared to none who received placebo (N=54). The most frequent adverse event leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of ADDERALL XR-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) was insomnia (1.3%, n=3). In one placebo-controlled 4 week study among adults with ADHD with doses 20 to 60 mg, 23 patients (12.0%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among ADDERALL XR-treated patients (N=191) compared to one patient (1.6%) who received placebo (N=64). The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of ADDERALL XR-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (5.2%, n=10), anxiety (2.1%, n=4), nervousness (1.6%, n=3), dry mouth (1.6%, n=3), anorexia (1.6%, n=3), tachycardia (1.6%, n=3), headache (1.6%, n=3), and asthenia (1.0%, n=2). Adverse Reactions Occurring in Controlled Trials Adverse reactions reported in a 3 week clinical trial of children and a 4 week clinical trial in adolescents and adults, respectively, treated with ADDERALL XR or placebo are presented in the tables below.

Cardiovascular System Tachycardia 6% 3% Metabolic/Nutritional Weight Loss 10% 0% Urogenital System Urinary Tract Infection 5% 0% Hypertension In a controlled 4 week outpatient clinical study of adolescents with ADHD, isolated systolic blood pressure elevations \u226515 mmHg were observed in 7/64 (11%) placebo-treated patients and 7/100 (7%) patients receiving ADDERALL XR 10 or 20 mg. Isolated elevations in diastolic blood pressure \u22658 mmHg were observed in 16/64 (25%) placebo-treated patients and 22/100 (22%) ADDERALL XR-treated patients. Similar results were observed at higher doses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. In a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in 23 adolescents with ADHD, isolated increases in systolic blood pressure (above the upper 95% CI for age, gender, and stature) were observed in 2/17 (12%) and 8/23 (35%), subjects administered 10 and 20 mg ADDERALL XR, respectively. Higher single doses were associated with a greater increase in systolic blood pressure. All increases were transient, appeared maximal at 2 to 4 hours postdose and, not associated with symptoms. 6.2 \tAdverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Amphetamine, ADDERALL XR, or Adderall The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of amphetamine, ADDERALL XR, or Adderall. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Allergic: Urticaria, rash, hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and anaphylaxis. Serious skin rashes, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. Cardiovascular: Palpitations. There have been isolated reports of cardiomyopathy associated with chronic amphetamine use. Central Nervous System: Psychotic episodes at recommended doses, overstimulation, restlessness, irritability, euphoria, dyskinesia, dysphoria, depression, tremor, motor and verbal tics, aggression, anger, logorrhea, dermatillomania, paresthesia (including formication), and bruxism. Endocrine: Impotence, changes in libido, frequent or prolonged erections. Eye Disorders: Vision blurred, mydriasis. Gastrointestinal: Unpleasant taste, constipation, intestinal ischemia, and other gastrointestinal disturbances. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Rhabdomyolysis. Skin: Alopecia. Vascular Disorders: Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.",
