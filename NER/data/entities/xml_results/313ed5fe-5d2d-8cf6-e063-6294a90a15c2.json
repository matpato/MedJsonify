    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefdinir and other antibacterial drugs, cefdinir should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Cefdinir capsules, USP\u00a0are indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below. Adults and Adolescents Community-Acquired Pneumonia caused by Haemophilus influenzae (including \u03b2-lactamase producing strains), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (including \u03b2-lactamase producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains only), and Moraxella catarrhalis (including \u03b2-lactamase producing strains) (see ).

    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Cefdinir capsules are contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFDINIR IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFDINIR, OTHER CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF CEFDINIR IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG \u03b2-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY. IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFDINIR OCCURS, THE DRUG SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefdinir, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD.\u00a0 Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy.\u00a0 CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following\u00a0antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing\u00a0antibacterial use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation,\u00a0antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing cefdinir in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. As with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged treatment may result in the possible emergence and overgrowth of resistant organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate alternative therapy should be administered. Cefdinir, as with other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (antibiotics), should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of colitis. In patients with transient or persistent renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), the total daily dose of cefdinir should be reduced because high and prolonged plasma concentrations of cefdinir can result following recommended doses (see ). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefdinir should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefdinir is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefdinir or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Antacids containing magnesium or aluminum interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If this type of antacid is required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the antacid. Iron supplements, including multivitamins that contain iron, interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement. Iron-fortified infant formula does not significantly interfere with the absorption of cefdinir. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued.\u00a0 Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic.\u00a0If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Drug Interactions (aluminum- or magnesium-containing) Antacids Concomitant administration of 300 mg cefdinir capsules with 30 mL Maalox \u00ae TC suspension reduces the rate (C max ) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%. Time to reach C max is also prolonged by 1 hour. There are no significant effects on cefdinir pharmacokinetics if the antacid is administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after cefdinir. If antacids are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the antacid. Probenecid As with other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of cefdinir, resulting in an approximate doubling in AUC, a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination t \u00bd . Iron Supplements and Foods Fortified With Iron Concomitant administration of cefdinir with a therapeutic iron supplement containing\u00a060 mg of elemental iron (as FeSO 4 ) or vitamins supplemented with 10 mg of elemental iron reduced extent of absorption by 80% and 31%, respectively. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir therapy, cefdinir should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement. The effect of foods highly fortified with elemental iron (primarily iron-fortified breakfast cereals) on cefdinir absorption has not been studied. Concomitantly administered iron-fortified infant formula (2.2 mg elemental iron/6 oz) has no significant effect on cefdinir pharmacokinetics. There have been reports of reddish stools in patients receiving cefdinir. In many cases, patients were also receiving iron-containing products. The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between cefdinir or its breakdown products and iron in the gastrointestinal tract. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using nitroprusside, but not with those using nitroferricyanide. The administration of cefdinir may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in urine using Clinitest \u00ae , Benedict\u2019s solution, or Fehling\u2019s solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix \u00ae or Tes-Tape \u00ae ) be used. Cephalosporins are known to occasionally induce a positive direct Coombs\u2019 test. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of cefdinir has not been evaluated. No mutagenic effects were seen in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) or point mutation assay at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus (HGPRT) in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells. No clastogenic effects were observed in vitro in the structural chromosome aberration assay in V79 Chinese hamster lung cells or in vivo in the micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow. In rats, fertility and reproductive performance were not affected by cefdinir at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (70 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 11 times based on mg/m 2 /day). Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Cefdinir was not teratogenic in rats at oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day (70 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 11 times based on mg/m 2 /day) or in rabbits at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (0.7 times the human dose based on mg/kg/day, 0.23 times based on mg/m 2 /day). Maternal toxicity (decreased body weight gain) was observed in rabbits at the maximum tolerated dose of 10 mg/kg/day without adverse effects on offspring. Decreased body weight occurred in rat fetuses at \u2265100 mg/kg/day, and in rat offspring at \u226532 mg/kg/day. No effects were observed on maternal reproductive parameters or offspring survival, development, behavior, or reproductive function. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Cefdinir has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Nursing Mothers Following administration of single 600 mg doses, cefdinir was not detected in human breast milk. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in neonates and infants less than 6 months of age have not been established. Use of cefdinir for the treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis in pediatric patients (age 6 months through 12 years) is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and adolescents, the similar pathophysiology of acute sinusitis in adult and pediatric patients, and comparative pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population. Geriatric Use Efficacy is comparable in geriatric patients and younger adults.\u00a0While cefdinir has been well-tolerated in all age groups, in clinical trials geriatric patients experienced a lower rate of adverse events, including diarrhea, than younger adults.\u00a0Dose adjustment in elderly patients is not necessary unless renal function is markedly compromised (see ).

    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE EVENTS Clinical Trials - Cefdinir Capsules (Adult and Adolescent Patients) In clinical trials, 5093 adult and adolescent patients (3841 U.S. and 1252 non-U.S.) were treated with the recommended dose of cefdinir capsules (600 mg/day). Most adverse events were mild and self-limiting. No deaths or permanent disabilities were attributed to cefdinir. One hundred forty-seven of 5093 (3%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events thought by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely associated with cefdinir therapy. The discontinuations were primarily for gastrointestinal disturbances, usually diarrhea or nausea. Nineteen of 5093 (0.4%) patients were discontinued due to rash thought related to cefdinir administration. In the U.S., the following adverse events were thought by investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to cefdinir capsules in multiple-dose clinical trials (N = 3841 cefdinir-treated patients): ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CEFDINIR CAPSULES U.S. TRIALS IN ADULT AND ADOLESCENT PATIENTS (N = 3841) a a 1733 males, 2108 females Incidence \u22651% Diarrhea 15% Vaginal moniliasis 4% of women Nausea 3% Headache 2% Abdominal pain 1% Vaginitis 1% of women Incidence <1% but >0.1% Rash 0.9% Dyspepsia 0.7% Flatulence 0.7% Vomiting 0.7% Abnormal stools 0.3% Anorexia 0.3% Constipation 0.3% Dizziness 0.3% Dry mouth 0.3% Asthenia 0.2% Insomnia 0.2% Leukorrhea 0.2% of women Moniliasis 0.2% Pruritus 0.2% Somnolence 0.2% The following laboratory value changes of possible clinical significance, irrespective of relationship to therapy with cefdinir, were seen during clinical trials conducted in the U.S.: LABORATORY VALUE CHANGES OBSERVED WITH CEFDINIR CAPSULES U.S. TRIALS IN ADULT AND ADOLESCENT PATIENTS (N = 3841) a N <3841 for these parameters Incidence \u22651% \u2191Urine leukocytes 2% \u2191Urine protein 2% \u2191Gamma-glutamyltransferase a 1% \u2193Lymphocytes, \u2191Lymphocytes 1%, 0.2% \u2191Microhematuria 1% Incidence <1% but >0.1% \u2191Glucose a 0.9% \u2191Urine glucose 0.9% \u2191White blood cells, \u2193White blood cells 0.9%, 0.7% \u2191Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 0.7% \u2191Eosinophils 0.7% \u2191Urine specific gravity, \u2193Urine specific gravity a 0.6%, 0.2% \u2193Bicarbonate a 0.6% \u2191Phosphorus, \u2193Phosphorus a 0.6%, 0.3% \u2191Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 0.4% \u2191Alkaline phosphatase 0.3% \u2191Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 0.3% \u2193Hemoglobin 0.3% \u2191Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs),\u00a0 \u2193PMNs 0.3%, 0.2% \u2191Bilirubin 0.2% \u2191Lactate dehydrogenase a 0.2% \u2191Platelets 0.2% \u2191Potassium a 0.2% \u2191Urine pH a 0.2% Clinical Trials - Cefdinir for Oral Suspension (Pediatric Patients) In clinical trials, 2289 pediatric patients (1783 U.S. and 506 non-U.S.) were treated with the recommended dose of cefdinir suspension (14 mg/kg/day). Most adverse events were mild and self-limiting. No deaths or permanent disabilities were attributed to cefdinir. Forty of 2289 (2%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse events considered by the investigators to be possibly, probably, or definitely associated with cefdinir therapy.

Cephalosporin Class Adverse Events The following adverse events and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibiotics in general: Allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, false-positive test for urinary glucose, neutropenia, pancytopenia, and agranulocytosis. Pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may begin during or after antibiotic treatment (see ). WARNINGS Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced (see and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated. OVERDOSAGE",
