Limitations of Use : The safety and effectiveness of colchicine capsules for acute treatment of gout flares during prophylaxis has not been studied. Colchicine capsules are not an analgesic medication and should not be used to treat pain from other causes. Colchicine capsules are an alkaloid indicated for prophylaxis of gout flares in adults ( 1 ). Limitations of Use : \u2022 The safety and effectiveness of colchicine capsules for acute treatment of gout flares during prophylaxis has not been studied. \u2022 Colchicine capsules are not an analgesic medication and should not be used to treat pain from other causes.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine capsules with drugs that inhibit both P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitors [see . Combining these dual inhibitors with colchicine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has resulted in life-threatening or fatal colchicine toxicity. Drug Interactions (7) ] Patients with both renal and hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine capsules. \u2022 Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine capsules in conjunction with drugs that inhibit both P-gp and CYP3A4 ( 4 ). \u2022 Patients with both renal and hepatic impairment should not be given colchicine capsules ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Fatal overdoses have been reported with colchicine in adults and children. Keep colchicine capsules out of the reach of children ( 5.1 , 10 ). \u2022 Blood dyscrasias: Myelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia have been reported ( 5.2 ). \u2022 Monitor for toxicity and if present consider temporary interruption or discontinuation of colchicine ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 6 , 10 ). \u2022 Drug interaction with dual P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors: Co-administration of colchicine with dual P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors has resulted in life-threatening interactions and death ( 5.3 , 7 ). \u2022 Neuromuscular toxicity: Myotoxicity including rhabdomyolysis may occur, especially in combination with other drugs known to cause this effect. Consider temporary interruption or discontinuation of colchicine capsules ( 5.4 , 7 ). 5.1 Fatal Overdose Fatal overdoses, both accidental and intentional, have been reported in adults and children who have ingested colchicine [see . Colchicine capsules should be kept out of the reach of children. Overdosage ( 10) ] 5.2 Blood Dyscrasias Myelosuppression, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia have been reported with colchicine used in therapeutic doses. 5.3 Interactions with CYP3A4 and P-gp Inhibitors Because colchicine is a substrate for both the CYP3A4 metabolizing enzyme and the P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, inhibition of either of these pathways may lead to colchicine-related toxicity. Inhibition of both CYP3A4 and P-gp by dual inhibitors such as clarithromycin has been reported to produce life-threatening or fatal colchicine toxicity due to significant increases in systemic colchicine levels. Therefore, concomitant use of colchicine capsules and inhibitors of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein should be avoided [see .\u00a0 If avoidance is not possible, reduced daily dose should be considered and the patient should be monitored closely for colchicine toxicity. Use of colchicine capsules in conjunction with drugs that inhibit both P-gp and CYP3A4 is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment Drug Interactions (7) ] [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.4 Neuromuscular Toxicity Neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis have been reported from chronic treatment with colchicine in therapeutic doses, especially in combination with other drugs known to cause this effect. Patients with impaired renal function and elderly patients (even those with normal renal and hepatic function) are at increased risk. Once colchicine treatment is ceased, the symptoms generally resolve within 1 week to several months.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Gastrointestinal disorders are the most common adverse reactions with colchicine. They are often the first signs of toxicity and may indicate that the colchicine dosage needs to be reduced or therapy stopped. These include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Colchicine has been reported to cause neuromuscular toxicity, which may present as muscle pain or weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Toxic manifestations associated with colchicine include myelosuppression, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and injury to cells in the renal, hepatic, circulatory, and central nervous system. These most often occur with excessive accumulation or overdosage [see Overdosage (10) ]. The following reactions have been reported with colchicine. These have been generally reversible by interrupting treatment or lowering the dose of colchicine: Digestive : abdominal cramping, abdominal pain, diarrhea, lactose intolerance, nausea, vomiting Neurological : sensory motor neuropathy Dermatological : alopecia, maculopapular rash, purpura, rash Hematological : leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia Hepatobiliary : elevated AST, elevated ALT Musculoskeletal : myopathy, elevated CPK, myotonia, muscle weakness, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis Reproductive : azoospermia, oligospermia The most commonly reported adverse reactions with colchicine are gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain ( 6 ).
