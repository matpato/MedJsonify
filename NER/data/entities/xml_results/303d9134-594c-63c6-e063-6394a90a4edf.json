    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cefuroxime axetil tablet is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible bacteria: (1) Pharyngitis/tonsillitis (adults and pediatric patients) ( 1.1 ) Acute bacterial otitis media (pediatric patients) ( 1.2 ) Acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis (adults and pediatric patients) ( 1.3 ) Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (adults and pediatric patients 13 years and older) ( 1.4 ) Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections (adults and pediatric patients 13 years and older) ( 1.5 ) Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (adults and pediatric patients 13 years and older) ( 1.6 ) Uncomplicated gonorrhea (adults and pediatric patients 13 years and older) ( 1.7 ) Early Lyme disease (adults and pediatric patients 13 years and older) ( 1.8 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil and other antibacterial drugs, cefuroxime axetil should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. 1.1 Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (13 years and older) with mild-to-moderate pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pyogenes . Limitations of Use The efficacy of cefuroxime axetil in the prevention of rheumatic fever was not established in clinical trials. The efficacy of cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of penicillin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pyogenes has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. 1.2 Acute Bacterial Otitis Media Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients (who can swallow tablets whole) with acute bacterial otitis media caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing strains), or Streptococcus pyogenes . 1.3 Acute Bacterial Maxillary Sinusitis Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (13 years and older) with mild-to-moderate acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae (non -\u03b2 -lactamase\u2013producing strains only). Limitations of Use The effectiveness of Cefuroxime axetil for sinus infections caused by \u03b2-lactamase\u2013producing Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis in patients with acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis was not established due to insufficient numbers of these isolates in the clinical trials [see Clinical Studies ( . 14.1 )] 1.4 Acute Bacterial Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with mild-to-moderate acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused by susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae (\u03b2-lactamase\u2013negative strains), or Haemophilus parainfluenzae (\u03b2-lactamase\u2013negative strains). 1.5 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin-Structure Infections Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus (including \u03b2 - lactamase\u2013producing strains) or Streptococcus pyogenes. 1.6 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae . 1.7 Uncomplicated Gonorrhea Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with uncomplicated gonorrhea, urethral and endocervical, caused by penicillinase-producing and non-penicillinase\u2013producing susceptible strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and uncomplicated gonorrhea, rectal, in females, caused by non-penicillinase\u2013producing susceptible strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae . 1.8 Early Lyme Disease (erythema migrans) Cefuroxime axetil tablets are indicated for the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients (aged 13 and older) with early Lyme disease (erythema migrans) caused by susceptible strains of Borrelia burgdorferi. 1.10 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefuroxime axetil and other antibacterial drugs, cefuroxime axetil should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions: In the event of a serious reaction, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) -associated diarrhea (CDAD): If diarrhea occurs, evaluate patients for CDAD. ( Clostridioides difficile 5.2 ) 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on \u03b2-lactam antibacterials, including cefuroxime axetil [see Adverse Reactions ( . These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of \u03b2-lactam hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Cefuroxime axetil is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to cefuroxime axetil or other \u03b2-lactam antibacterial drugs 6.2 )] [see Contraindications ( . Before initiating therapy with cefuroxime axetil, inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue cefuroxime axetil and institute appropriate therapy. 4 )] 5.2 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefuroxime axetil, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile- C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. 5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefuroxime axetil either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 5.6 Interference with Glucose Tests A false-positive result for glucose in the urine may occur with copper reduction tests, and a false-negative result for blood/plasma glucose may occur with ferricyanide tests in subjects receiving cefuroxime axetil [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.3) ]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious and otherwise important adverse reaction is described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label: Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. The most common adverse reactions (\u22653%) for cefuroxime axetil tablets are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, and vaginitis (early Lyme disease).

Tablets Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens with 7 to 10 Days\u2019 Duration : In multiple-dose clinical trials, 912 subjects were treated with cefuroxime axetil (125 to 500 mg twice daily). It is noted that 125 mg twice daily is not an approved dosage. Twenty (2.2%) subjects discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Seventeen (85%) of the 20 subjects who discontinued therapy did so because of gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The percentage of subjects treated with cefuroxime axetil who discontinued study drug because of adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 1,000, 500, and 250 mg (2.3%, 2.1%, and 2.2%, respectively). However, the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions increased with the higher recommended doses. The adverse reactions in Table 5 are for subjects (n = 912) treated with cefuroxime axetil in multiple-dose clinical trials. Table 5.
