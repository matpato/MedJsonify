Ensure patients increase oral fluid intake and advise patients to void as often as possible to reduce bladder radiation. ( 5.1 ) Myelosuppression : Perform complete blood counts. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue PLUVICTO based on severity. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Renal Toxicity : Advise patients to remain well hydrated and to urinate frequently. Perform kidney function laboratory tests. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue PLUVICTO based on severity. ( 2.4 , 5.3 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) Infertility : PLUVICTO may cause temporary or permanent infertility. ( 5.5 , 8.3 ) 5.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk From Radiation Exposure PLUVICTO contributes to a patient\u2019s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. Minimize radiation exposure to patients, medical personnel, and others during and after treatment with PLUVICTO consistent with institutional good radiation safety practices, patient treatment procedures, Nuclear Regulatory Commission patient-release guidance, and instructions to the patient for follow-up radiation protection at home. Ensure patients increase oral fluid intake and advise patients to void as often as possible to reduce bladder radiation. Before the patient is released, inform patients about the necessary radioprotection precautions to follow to minimize radiation exposure to others [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . After each administration of PLUVICTO, advise patients to: Limit close contact (less than 3 feet) with others for 2 days or with children and pregnant women for 7 days. Refrain from sexual activity for 7 days. Sleep in a separate room from others for 3 days, from children for 7 days, or from pregnant women for 15 days. 5.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Myelosuppression PLUVICTO can cause severe and life-threatening myelosuppression, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and neutropenia. In the PSMAfore study, Grade 3 or 4 decreased hemoglobin (7%), decreased leukocytes (4.4%), decreased neutrophils (3.5%), and decreased platelets (2.7%) occurred in patients treated with PLUVICTO. One death occurred due to bone marrow failure during long-term follow-up in a patient who received PLUVICTO. In the VISION study, Grade 3 or 4 decreased hemoglobin (15%), decreased platelets (9%), decreased leukocytes (7%), and decreased neutrophils (4.5%) occurred in patients treated with PLUVICTO. Grade \u2265 3 pancytopenia occurred in 1.1% (which includes two fatal events) of patients treated with PLUVICTO. Two deaths (0.4%) occurred due to intracranial hemorrhage and subdural hematoma in association with thrombocytopenia, one death (0.2%) occurred due to sepsis and concurrent neutropenia, and one death (0.2%) occurred due to bone marrow failure. Perform complete blood counts before and during treatment with PLUVICTO. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue PLUVICTO based on the severity of myelosuppression [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Renal Toxicity PLUVICTO can cause severe renal toxicity. In the PSMAfore study, Grade 3 or 4 acute kidney injury (1.3%) occurred in patients treated with PLUVICTO. In the VISION study, Grade 3 or 4 acute kidney injury (3.4%) occurred in patients treated with PLUVICTO. Advise patients to remain well hydrated and to urinate frequently before and after administration of PLUVICTO. Perform kidney function laboratory tests, including serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance (CLcr), before and during treatment with PLUVICTO. Withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue PLUVICTO based on the severity of renal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . 5.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryo-Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of PLUVICTO have not been established in females. Based on its mechanism of action, PLUVICTO can cause fetal harm [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . No animal studies using lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan have been conducted to evaluate its effect on female reproduction and embryo-fetal development; however, radioactive emissions, including those from PLUVICTO, can cause fetal harm. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PLUVICTO and for 14 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)] . 5.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Infertility PLUVICTO may cause infertility in males. The recommended cumulative dose of 44.4 GBq of PLUVICTO results in a radiation absorbed dose to the testes within the range where PLUVICTO may cause temporary or permanent infertility [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)] .",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Renal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased lymphocytes, decreased hemoglobin, fatigue, dry mouth, decreased platelets, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate, nausea, decreased neutrophils, decreased calcium, decreased sodium, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alkaline phosphatase, arthralgia, decreased appetite, increased potassium, constipation, and back pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the pooled safety population for the PSMAfore and VISION studies (N = 756), the most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were decreased lymphocytes (83%), decreased hemoglobin (65%), fatigue (49%), dry mouth (46%), decreased platelets (40%), decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (37%), nausea (35%), decreased neutrophils (31%), decreased calcium (29%), decreased sodium (27%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (26%), increased alkaline phosphatase (24%), arthralgia (22%), decreased appetite (21%), increased potassium (21%), constipation (21%), and back pain (21%). PSMAfore The safety of PLUVICTO was evaluated in the PSMAfore study in patients with progressive, PSMA-positive mCRPC previously treated with ARPI therapy, for whom it was considered appropriate to delay taxane-based chemotherapy by the investigator [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients received at least one dose of either PLUVICTO 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) administered every 6 weeks (N = 227) or a change in ARPI (N = 232). The median duration of exposure to PLUVICTO was 8.4 months (range, 0.4 to 11.6), and the median number of doses of PLUVICTO received was 6 (range, 1 to 6). The median cumulative administered activity of PLUVICTO was 42.4 GBq (range, 7.0 to 45.4). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients who received PLUVICTO. Serious adverse reactions in > 1% of patients who received PLUVICTO included anemia (1.8%), urinary tract infection (1.8%), hemorrhage (1.3%), and sepsis (1.3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.8% of patients who received PLUVICTO, including COVID-19 pneumonia, cardiac arrest, intestinal ischemia, and sepsis (0.4% each). PLUVICTO was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 6% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of PLUVICTO in \u2265 1% of patients who received PLUVICTO were thrombocytopenia (1.8%) and dry mouth (1.3%). Adverse reactions leading to a dose interruption of PLUVICTO occurred in 12% of patients. The most frequent (\u2265 1%) adverse reactions leading to a dose interruption of PLUVICTO in patients who received PLUVICTO were COVID-19 (3.1%) and anemia (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction of PLUVICTO occurred in 3.5% of patients. The most frequent (\u2265 0.5%) adverse reaction leading to a dose reduction of PLUVICTO in patients who received PLUVICTO was dry mouth (0.9%).

Patients received at least one dose of either PLUVICTO 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) administered every 6 weeks plus BSoC (N = 529) or BSoC alone (N = 205). The median duration of exposure to PLUVICTO plus BSoC was 7.8 months (range, 0.3 to 36.5). Among patients who received PLUVICTO plus BSoC, the median number of doses of PLUVICTO received was 5 (range, 1 to 6). The median cumulative administered activity of PLUVICTO was 37.5 GBq (range, 7.0 to 48.3). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients who received PLUVICTO plus BSoC. Serious adverse reactions in > 1% of patients who received PLUVICTO plus BSoC included musculoskeletal pain (4%), hemorrhage (4%), sepsis (3.2%), urinary tract infection (3%), anemia (2.8%), acute kidney injury (1.9%), pneumonia (1.7%), pyrexia (1.5%), pancytopenia (1.3%), spinal cord compression (1.1%), and pulmonary embolism (1.1%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients who received PLUVICTO plus BSoC, including sepsis (0.9%), pancytopenia (0.6%), hepatic failure (0.4%), intracranial hemorrhage (0.2%), subdural hematoma (0.2%), ischemic stroke (0.2%), COVID-19 (0.2%), and aspiration pneumonia (0.2%). PLUVICTO was permanently discontinued due to adverse reactions in 12% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of PLUVICTO in \u2265 1% of patients who received PLUVICTO plus BSoC were anemia (2.8%), thrombocytopenia (2.8%), and leukopenia (including neutropenia) (1.7%). Adverse reactions leading to a dose interruption of PLUVICTO occurred in 16% of patients. The most frequent (\u2265 3%) adverse reactions leading to a dose interruption of PLUVICTO in patients who received PLUVICTO plus BSoC were anemia (5%) and thrombocytopenia (3.6%). Adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction of PLUVICTO occurred in 6% of patients. The most frequent (\u2265 1%) adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction of PLUVICTO in patients who received PLUVICTO plus BSoC were thrombocytopenia (1.9%) and anemia (1.3%). Table 5 and Table 6 summarize the incidence of adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in VISION.
