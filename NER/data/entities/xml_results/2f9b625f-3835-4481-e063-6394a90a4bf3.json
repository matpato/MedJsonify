    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute Kidney Injury: Measure serum creatinine in duplicate before starting therapy. Monitor renal function during deferasirox therapy and reduce dose or interrupt therapy for toxicity. ( 2.1 , 2.4 , 5.1 ) Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor hepatic function. Reduce dose or interrupt therapy for toxicity. ( 5.2 ) Fatal and Nonfatal Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Irritation: Risk may be greater in patients who are taking deferasirox in combination with drugs that have known ulcerogenic or hemorrhagic potential. ( 5.3 ) Bone Marrow Suppression: Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, worsening anemia, and thrombocytopenia, including fatal events; monitor blood counts during deferasirox therapy. Interrupt therapy for toxicity. ( 5.4 ) Age-related Risk of Toxicity: Monitor elderly and pediatric patients closely for toxicity. ( 5.5 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Discontinue deferasirox for severe reactions and institute medical intervention. ( 5.7 ) Severe Skin Reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue deferasirox. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Acute Kidney Injury, Including Acute Renal Failure Requiring Dialysis, and Renal Tubular Toxicity Including Fanconi Syndrome Deferasirox is contraindicated in patients with eGFR less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Exercise caution in pediatric patients with eGFR between 40\u00a0mL/minute/1.73 m 2 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 . If treatment is needed, use the minimum effective dose and monitor renal function frequently. Individualize dose titration based on improvement in renal injury [see Use in Specific Populations ( . For patients with renal impairment (eGFR 40 mL/min/1.73 m 8.6 )] 2 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), reduce the starting dose by 50% [see\u00a0Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 , 2.5 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Deferasirox can cause acute kidney injury including renal failure requiring dialysis that has resulted in fatal outcomes. Based on postmarketing experience, most fatalities have occurred in patients with multiple comorbidities and who were in advanced stages of their hematological disorders. In the clinical trials, adult and pediatric deferasirox-treated patients with no preexisting renal disease experienced dose-dependent mild, non-progressive increases in serum creatinine and proteinuria. Preexisting renal disease and concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in adult and pediatric patients. Acute illnesses associated with volume depletion and overchelation may increase the risk of acute kidney injury in pediatric patients. In pediatric patients, small decreases in eGFR can result in increases in deferasirox exposure, particularly in younger patients with body surface area typical of patients less than age 7 years. This can lead to a cycle of worsening renal function and further increases in deferasirox exposure, unless the dose is reduced or interrupted. Renal tubular toxicity, including acquired Fanconi syndrome, has been reported in patients treated with deferasirox, most commonly in pediatric patients with beta\u2011thalassemia and serum ferritin levels less than 1,500 mcg/L [see\u00a0Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 ), Use in\u00a0Specific Populations ( 8.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Evaluate renal glomerular and tubular function before initiating therapy or increasing the dose. Use prediction equations validated for use in adult and pediatric patients to estimate GFR. Obtain serum electrolytes and urinalysis in all patients to evaluate renal tubular function [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 )]. Monitor all patients for changes in eGFR and for renal tubular toxicity weekly during the first month after initiation or modification of therapy and at least monthly thereafter.\u00a0Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of renal tubular function and/or as clinically indicated. Monitor serum ferritin monthly to evaluate for overchelation. Use the minimum dose to establish and maintain a low iron burden. Monitor renal function more frequently in patients with preexisting renal disease or decreased renal function. In pediatric patients, interrupt deferasirox during acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor renal function more frequently. Promptly correct fluid deficits to prevent renal injury. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.2 Hepatic Toxicity and Failure Deferasirox can cause hepatic injury, fatal in some patients. In Study 1, 4 patients (1.3%) discontinued deferasirox because of hepatic toxicity (drug-induced hepatitis in 2 patients and increased serum transaminases in 2 additional patients). Hepatic toxicity appears to be more common in patients greater than 55 years of age. Hepatic failure was more common in patients with significant comorbidities, including liver cirrhosis and multi-organ failure [see Adverse Reactions ( . Acute liver injury and failure, including fatal outcomes, have occurred in pediatric deferasirox-treated patients. Liver failure occurred in association with acute kidney injury in pediatric patients at risk for overchelation during a volume depleting event. Interrupt deferasirox therapy when acute liver injury or acute kidney injury is suspected and during volume depletion. Monitor liver and renal function more frequently in pediatric patients who are receiving deferasirox in the 20\u00a0mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day range and when iron burden is approaching normal. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden 6.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Measure transaminases\u00a0[aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT)] and bilirubin in all patients before the initiation of treatment, and every 2 weeks during the first month and at least monthly thereafter. Consider dose modifications or interruption of treatment for severe or persistent elevations. Avoid the use of deferasirox in patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Reduce the starting dose in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( . Patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment may be at higher risk for hepatic toxicity. 2.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] 5.3 Gastrointestinal (GI) Ulceration, Hemorrhage, and Perforation GI hemorrhage, including deaths, has been reported in deferasirox-treated patients, especially in elderly patients who\u00a0had advanced hematologic malignancies and/or low platelet counts. Nonfatal upper GI irritation, ulceration and hemorrhage have been reported in patients, including children and adolescents, receiving deferasirox [see Adverse Reactions ( . Monitor for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and hemorrhage during deferasirox therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse\u00a0reaction is suspected. The risk of GI hemorrhage may be increased when administering deferasirox in combination with drugs that have ulcerogenic or hemorrhagic potential, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, oral bisphosphonates, or anticoagulants. There have been reports of ulcers complicated with GI perforation (including fatal outcome) 6.1 )] [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.4 Bone Marrow Suppression Neutropenia, agranulocytosis, worsening anemia, and thrombocytopenia, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated with deferasirox. Preexisting hematologic disorders may increase this risk. Monitor blood counts in all patients. Interrupt treatment with deferasirox in patients who develop cytopenias until the cause of the cytopenia has been determined. Deferasirox is contraindicated in patients with platelet counts below 50 x 10 9 /L. 5.5 Age-Related Risk of Toxicity Elderly Patients Deferasirox has been associated with serious and fatal adverse reactions in the postmarketing setting among adults, predominantly in elderly patients. Monitor elderly patients treated with deferasirox more frequently for toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Pediatric Patients Deferasirox has been associated with serious and fatal adverse reactions in pediatric patients in the postmarketing setting. These events were frequently associated with volume depletion or with continued deferasirox doses in the 20\u00a0mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day range when body iron burden was approaching or in the normal range. Interrupt deferasirox in patients with volume depletion, and resume deferasirox when renal function and fluid volume have normalized. Monitor liver and renal function more frequently during volume depletion and in patients receiving deferasirox in the 20\u00a0mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day range when iron burden is approaching the normal range. Use the minimum effective dose to achieve and maintain a low iron burden [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.6 Overchelation For patients with transfusional iron overload, measure serum ferritin monthly to assess\u00a0the patient\u2019s response to therapy and minimize the risk of overchelation. An analysis of pediatric patients treated with deferasirox in pooled clinical trials (n = 158) found a higher rate of renal adverse\u00a0reactions among patients receiving doses greater than 25 mg/kg/day while their serum ferritin values were less than 1,000 mcg/L. Consider dose reduction or closer monitoring of renal and hepatic function, and serum ferritin levels during these periods. Use the minimum effective dose to maintain a low-iron burden [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] If the serum ferritin falls below 1,000 mcg/L at 2 consecutive visits, consider dose reduction, especially if the dose is greater than 25 mg/kg/day [see Adverse Reactions ( . If the serum ferritin falls below 500 mcg/L, interrupt therapy with deferasirox and continue monthly monitoring. Evaluate the need for ongoing chelation for patients whose conditions do not require regular blood transfusions. Use the minimum effective dose to maintain iron burden in the target range. Continued administration of deferasirox in the 20 mg/kg/day to 40 mg/kg/day range when the body iron burden is approaching or within the normal range has resulted in life-threatening adverse\u00a0reactions 6.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 )] For patients with NTDT, measure LIC by liver biopsy or by using an FDA-cleared or approved method for monitoring patients receiving deferasirox therapy every 6\u00a0months on treatment. Interrupt deferasirox administration when the LIC is less than 3 mg Fe/g dw. Measure serum ferritin monthly, and if the serum ferritin falls below 300\u00a0mcg/L, interrupt deferasirox and obtain a confirmatory LIC [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] 5.7 Hypersensitivity Deferasirox may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions (such as anaphylaxis and angioedema), with the onset of the reaction usually occurring within the first month of treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( . If reactions are severe, discontinue deferasirox and institute appropriate medical intervention. Deferasirox is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to deferasirox products and should not be reintroduced in patients who have experienced previous hypersensitivity reactions on deferasirox products due to the risk of anaphylactic shock. 6.2 )] 5.8 Severe Skin Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which could be life-threatening or fatal have been reported during deferasirox therapy [see Adverse Reactions ( . Cases of erythema multiforme have been observed. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of severe skin reactions, and closely monitor. If any severe skin reactions are suspected, discontinue deferasirox immediately and do not reintroduce deferasirox therapy. 6.1 , 6.2 )] 5.9 Skin Rash Rashes may occur during deferasirox treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( . For rashes of mild to moderate severity, deferasirox may be continued without dose adjustment, since the rash often resolves spontaneously. In severe cases, interrupt treatment with deferasirox. Reintroduction at a lower dose with escalation may be considered after resolution of the rash. 6.1 )] 5.10 Auditory and Ocular Abnormalities Auditory disturbances (high frequency hearing loss, decreased hearing), and ocular disturbances (lens opacities, cataracts, elevations in intraocular pressure, and retinal disorders) were reported at a frequency of less than 1% with deferasirox therapy in the clinical studies. The frequency of auditory adverse\u00a0reactions was increased among pediatric patients who received deferasirox doses greater than 25 mg/kg/day when serum ferritin was less than 1,000 mcg/L [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.6 )] Perform auditory and ophthalmic testing (including slit-lamp examinations and dilated fundoscopy) before starting deferasirox treatment and thereafter at regular intervals (every 12 months). If disturbances are noted, monitor more frequently. Consider dose reduction or interruption.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are also discussed in other sections of the labeling: Acute Kidney Injury, Including Acute Renal Failure Requiring Dialysis, and Renal Tubular Toxicity Including Fanconi Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.6 )] Hepatic Toxicity and Failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.6 )] GI Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Bone Marrow Suppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Severe Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Skin Rash [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Auditory and Ocular Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] In patients with transfusional iron overload, the most frequently occurring (greater than 5%) adverse reactions are diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rashes, and increases in serum creatinine. In deferasirox\u2011treated patients with NTDT syndromes, the most frequently occurring (greater than 5%) adverse reactions are diarrhea, rash, and nausea.

Transfusional Iron Overload A total of 700 adult and pediatric patients were treated with deferasirox for 48 weeks in premarketing studies. These included 469 patients with beta-thalassemia, 99 with rare anemias, and 132 with sickle cell disease. Of these patients, 45% were male, 70% were Caucasian, and 292 patients were less than 16 years of age. In the sickle cell disease population, 89% of patients were black. Median treatment duration among the sickle cell patients was 51 weeks. Of the 700 patients treated, 469 (403 beta-thalassemia and 66 rare anemias) were entered into extensions of the original clinical protocols. In ongoing extension studies, median durations of treatment were 88 weeks to 205 weeks. Six hundred twenty-seven (627) patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were enrolled across 5 uncontrolled trials. These studies varied in duration from 1 year to 5 years. The discontinuation rate across studies in the first year was 46% (adverse events 20%, withdrawal of consent 10%, death 8%, other 4%, lab abnormalities 3%, and lack of efficacy 1%). Among 47 patients enrolled in the study of 5-year duration, 10 remained on deferasirox at the completion of the study. Table 1 displays adverse reactions occurring in greater than 5% of deferasirox-treated beta\u2011thalassemia patients (Study 1), sickle cell disease patients (Study 3), and patients with MDS (MDS pool). Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, and increases in serum creatinine were the most frequent adverse reactions reported with a suspected relationship to deferasirox. Gastrointestinal symptoms, increases in serum creatinine, and skin rash were dose related. Table 1.

See also Table 2. In Study 1, a total of 113 (38%) patients treated with deferasirox had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 separate occasions (Table 2) and 25 (8%) patients required dose reductions. Increases in serum creatinine appeared to be dose related [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In this study, 17 (6%) patients treated with deferasirox developed elevations in serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)/ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at 2 consecutive visits. Of these, 2 patients had liver biopsy proven drug-induced hepatitis and both discontinued deferasirox therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. An additional 2 patients, who did not have elevations in SGPT/ALT greater than 5 times the ULN, discontinued deferasirox because of increased SGPT/ALT. Increases in transaminases did not appear to be dose related. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuations included abnormal liver function tests (2 patients) and drug-induced hepatitis (2 patients), skin rash, glycosuria/proteinuria, Henoch Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, hyperactivity/insomnia, drug fever, and cataract (1 patient each). In Study 3, a total of 48 (36%) patients treated with deferasirox had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 separate occasions (Table 2) [see Warnings and Precautions ( . Of the patients who experienced creatinine increases in Study 3, 8 deferasirox-treated patients required dose reductions. In this study, 5 patients in the deferasirox group developed elevations in SGPT/ALT levels greater than 5 times the ULN at 2 consecutive visits and 1 patient subsequently had deferasirox permanently discontinued. Four additional patients discontinued deferasirox due to adverse reactions with a suspected relationship to study drug, including diarrhea, pancreatitis associated with gallstones, atypical tuberculosis, and skin rash. 5.1 )] In the MDS pool, in the first year, a total of 229 (37%) patients treated with deferasirox had increases in serum creatinine greater than 33% above baseline on 2 consecutive occasions (Table 2) and 8 (3.5%) patients permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( .

Non-Transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia Syndromes In Study 5, 110 patients with NTDT received 1 year of treatment with deferasirox 5 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day and 56 patients received placebo in a double-blind, randomized trial. In Study 6, 130 of the patients who completed Study 5 were treated with open-label deferasirox at 5 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day, or 20 mg/kg/day (depending on the baseline LIC) for 1 year [see Clinical Studies ( . n Study 7, 134 patients with NTDT of 10 years of age or older with iron overload, received deferasirox for up to 5 years, at a starting dose of 10 mg/kg/day followed by dose adjustment at Week 4, and then approximately every 6 months thereafter based on LIC levels.

In Study 5, 1 patient in the placebo 10 mg/kg/day group experienced an ALT increase to greater than 5 times ULN and greater than 2 times baseline (Table 4). Three deferasirox-treated patients (all in the 10 mg/kg/day group) had 2 consecutive serum creatinine level increases greater than 33% from baseline and greater than ULN. Serum creatinine returned to normal in all 3 patients (in 1 spontaneously and in the other 2 after drug interruption). Two additional cases of ALT increase and 2 additional cases of serum creatinine increase were observed in the 1-year extension of Study 5.

Proteinuria In clinical studies, urine protein was measured monthly. Intermittent proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 0.6 mg/mg) occurred in 18.6% of deferasirox-treated patients compared to 7.2% of deferoxamine-treated patients in Study 1 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Other Adverse Reactions In the population of more than 5,000 patients with transfusional iron overload who have been treated with deferasirox during clinical trials, adverse reactions occurring in 0.1% to 1% of patients included gastritis, edema, sleep disorder, pigmentation disorder, dizziness, anxiety, maculopathy, cholelithiasis, pyrexia, fatigue, laryngeal pain, cataract, hearing loss, GI hemorrhage, gastric ulcer (including multiple ulcers), duodenal ulcer, renal tubular disorder (Fanconi Syndrome), and acute pancreatitis (with and without underlying biliary conditions). Adverse reactions occurring in 0.01% to 0.1% of patients included optic neuritis, esophagitis, erythema multiforme, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Adverse reactions, which most frequently led to dose interruption or dose adjustment during clinical trials were rash, GI disorders, infections, increased serum creatinine, and increased serum transaminases. Pooled Analysis of Pediatric Clinical Trial Data A nested case control analysis was conducted within a deferasirox tablets for oral suspension pediatric pooled clinical trial dataset to evaluate the effects of dose and serum ferritin level, separately and combined, on kidney function. Among 1,213 children (aged 2 years to 15 years) with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, 162 cases of acute kidney injury (eGFR \u2264 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) and 621 matched-controls with normal kidney function (eGFR \u2265 120 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) were identified. The primary findings were: - A 26% increased risk of acute kidney injury was observed with each 5 mg/kg increase in daily deferasirox dosage starting at 20 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.48). - A 25% increased risk for acute kidney injury was observed with each 250 mcg/L decrease in serum ferritin starting at 1,250 mcg/L (95% CI: 1.01-1.56). - Among pediatric patients with a serum ferritin < 1,000 mcg/L, those who received deferasirox dosage > 30 mg/kg/day, compared to those who received lower dosages, had a higher risk for acute kidney injury (Odds ratio (OR) = 4.47, 95% CI: 1.25-15.95), consistent with overchelation. In addition, a cohort based analysis of ARs was conducted in the deferasirox tablets for oral suspension pediatric pooled clinical trial data. Pediatric patients who received deferasirox dose > 25 mg/kg/day when their serum ferritin was < 1,000 mcg/L (n = 158) had a 6-fold greater rate of renal adverse reactions (incidence rate ration (IRR) = 6.00, 95% CI: 1.75-21.36) and a 2-fold greater rate of dose interruptions (IRR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.33-3.17) compared to the time-period prior to meeting these simultaneous criteria. Adverse reaction of special interest (cytopenia, renal, hearing, and GI disorders) occurred 1.9\u2011fold more frequently when these simultaneous criteria were met, compared to preceding time\u2011periods (IRR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.05-3.48) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported during post-approval use of deferasirox in the transfusional-iron overload setting. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, in which patients may have received concomitant medication, it is not always possible to reliably estimate frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure . Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), hypersensitivity vasculitis, urticaria, alopecia, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction and angioedema) Renal and Urinary Disorders: acute renal failure, tubulointerstitial nephritis Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatic failure Gastrointestinal Disorders: GI perforation Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: worsening anemia 5-Year Pediatric Registry In a 5-year observational study, 267 pediatric patients 2 years to < 6 years of age (at enrollment) with transfusional hemosiderosis received deferasirox. Of the 242 patients who had pre- and post\u2011baseline eGFR measurements, 116 (48%) patients had a decrease in eGFR of \u2265 33% observed at least once. Twenty-one (18%) of these 116 patients with decreased eGFR had a dose interruption, and 15 (13%) of these 116 patients had a dose decrease within 30 days. Adverse\u00a0reactions leading to permanent discontinuation from the study included liver injury (n = 11), renal tubular disorder (n = 1), proteinuria (n = 1), hematuria (n = 1), upper GI hemorrhage (n = 1), vomiting (n = 2), abdominal pain (n = 1), and hypokalemia (n = 1).",
