    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE AVYCAZ is a combination\u00a0of ceftazidime, a cephalosporin, and avibactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor,\u00a0indicated for\u00a0the treatment of the following infections caused by designated susceptible\u00a0Gram-negative microorganisms in\u00a0adult and pediatric patients (at least 31 weeks gestational age): Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI), used in combination with metronidazole ( ) 1.1 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis\u00a0( ) 1.2 Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP) ( ) 1.3 To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AVYCAZ and other antibacterial drugs, AVYCAZ should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by\u00a0susceptible\u00a0bacteria.\u00a0( ) 1.4 1. 1 Complicated Intra- a bdominal Infections (cIAI) AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam) in combination with metronidazole, is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in adult and pediatric patients\u00a0(at least 31 weeks gestational age) caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii complex, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . 1. 2 Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam) is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis in adult and pediatric patients\u00a0(at least 31 weeks gestational age)\u00a0caused by the following susceptible\u00a0gram-negative microorganisms: Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii complex, Proteus mirabilis , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . 1.3 Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP) AVYCAZ (ceftazidime and avibactam) is indicated for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in adult and pediatric patients\u00a0(at least 31 weeks gestational age)\u00a0caused by the following susceptible gram-negative microorganisms: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae . 1. 4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of AVYCAZ and other antibacterial drugs, AVYCAZ should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .",

( ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity R eactions : Includes anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions. Cross\u00a0sensitivity may occur in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction occurs, discontinue AVYCAZ.\u00a0( ) 5.2 Clostrid io i des difficile -associated D iarrhea (CDAD) : CDAD\u00a0has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including AVYCAZ. Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( ) 5.3 C entral Nervous System Reactions : Seizures and other neurologic events may occur, especially in patients with renal impairment. Adjust dose in patients with renal impairment. ( ) 5.4 5.1 Decreased Clinical Response in Adult cIAI Patients with Baseline Creatinine Clearance of 30 to Less Than or Equal to 50 mL/min In\u00a0a Phase 3 cIAI trial in adult patients, clinical cure rates were lower in a\u00a0subgroup of patients with baseline CrCl\u00a0of 30\u00a0to less than or equal to 50 mL/min\u00a0compared to those with CrCl\u00a0greater than\u00a050 mL/min (Table 10).\u00a0The reduction in clinical cure rates was more marked in patients\u00a0treated with AVYCAZ plus metronidazole compared to meropenem-treated patients. Within this subgroup, patients treated with AVYCAZ received a 33% lower daily dose than is currently recommended for patients with CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min. The\u00a0decreased clinical response was not observed for patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline (CrCl of 30 to less than or equal to 50\u00a0mL/min) in the Phase 3 cUTI trials\u00a0or\u00a0the Phase 3 HABP/VABP trial. Monitor CrCl at least daily in adult and pediatric patients with changing renal function and adjust the dosage of AVYCAZ accordingly [ see Dosage and Administration ( , 2.2 2.3 ) , and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . Table 10. Clinical Cure Rate at Test of Cure in a Phase 3 cIAI Trial, by Baseline Renal Function \u2013 mMITT Population a AVYCAZ + Metronidazole % (n/N) Meropenem % (n/N) Normal function / mild impairment (CrCl\u00a0greater than 50 mL/min) 85% (322/379) 86% (321/373) Moderate impairment (CrCl 30 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min) 45% (14/31) 74% (26/35) a Microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mMITT) population included patients who had at least one bacterial pathogen at baseline and received at least one dose of study drug. 5. 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions and serious skin reactions have been reported in patients receiving beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Before therapy with AVYCAZ is instituted, careful inquiry about previous hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins, penicillins, or carbapenems should be made.\u00a0Exercise caution if this product is to be given to a penicillin or other beta-lactam-allergic patient because cross sensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been established. Discontinue the drug if an allergic reaction to AVYCAZ occurs. 5. 3 Clostridi oides difficile- associated Diarrhea Clostridi oides difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial drugs, including AVYCAZ, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial drugs alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile . C.\u00a0difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin\u00a0producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial drugs. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, antibacterial drugs\u00a0not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued.\u00a0Manage fluid and electrolyte levels as appropriate, supplement protein intake, monitor antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and institute surgical evaluation as clinically indicated. 5. 4 Central Nervous System Reactions Seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, and myoclonia have been reported in patients treated with ceftazidime, particularly in the setting of renal impairment. Adjust dosing based on creatinine clearance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] . 5. 5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing AVYCAZ in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria [see Indications and Usage ( 1.4 )] .",

Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients AVYCAZ was evaluated in six active-controlled clinical trials in patients with cIAI, cUTI, including pyelonephritis, or HABP/VABP. These trials included two Phase 2 trials, one in cIAI and one in cUTI, as well as\u00a0four Phase 3 trials, one in cIAI, one in cUTI (Trial 1), one in cIAI or cUTI due to ceftazidime non-susceptible pathogens (Trial 2), and one in HABP/VABP. Data from cUTI Trial 1 served as the primary dataset for AVYCAZ safety findings in cUTI as there was a single comparator. cUTI Trial 2 had an open-label design as well as multiple comparator regimens which prevented pooling but provided supportive information.\u00a0The six clinical trials included a total of 1809\u00a0adult patients treated with AVYCAZ\u00a0and 1809\u00a0patients treated with comparators. Complicated Intra- a bdominal Infections The Phase 3 cIAI trial included 529 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams\u00a0and avibactam 0.5 grams) administered intravenously\u00a0over 120 minutes every 8\u00a0hours plus 0.5 grams\u00a0metronidazole administered intravenously\u00a0over 60 minutes every 8 hours and 529 patients treated with meropenem. The median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 50 years (range\u00a018 to\u00a090\u00a0years) and 22.5% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly male (62%) and Caucasian (76.6%). Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2.6% (14/529) of patients receiving AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and 1.3% (7/529) of patients receiving meropenem. Adverse reactions occurring at 5% or greater in patients receiving AVYCAZ plus metronidazole were diarrhea,\u00a0nausea, and vomiting. Table 11\u00a0lists adverse reactions occurring in 1% or more of patients receiving AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and with incidences greater than the comparator in the Phase 3 cIAI clinical trial. Table 11.

Among a subgroup of patients with baseline CrCl\u00a030 to less than or equal to 50 mL/min,\u00a0death occurred in 19.5% (8/41) of patients who received AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and in 7.0% (3/43) of patients who received meropenem.\u00a0Within this subgroup,\u00a0patients treated with AVYCAZ received a 33% lower daily dose than is currently recommended for patients with CrCl 30 to less than or equal\u00a0to 50 mL/min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ]. In patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (baseline CrCl\u00a0greater than 50 mL/min),\u00a0death occurred in 1.0% (5/485) of patients who received AVYCAZ plus metronidazole and in 1.0% (5/484) of patients who received meropenem. The causes of death varied and contributing factors included progression of underlying infection, baseline pathogens isolated that were unlikely to respond to the study drug, and delayed surgical intervention. Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis The Phase 3 cUTI Trial 1 included 511 adult patients treated with AVYCAZ 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 grams and avibactam 0.5 grams) administered intravenously\u00a0over 120 minutes every 8 hours\u00a0and 509 patients treated with doripenem; in some patients parenteral therapy\u00a0was followed by a switch to an oral antimicrobial agent [ s ee Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. Median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 54 years (range 18 to 89 years) and 30.7% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly female (68.3%) and Caucasian (82.4%). Patients with CrCl\u00a0less than\u00a030 mL/min were excluded. There were no deaths in Trial 1. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (7/511) of patients receiving AVYCAZ and 1.2% (6/509) of patients receiving doripenem. The most common adverse reactions occurring in 3% of cUTI patients treated with AVYCAZ were nausea and diarrhea. Table 12\u00a0lists adverse reactions occurring in 1% or more of patients receiving AVYCAZ and with incidences greater than the comparator in Trial 1. Table 12.

The median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 66 years (range\u00a018 to 89\u00a0years) and 54.1% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly male (74.5%) and Asian (56.2%). Death occurred in 9.6% (42/\u00a0436)\u00a0of patients who received AVYCAZ\u00a0and in 8.3% (36/434) of patients who received meropenem. Treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.7% (16/436) of patients receiving AVYCAZ and 3% (13/434)\u00a0of patients receiving meropenem. Adverse reactions occurring at 5% or greater in patients receiving AVYCAZ were diarrhea\u00a0and\u00a0vomiting.

Less Common Adverse Reactions with AVYCAZ The following selected adverse reactions were reported in AVYCAZ-treated patients\u00a0at a rate of less than 1% in the Phase 3 trials and are not described elsewhere in the labeling. Blood and lymphatic disorders \u2013 Thrombocytopenia, Thrombocytosis,\u00a0Leukopenia General disorders and administration site conditions \u2013 Injection site phlebitis Infections and infestations \u2013 Candidiasis Investigations \u2013 Increased aspartate aminotransferase,\u00a0Increased alanine aminotransferase, Increased gamma-glutamyl\u00a0transferase Metabolism and nutrition disorders \u2013 Hypokalemia Nervous system disorders \u2013 Dysgeusia Renal and urinary disorders \u2013 Acute kidney injury,\u00a0Renal impairment, Nephrolithiasis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \u2013 Rash,\u00a0Rash maculo-papular, Urticaria Psychiatric disorders \u2013 Anxiety Adverse Reactions with Ceftazidime Additionally, adverse reactions reported with ceftazidime alone that were not reported in AVYCAZ-treated patients in the Phase 3 trials are listed below: Blood and lymphatic disorders \u2013 Agranulocytosis, Hemolytic anemia, Lymphocytosis, Neutropenia, Eosinophilia General disorders and administration site conditions \u2013\u00a0Infusion site inflammation, Injection site hematoma, Injection site thrombosis Hepatobiliary disorders \u2013 Jaundice Investigations \u2013 Increased blood lactate dehydrogenase, Prolonged prothrombin time Nervous system disorders \u2013 Paresthesia, seizures, encephalopathy, coma, asterixis, neuromuscular excitability, myoclonia Renal and urinary disorders \u2013 Tubulointerstitial nephritis Reproductive and breast disorders \u2013 Vaginal inflammation Hypersensitivity Reactions \u2013 Anaphylaxis, Angioedema, Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients Pediatric Patients A ged 3 months to less than 18 years AVYCAZ was evaluated in 128 pediatric patients aged 3 months to < 18 years in two single-blind, randomized, active-controlled clinical trials, one in patients with cUTI and the other in patients with cIAI. Safety data from the two studies were pooled. The AVYCAZ dosing regimen was the same in both of these\u00a0trials [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] with a mean treatment duration of 6 days, and a maximum of 14 days. The regimen was selected to result in pediatric drug exposure comparable to that of adults, and in the cIAI trial, metronidazole was administered concurrently with AVYCAZ. Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive AVYCAZ or comparator, which was meropenem or cefepime in the cIAI and cUTI trials, respectively. The median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 8.6 years, and in the comparator group 7.4 years. The majority of patients treated with AVYCAZ were female (57%) and Caucasian (80%). An open-label single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety trial was conducted in pediatric patients with HABP/VABP and enrolled four patients aged 11.6 months to 9.4 years [see Clinical Pharmacology 12.3 ] . There were no deaths reported in the trials of cUTI, cIAI, and HABP/VABP in pediatric\u00a0patients aged 3 months and older. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions in the pediatric cUTI and cIAI trials occurred in 2.3% (3/128) of patients receiving AVYCAZ and 0/50 of patients receiving comparator drugs. The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 3% of pediatric patients aged 3 months to < 18 years\u00a0treated with AVYCAZ were vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and infusion site phlebitis. Pediatric Patients less than 3 months of Age AVYCAZ was also evaluated in a trial enrolling 46 pediatric patients less than three months of age as follows: infants > 28 days to < 3 months (N=17), term neonates from birth to 28 days, (N=13), pre-term neonates from birth (gestational age \u2265 31 weeks) to 28 days (N=16). The median age of patients treated with AVYCAZ was 24 days. In this single-arm trial, 25 patients with a suspected or confirmed bacterial infection received a single-dose of AVYCAZ and 21 patients with suspected or confirmed serious gram-negative infections received multiple doses of AVYCAZ [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] .  The demographics of patients treated with AVYCAZ were female (54%), male (46%); racial groups of White (78%), Asian (11%), Black or African American (9%); ethnicities of Not Hispanic or Latino (91.3%); Hispanic or Latino (4.3%). In patients treated with multiple doses of AVYCAZ [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] , the mean treatment duration was 6 days and maximum treatment duration was 12 days. There was one death reported in the trial for\u00a0pediatric patients less than 3 months of age.  There were no treatment discontinuations due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 3% of pediatric patients less than 3 months of age were vomiting and increased transaminases. The safety profile of AVYCAZ in pediatric patients was similar to adults with cIAI, cUTI, and HABP/VABP treated with AVYCAZ. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been identified during post approval use of ceftazidime (a component of AVYCAZ), or other cephalosporin-class antibacterial drugs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Colitis, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, hemorrhage, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, prolonged prothrombin time, false-positive test for urinary glucose. Acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction may occur as part of an allergic reaction.",
