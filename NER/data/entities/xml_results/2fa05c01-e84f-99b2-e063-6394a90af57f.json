The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses or images ( obsessions ) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors ( compulsions ) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable. The efficacy of fluvoxamine maleate tablets was established in four trials in outpatients with OCD: two 10-week trials in adults, one 10-week trial in pediatric patients ( ages 8 years to 17 years ) , and one maintenance trial in adults [see .

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Suicidality: Monitor for clinical worsening and suicide risk ( 5.1 ) . Bipolar disorder: Screen for bipolar disorder ( 5.1 ) . Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets, both when taken alone, but especially when co-administered with other serotonergic agents. If such symptoms occur, discontinue fluvoxamine maleate tablets and serotonergic agents and initiate supportive treatment. If concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases ( 5.2 ) . Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants ( 5.3 ) . Other potentially important drug interactions. Benzodiazepines: Use with caution. Co-administration with diazepam is generally not advisable ( 5.8 ) . Clozapine: Clozapine levels may be increased and produce orthostatic hypotension or seizures ( 5.8 ) . Methadone: Co-administration may produce opioid intoxication. Discontinuation of fluvoxamine may produce opioid withdrawal ( 5.8 ) . Mexiletine: Monitor serum mexiletine levels ( 5.8 ) . Ramelteon: Should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine ( 5.8 ) . Theophylline: Clearance decreased; reduce theophylline dose by one-third ( 5.8 ) . Warfarin: Plasma concentrations increased and prothrombin times prolonged; monitor prothrombin time and adjust warfarin dose accordingly ( 5.8 ) . Other Drugs Affecting Hemostasis: Increased risk of bleeding with concomitant use of NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs affecting coagulation ( 5.8 , 5.10 ) [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) ] Discontinuation: Symptoms associated with discontinuation have been reported ( 5.9 ) . Abrupt discontinuation not recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ] . Activation of mania/hypomania has occurred ( 5.11 ) . Seizures: Avoid administering fluvoxamine in patients with unstable epilepsy; monitor patients with controlled epilepsy; discontinue treatment if seizures occur or frequency increases ( 5.12 ) . Hyponatremia: May occur with SSRIs and SNRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets. The elderly may be at increased risk. Consider discontinuing in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia ( 5.13 ) . Concomitant Illness: Use caution in patients with diseases or conditions that affect hemodynamic responses or metabolism ( 5.14 ) . Patients with impaired liver function may require a lower starting dose and slower titration ( 2.3 ) . Sexual Dysfunction: Fluvoxamine maleate tablets may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction ( 5.16 ) . 5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior ( suicidality ) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs ( SSRIs and others ) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior ( suicidality ) in children, adolescents, and young adults ( ages 18 years to 24 years ) with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24 years; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 years and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4.400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials ( median duration of 2 months ) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77.000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences ( drug vs placebo ) , however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences ( drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1.000 patients treated ) are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Drug-Placebo Differences in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1.000 Patients Treated Age Range Increases Compared to Placebo less than 18 14 Additional cases 18 to 24 5 Additional cases Age Range Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 Fewer case \u2265 65 6 Fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about the drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e. , beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia ( psychomotor restlessness ) , hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. If the decision has been made to discontinue treatment, medication should be tapered, as rapidly as is feasible, but with recognition that abrupt discontinuation can be associated with certain symptoms and risks [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ] Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed ( though not established in controlled trials ) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that fluvoxamine maleate tablets are not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets, alone but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs ( including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort ) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin ( in particular MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue ) . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes ( e.g. , agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma ) , autonomic instability ( e.g. , tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular aberrations ( e.g. , tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination ) , seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms ( e.g. , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ) . Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. The concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Fluvoxamine maleate tablets should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes ( such as oral tablets or local tissue injection ) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking fluvoxamine maleate tablets. Fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 , 2.5 ) ] If concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets with other serotonergic drugs, including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines and St. John\u2019s Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with fluvoxamine maleate tablets and any concomitant serotonergic agents, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. 5.3 Angle Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including fluvoxamine maleate tablets may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who do not have a patent iridectomy. 5.4 Potential Thioridazine Interaction The effect of fluvoxamine ( 25 mg b.i.d. for one week ) on thioridazine steady-state concentrations was evaluated in 10 male inpatients with schizophrenia. Concentrations of thioridazine and its two active metabolites, mesoridazine and sulforidazine, increased three-fold following co-administration of fluvoxamine. Thioridazine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. It is likely that this experience underestimates the degree of risk that might occur with higher doses of thioridazine. Moreover, the effect of fluvoxamine may be even more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses. Therefore, fluvoxamine and thioridazine should not be co-administered [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) ] 5.5 Potential Tizanidine Interaction Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1 A2 and tizanidine is a CYP1 A2 substrate. The effect of fluvoxamine ( 100 mg daily for 4 days ) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single 4 mg dose of tizanidine has been studied in 10 healthy male subjects. Tizanidine C max was increased approximately 12-fold ( range 5-fold to 32-fold ) , elimination half-life was increased by almost 3-fold, and AUC increased 33-fold ( range 14-fold to 103-fold ) . The mean maximal effect on blood pressure was a 35 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure, a 20 mm Hg decrease in diastolic blood pressure, and a 4 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Drowsiness was significantly increased and performance on the psychomotor task was significantly impaired. Fluvoxamine and tizanidine should not be used together [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) ] 5.6 Potential Pimozide Interaction Pimozide is metabolized by the cytochrome P4503 A4 isoenzyme, and it has been demonstrated that ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3 A4, blocks the metabolism of this drug, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of parent drug. An increased plasma concentration of pimozide causes QT prolongation and has been associated with torsades de pointes-type ventricular tachycardia, sometimes fatal. As noted below, a substantial pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed for fluvoxamine in combination with alprazolam, a drug that is known to be metabolized by CYP3 A4. Although it has not been definitively demonstrated that fluvoxamine is a potent CYP3 A4 inhibitor, it is likely to be, given the substantial interaction of fluvoxamine with alprazolam. Consequently, it is recommended that fluvoxamine not be used in combination with pimozide [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) ] 5.7 Potential Alosetron Interaction Because alosetron is metabolized by a variety of hepatic CYP drug metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance of alosetron. Fluvoxamine is a known potent inhibitor of CYP1 A2 and also inhibits CYP3 A4, CYP2 C9, and CYP2 C19. In a pharmacokinetic study, 40 healthy female subjects received fluvoxamine in escalating doses from 50 mg to 200 mg a day for 16 days, with co-administration of alosetron 1 mg on the last day. Fluvoxamine increased mean alosetron plasma concentration ( AUC ) approximately 6-fold and prolonged the half-life by approximately 3-fold [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) and Lotronex \u00ae ( alosetron ) package insert] 5.8 Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions Benzodiazepines metabolized by hepatic oxidation ( e.g. , alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam, etc. ) should be used with caution because the clearance of these drugs is likely to be reduced by fluvoxamine. The clearance of benzodiazepines metabolized by glucuronidation ( e.g. , lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam ) is unlikely to be affected by fluvoxamine. Benzodiazepines: When fluvoxamine maleate tablets ( 100 mg q.d. ) and alprazolam ( 1 mg q.i.d. ) were co-administered to steady state, plasma concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters ( AUC, C Alprazolam: max , T\u00bd ) of alprazolam were approximately twice those observed when alprazolam was administered alone; oral clearance was reduced by about 50% . The elevated plasma alprazolam concentrations resulted in decreased psychomotor performance and memory. This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100 mg to 300 mg. If alprazolam is co-administered with fluvoxamine maleate tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets. The co-administration of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and diazepam is generally not advisable. Because fluvoxamine reduces the clearance of both diazepam and its active metabolite, N-desmethyldiazepam, there is a strong likelihood of substantial accumulation of both species during chronic co-administration. Diazepam: Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer fluvoxamine and diazepam is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking 150 mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of 10 mg of diazepam. In these subjects ( N = 8 ) , the clearance of diazepam was reduced by 65% and that of N-desmethyldiazepam to a level that was too low to measure over the course of the 2-week-long study. It is likely that this experience significantly underestimates the degree of accumulation that might occur with repeated diazepam administration. Moreover, as noted with alprazolam, the effect of fluvoxamine may even be more pronounced when it is administered at higher doses. Accordingly, diazepam and fluvoxamine should not ordinarily be co-administered. Elevated serum levels of clozapine have been reported in patients taking fluvoxamine maleate tablets and clozapine. Since clozapine-related seizures and orthostatic hypotension appear to be dose-related, the risk of these adverse events may be higher when fluvoxamine and clozapine are co-administered. Patients should be closely monitored when fluvoxamine maleate tablets and clozapine are used concurrently. Clozapine: Significantly increased methadone ( plasma level: dose ) ratios have been reported when fluvoxamine maleate tablets were administered to patients receiving maintenance methadone treatment, with symptoms of opioid intoxication in one patient. Opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported following fluvoxamine maleate tablets discontinuation in another patient. Methadone: The effect of steady-state fluvoxamine ( 50 mg b.i.d. for 7 days ) on the single dose pharmacokinetics of mexiletine ( 200 mg ) was evaluated in 6 healthy Japanese males. The clearance of mexiletine was reduced by 38% following co-administration with fluvoxamine compared to mexiletine alone. If fluvoxamine and mexiletine are co-administered, serum mexiletine levels should be monitored. Mexiletine: When fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily was administered for 3 days prior to single-dose co-administration of ramelteon 16 mg and fluvoxamine, the AUC for ramelteon increased approximately 190-fold and the C Ramelteon: max increased approximately 70-fold compared to ramelteon administered alone. Ramelteon should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine. The effect of steady-state fluvoxamine ( 50 mg b.i.d. ) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of theophylline ( 375 mg as 442 mg aminophylline ) was evaluated in 12 healthy non-smoking, male volunteers. The clearance of theophylline was decreased approximately 3-fold. Therefore, if theophylline is co-administered with fluvoxamine maleate tablets, its dose should be reduced to one-third of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentrations of theophylline should be monitored. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets. Theophylline: Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Thus, patients should be cautioned about the use of such drugs concurrently with fluvoxamine Warfarin and Other Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis ( NSAIDs, Aspirin, etc. ) : [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 ) ] When fluvoxamine maleate tablets ( 50 mg t.i.d. ) were administered concomitantly with warfarin for two weeks, warfarin plasma concentrations increased by 98% and prothrombin times were prolonged. Thus patients receiving oral anticoagulants and fluvoxamine maleate tablets should have their prothrombin time monitored and their anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly. No dosage adjustment is required for fluvoxamine maleate tablets. Warfarin: 5.9 Discontinuation of Treatment with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets During marketing of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and other SSRIs and SNRIs ( serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ) , there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances ( e.g. , paresthesias, such as electric shock sensations ) , anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with fluvoxamine maleate tablets. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may continue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ] 5.10 Abnormal Bleeding SSRIs and SNRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies ( case-control and cohort design ) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see . Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] . 5.11 Activation of Mania/Hypomania During pre-marketing studies involving primarily depressed patients, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated with fluvoxamine. In a ten-week pediatric OCD study, 2 out of 57 patients ( 4% ) treated with fluvoxamine experienced manic reactions, compared to none of 63 placebo patients. Activation of mania/hypomania has also been reported in a small proportion of patients with major affective disorder who were treated with other marketed antidepressants. As with all antidepressants, fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. 5.12 Seizures During pre-marketing studies, seizures were reported in 0.2% of fluvoxamine-treated patients. Caution is recommended when the drug is administered to patients with a history of convulsive disorders. Fluvoxamine should be avoided in patients with unstable epilepsy and patients with controlled epilepsy should be carefully monitored. Treatment with fluvoxamine should be discontinued if seizures occur or if seizure frequency increases. 5.13 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ( SIADH ) . Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs [see . Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk. Discontinuation of fluvoxamine maleate tablets should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ] Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. 5.14 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Closely monitored clinical experience with fluvoxamine maleate tablets in patients with concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advised in administering fluvoxamine maleate tablets to patients with diseases or conditions that could affect hemodynamic responses or metabolism. Fluvoxamine maleate tablets have not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were systematically excluded from many clinical studies during the product's pre-marketing testing. Evaluation of the electrocardiograms for patients with depression or OCD who participated in pre-marketing studies revealed no differences between fluvoxamine and placebo in the emergence of clinically important ECG changes. In patients with liver dysfunction, fluvoxamine clearance was decreased by approximately 30% . Patients with liver dysfunction should begin with a low dose of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and increase it slowly with careful monitoring. Patients with Hepatic Impairment: 5.15 Laboratory Tests There are no specific laboratory tests recommended. 5.16 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including fluvoxamine maleate tablets, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 ) ] . It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history ( including timing of symptom onset ) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common reactions in controlled trials with adult OCD and depression patients ( incidence \u2265 5% and at least twice that for placebo ) were nausea, somnolence, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, dyspepsia, abnormal ejaculation, sweating, anorexia, tremor, and vomiting ( 6.2 ) . Using the above rule, the following events were also identified: anorgasmia, decreased libido, dry mouth, rhinitis, taste perversion, and urinary frequency in patients with OCD; and agitation, depression, dysmenorrhea, flatulence, hyperkinesia, and rash in pediatric patients with OCD. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bionpharma Inc. at 1-888-235-BION or 1-888-235-2466 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation Of the 1.087 OCD and depressed patients treated with fluvoxamine maleate tablets in controlled clinical trials in North America, 22% discontinued due to an adverse reaction. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in at least 2% of fluvoxamine maleate tablets-treated patients in these trials were: nausea ( 9% ) , insomnia ( 4% ) , somnolence ( 4% ) , headache ( 3% ) , and asthenia, vomiting, nervousness, agitation, and dizziness ( 2% each ) . 6.2 Incidence in Controlled Trials Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Controlled Clinical Trials Fluvoxamine maleate tablets have been studied in 10-week short-term controlled trials of OCD ( N = 320 ) and depression ( N = 1.350 ) . In general, adverse reaction rates were similar in the two data sets as well as in the pediatric OCD study. The most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and likely to be drug-related ( incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice that for placebo ) derived from Table 2 were: nausea, somnolence, insomnia, asthenia, nervousness, dyspepsia, abnormal ejaculation, sweating, anorexia, tremor, and vomiting . In a pool of two studies involving only patients with OCD, the following additional reactions were identified using the above rule: anorgasmia, decreased libido, dry mouth, rhinitis, taste perversion, and urinary frequency . In a study of pediatric patients with OCD, the following additional reactions were identified using the above rule: agitation, depression, dysmenorrhea, flatulence, hyperkinesia, and rash . Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 1% Table 2 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in adults at a frequency of 1% or more, and were more frequent than in the placebo group, among patients treated with fluvoxamine maleate tablets in two short-term placebo-controlled OCD trials ( 10 weeks ) and depression trials ( 6 weeks ) in which patients were dosed in a range of generally 100 mg/day to 300 mg/day. This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least one occurrence of a reaction at some time during their treatment. Reported adverse reactions were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology. The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those that prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to the side-effect incidence rate in the population studied. Table 2: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reaction Incidence Rates by Body System in Adult OCD and Depression Populations Combined Reactions for which fluvoxamine incidence was equal to or less than placebo are not listed in the table above.

Additionally, there was an approximate 25% decrease in nausea. The reactions in OCD studies with a two-fold increase in rate compared to reaction rates in OCD and depression studies were: asthenia, abnormal ejaculation ( mostly delayed ejaculation ) , anxiety, rhinitis, anorgasmia ( in males ) , depression, libido decreased, pharyngitis, agitation, impotence, myoclonus/twitch, thirst, weight loss, leg cramps, myalgia, and urinary retention . These reactions are listed in order of decreasing rates in the OCD trials. 6.3 Other Adverse Reactions in OCD Pediatric Population In pediatric patients ( N = 57 ) treated with fluvoxamine maleate tablets, the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies, as shown in Table 2. However, the following adverse reactions, not appearing in Table 2, were reported in two or more of the pediatric patients and were more frequent with fluvoxamine maleate tablets than with placebo: cough increase, dysmenorrhea, ecchymosis, emotional lability, epistaxis, hyperkinesia, manic reaction, rash, sinusitis, and weight decrease. 6.4 Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction with SSRIs Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder and with aging, they may also be a consequence of pharmacologic treatment. In particular, some evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , can cause such untoward sexual experiences. Reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate their actual incidence. Table 3 displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of patients taking fluvoxamine maleate tablets in placebo-controlled trials in depression and OCD. Table 3: Percentage of Patients Reporting Sexual Adverse Reactions in Adult Placebo-Controlled Trials in OCD and Depression Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets N = 892 Placebo N = 778 Abnormal Ejaculation Based on the number of male patients. 8% 1% Impotence 2% 1% Decreased Libido 2% 1% Anorgasmia 2% 0% There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with fluvoxamine treatment. Fluvoxamine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae and upon discontinuation of fluvoxamine. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. 6.5 Vital Sign Changes Comparisons of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and placebo groups in separate pools of short-term OCD and depression trials on ( 1 ) median change from baseline on various vital signs variables and on ( 2 ) incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially important changes from baseline on various vital signs variables revealed no important differences between fluvoxamine maleate tablets and placebo. 6.6 Laboratory Changes Comparisons of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and placebo groups in separate pools of short-term OCD and depression trials on ( 1 ) median change from baseline on various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables and on ( 2 ) incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially important changes from baseline on various serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis variables revealed no important differences between fluvoxamine maleate tablets and placebo. 6.7 ECG Changes Comparisons of fluvoxamine maleate tablets and placebo groups in separate pools of short-term OCD and depression trials on ( 1 ) mean change from baseline on various ECG variables and on ( 2 ) incidence of patients meeting criteria for potentially important changes from baseline on various ECG variables revealed no important differences between fluvoxamine maleate tablets and placebo. 6.8 Other Reactions Observed During the Pre-Marketing Evaluation of Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets During pre-marketing clinical trials conducted in North America and Europe, multiple doses of fluvoxamine maleate tablets were administered for a combined total of 2.737 patient exposures in patients suffering OCD or Major Depressive Disorder. Untoward reactions associated with this exposure were recorded by clinical investigators using descriptive terminology of their own choosing. Consequently, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of untoward reactions into a limited ( i.e. , reduced ) number of standard reaction categories. In the tabulations which follow, a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions. If the COSTART term for a reaction was so general as to be uninformative, it was replaced with a more informative term. The frequencies presented, therefore, represent the proportion of the 2.737 patient exposures to multiple doses of fluvoxamine maleate tablets who experienced a reaction of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving fluvoxamine maleate tablets. All reported reactions are included in the list below, with the following exceptions: 1 ) those reactions already listed in Table 2, which tabulates incidence rates of common adverse experiences in placebo-controlled OCD and depression clinical trials, are excluded; 2 ) those reactions for which a drug cause was not considered likely are omitted; 3 ) reactions for which the COSTART term was too vague to be clinically meaningful and could not be replaced with a more informative term; and 4 ) reactions which were reported in only one patient and judged to not be potentially serious are not included. It is important to emphasize that, although the reactions reported did occur during treatment with fluvoxamine maleate tablets, a causal relationship to fluvoxamine maleate tablets have not been established. Reactions are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are defined as those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring between 1/100 and 1/1.000 patients; and rare adverse reactions are those occurring in less than 1/1.000 patients. Body as a Whole: Frequent: malaise; Infrequent: photosensitivity reaction and suicide attempt. Cardiovascular System: Frequent: syncope. Digestive System: Infrequent: gastrointestinal hemorrhage and melena; Rare: hematemesis. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Infrequent: anemia and ecchymosis; Rare: purpura. Metabolic and Nutritional Systems: Frequent: weight gain and weight loss. Nervous System: Frequent: hyperkinesia, manic reaction, and myoclonus; Infrequent: abnormal dreams, akathisia, convulsion, dyskinesia, dystonia, euphoria, extrapyramidal syndrome, and twitching; Rare: withdrawal syndrome. Respiratory System: Infrequent: epistaxis; Rare: hemoptysis and laryngismus. Skin: Infrequent: urticaria. Urogenital System 1 : Infrequent: hematuria, menorrhagia, and vaginal hemorrhage; Rare: hematospermia. 1 Based on the number of males or females, as appropriate. 6.9 Post-Marketing Reports The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fluvoxamine maleate tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Voluntary reports of adverse reactions in patients taking fluvoxamine maleate tablets that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to fluvoxamine maleate tablets use include: acute renal failure, agranulocytosis, amenorrhea, anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, aplastic anemia, bullous eruption, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, hepatitis, ileus, pancreatitis, porphyria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vasculitis, ventricular tachycardia ( including torsades de pointes ) , anosmia and hyposmia.",
