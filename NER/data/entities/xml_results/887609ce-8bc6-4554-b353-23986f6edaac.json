    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Endophthalmitis, retinal detachments, and retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion may occur following intravitreal injections. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately. ( 5.1 ) Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection. ( 5.2 ) There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ( 5.4 ) 5.1\tEndophthalmitis, Retinal Detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion Intravitreal injections, including those with aflibercept products, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see and, more rarely, retinal vasculitis with or without occlusion Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering PAVBLU. Patients and/or caregivers should be instructed to report any signs and/or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, or retinal vasculitis without delay and should be managed appropriately Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.2\tIncrease in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with aflibercept products [see . Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.8) ] 5.4\tThromboembolic Events There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors, including aflibercept products. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1.8% (32 out of 1824) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 1.5% (9 out of 595) in patients treated with ranibizumab; through 96 weeks, the incidence was 3.3% (60 out of 1824) in the aflibercept group compared with 3.2% (19 out of 595) in the ranibizumab group. The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3.3% (19 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 2.8% (8 out of 287) in the control group; from baseline to week 100, the incidence was 6.4% (37 out of 578) in the combined group of patients treated with aflibercept compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group. There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with aflibercept in the first six months of the RVO studies.",

ADVERSE REACTIONS The following potentially serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.3) ] Endophthalmitis, retinal detachments, and Retinal Vasculitis with or without Occlusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Increase in intraocular pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amgen Inc. at 1-800-77-AMGEN (1-800-772-6436) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 2980 adult patients treated with aflibercept constituted the safety population in eight phase 3 studies. Among those, 2379 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg. Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in <0.1% of intravitreal injections with aflibercept including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) reported in patients receiving aflibercept were conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous detachment, vitreous floaters, and intraocular pressure increased. Neovascular (Wet) Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) The data described below reflect exposure to aflibercept in 1824 patients with wet AMD, including 1223 patients treated with the 2-mg dose, in 2 double-masked, controlled clinical studies (VIEW1 and VIEW2) for 24 months (with active control in year 1) [see . Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Safety data observed in the aflibercept group in a 52-week, double-masked, Phase 2 study were consistent with these results. Table 1.

Safety data observed in 269 patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) through week 52 in the PANORAMA trial were consistent with those seen in the phase 3 VIVID and VISTA trials (see Table 3 above). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of aflibercept. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: retinal vasculitis and occlusive retinal vasculitis related to intravitreal injection with aflibercept (reported at a rate of 0.6 and 0.2 per 1 million injections, respectively, based on postmarketing experience from November 2011 until November 2023).",
