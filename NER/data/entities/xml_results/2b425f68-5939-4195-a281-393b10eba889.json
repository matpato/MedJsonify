Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering IZERVAY in order to minimize the risk of endophthalmitis Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay, to permit prompt and appropriate management Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] [see . Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.2 Neovascular AMD In the GATHER1 and GATHER2 clinical trials, use of IZERVAY was associated with increased rates of neovascular (wet) AMD or choroidal neovascularization (7% when administered monthly and 4% in the sham group) by Month 12. Over 24\u00a0months, the rate of neovascular (wet) AMD or choroidal neovascularization in the GATHER2 trial was 12% in the IZERVAY group and 9% in the sham group.  Patients receiving IZERVAY should be monitored for signs of neovascular AMD. 5.3 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been observed after an intravitreal injection, including with IZERVAY [see . Perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored following the injection and managed as needed Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]",

The safety of avacincaptad pegol was evaluated in 733 patients with AMD in two sham-controlled studies (GATHER1 and GATHER2). Of these patients, 292 were treated with intravitreal IZERVAY 2 mg (0.1 mL of 20 mg/mL solution) [see . Three hundred thirty-two (332) patients were assigned to sham. Clinical Studies (14) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients who received treatment with IZERVAY pooled across GATHER1 and GATHER2, are listed below in Table 1 .
