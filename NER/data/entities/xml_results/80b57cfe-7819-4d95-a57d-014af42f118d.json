    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 QTc Prolongation: Avoid use of BLUJEPA in patients with a history of QTc prolongation, or with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, and in patients receiving drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Due to an increase in BLUJEPA exposure, avoid concomitant administration of BLUJEPA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) and in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min). ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Acetylcholinesterase inhibition: Dysarthria and other adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving BLUJEPA. Monitor patients with underlying medical conditions that may be exacerbated by acetylcholinesterase inhibition and patients receiving succinylcholine-type neuromuscular blocking agents, systemic anticholinergic medications, or non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving BLUJEPA. If an allergic reaction to BLUJEPA occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate supportive measures. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Clostridioides difficile Infection (CDI): CDI has been reported with nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including BLUJEPA. Evaluate patients who develop diarrhea. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 QTc Prolongation A dose and concentration-dependent prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed with BLUJEPA [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.2 )] Avoid BLUJEPA in patients with a history of QTc interval prolongation or those with relevant pre\u2011existing cardiac disease, patients taking antiarrhythmic agents, or other medications that may potentially prolong the QTc interval [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.4 )] Due to an increase in gepotidacin exposure (C max ) and the risk of QTc interval prolongation, avoid concomitant administration of BLUJEPA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole), in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child\u2011Pugh Class C), or in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <30 mL/min) [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 ), and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )] If administration of BLUJEPA cannot be avoided in these patients, monitor and correct serum electrolyte abnormalities and collect an ECG prior to administration and during treatment, as clinically indicated. 5.2 Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition BLUJEPA is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in in vitro laboratory studies. Adverse reactions including dysarthria, presyncope, muscle spasms, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypersalivation, and hyperhidrosis which are potentially attributed to acetylcholinesterase inhibition, have been observed in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions ( . Increased cholinergic effects can be associated with severe adverse reactions including atrioventricular block, bradycardia, bronchospasm, seizures/convulsions, and vasovagal syncope. Monitor patients with medical conditions that may be exacerbated by acetylcholinesterase inhibition. 6.1 )] BLUJEPA, as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, may exaggerate the neuromuscular effects of succinylcholine\u2011type muscle relaxation during anesthesia. BLUJEPA may exaggerate the effects of other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Monitor patients for exaggerated neuromuscular blockade or excessive cholinergic effects. Because BLUJEPA may antagonize the effects of systemic anticholinergic medications or non\u2011depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, monitor patients if BLUJEPA is concomitantly administered with these medications [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.3 )] 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving BLUJEPA [see Adverse Reactions ( . BLUJEPA is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to BLUJEPA 6.1 )] [see Contraindications ( Before therapy with BLUJEPA is instituted, carefully inquire about previous hypersensitivity reactions to BLUJEPA. If an allergic reaction to BLUJEPA occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate supportive measures. 4 )]. 5.4 Clostridioides difficile Infection Clostridioides difficile (C.\u00a0difficile) infection (CDI) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including BLUJEPA, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis [see Adverse Reactions ( . Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of 6 )] C.\u00a0difficile . C.\u00a0difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDI. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C.\u00a0difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDI must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDI has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDI is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C.\u00a0difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C.\u00a0difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing BLUJEPA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug\u2011resistant bacteria [see Indications and Usage ( . 1.2 )]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 QTc Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )] \u2022 Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.3 )] \u2022 Clostridioides difficile Infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.4 )] The most common adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of patients are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, headache, soft feces, dizziness, vomiting, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of BLUJEPA was evaluated in 2 double\u2011blind, active\u2011controlled, randomized trials in female adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with uUTI (Trial 1 and Trial 2). A total of 1,570 patients were treated with BLUJEPA and 1,558 patients were treated with nitrofurantoin (pooled safety populations for BLUJEPA and nitrofurantoin, respectively). Patients received treatment for a median duration of 5 days. In Trials 1 and 2 (pooled, intent-to-treat [ITT] population), the median age of patients treated with BLUJEPA was 49 (range 13 to 89) years; <1% were <18 years, 77% of patients were 18 to 64\u00a0years, 14% were 65 to 74 years, and 8% were \u226575 years. Patients were female (100%) and White (83%), Black or African American (7%), Asian (5%), or American Indian or Alaskan Native (4%); for ethnicity, 33% identified as Hispanic/Latino and 67% as non-Hispanic/Latino. The majority of patients were enrolled from the U.S. (55%). Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the pooled trials (Trials 1 and 2), serious adverse reactions occurred in 1/1,570 (<1%) patient treated with BLUJEPA and 1/1,558 (<1%) patient treated with nitrofurantoin. The serious adverse reaction reported with BLUJEPA was dysarthria. No adverse reaction led to death in either treatment group. In the pooled trials, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 79/1,570 (5%) of patients treated with BLUJEPA and 30/1,558 (2%) of patients treated with nitrofurantoin. Adverse reactions occurring in >1% of patients leading to treatment discontinuation in patients treated with BLUJEPA included diarrhea (3%) and nausea (1%). Common Adverse Reactions Table 1 lists the adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of patients receiving BLUJEPA in the pooled trials (Trials 1 and 2). Table 1.
