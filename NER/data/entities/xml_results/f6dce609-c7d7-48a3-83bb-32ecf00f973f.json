    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Droxidopa capsules may cause supine hypertension and may increase cardiovascular risk if supine hypertension is not well-managed ( 5.1 ) Hyperpyrexia and confusion ( 5.2 ) May exacerbate symptoms in patients with existing ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure ( 5.3 ) Allergic reactions ( 5.4 ) 5.1\tSupine Hypertension Droxidopa capsules therapy may cause or exacerbate supine hypertension in patients with nOH. Patients should be advised to elevate the head of the bed when resting or sleeping. Monitor blood pressure, both in the supine position and in the recommended head-elevated sleeping position. Reduce or discontinue droxidopa capsules if supine hypertension persists. If supine hypertension is not well-managed, droxidopa capsules may increase the risk of cardiovascular events , particularly\u00a0stroke. 5.2\tHyperpyrexia and Confusion Postmarketing cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported with droxidopa capsules use during postmarketing surveillance. Observe patients carefully when the dosage of droxidopa capsules is changed or when concomitant levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics. NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, and mental status changes. The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. 5.3\tIschemic Heart Disease, Arrhythmias, and Congestive Heart Failure Droxidopa capsules may exacerbate existing ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure. Careful consideration should be given to this potential risk prior to initiating therapy in patients with these conditions. 5.4 Allergic Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, urticaria and rash have been reported in postmarketing experience. Some of these reactions resulted in emergency treatment. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue the drug and initiate appropriate therapy.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions with droxidopa capsules are included in more detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of the label: Supine Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Hyperpyrexia and Confusion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] May exacerbate existing ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] The most common adverse reactions (>5% and \u22653% compared to placebo) are headache, dizziness, nausea, and hypertension ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-272-7901 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety evaluation of droxidopa capsules is based on two placebo-controlled studies 1 to 2 weeks in duration (Studies 301 and 302), one 8-week placebo-controlled study (Study 306), and two long-term, open-label extension studies (Studies 303 and 304). In the placebo-controlled studies, a total of 485 patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, or non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy were randomized and treated, 245 with droxidopa capsules and 240 with placebo [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] Placebo-Controlled Experience The most commonly observed adverse reactions (those occurring at an incidence of greater than 5% in the droxidopa capsules group and with at least a 3% greater incidence in the droxidopa capsules group than in the placebo group) in droxidopa capsules -treated patients during the three placebo-controlled trials were headache, dizziness, nausea, and hypertension. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation from droxidopa capsules were hypertension or increased blood pressure and nausea.

Adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 5% of patients in the droxidopa capsules group and with at least a 3% greater incidence in the droxidopa capsules group than in the placebo group were from Study 306. Long-Term, Open-Label Trials with droxidopa capsules In the long-term, open-label extension studies, a total of 422 patients, mean age 65 years, were treated with droxidopa capsules for a mean total exposure of approximately one year. The commonly reported adverse events were falls (24%), urinary tract infections (15%), headache (13%), syncope (13%), and dizziness (10%). 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of droxidopa capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
