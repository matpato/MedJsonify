Monitor liver function when combined with chemotherapy known to be associated with liver dysfunction. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Grade 3/4 hemorrhage has been reported in clinical studies in patients with newly diagnosed CML and with GIST. GI tumor sites may be the source of GI bleeds in GIST. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal (GI) perforations, some fatal, have been reported. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Cardiogenic shock/left ventricular dysfunction has been associated with the initiation of imatinib mesylate in patients with conditions associated with high eosinophil levels (e.g., HES, MDS/MPD, and ASM). ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Bullous dermatologic reactions (e.g., erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported with the use of imatinib mesylate. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Hypothyroidism has been reported in thyroidectomy patients undergoing levothyroxine replacement. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Apprise women of the potential harm to the fetus, and to use effective contraception. ( 5.10 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Growth retardation occurring in children and pre-adolescents receiving imatinib mesylate has been reported. Close monitoring of growth in children under imatinib mesylate treatment is recommended. ( 5.11 , 6.2 ) \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome. Close monitoring is recommended. ( 5.12 ) \u2022 Reports of motor vehicle accidents have been received in patients receiving imatinib mesylate. Caution patients about driving a car or operating machinery. ( 5.13 ) \u2022 Renal Toxicity. A decline in renal function may occur in patients receiving imatinib mesylate tablets. Evaluate renal function at baseline and during therapy, with attention to risk factors for renal dysfunction. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Fluid Retention and Edema Imatinib mesylate is often associated with edema and occasionally serious fluid retention [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. Weigh and monitor patients regularly for signs and symptoms of fluid retention. Investigate unexpected rapid weight gain carefully and provide appropriate treatment. The probability of edema was increased with higher imatinib mesylate dose and age greater than 65 years in the CML studies. Severe superficial edema was reported in 1.5% of newly diagnosed CML patients taking imatinib mesylate, and in 2% to 6% of other adult CML patients taking imatinib mesylate. In addition, other severe fluid retention (e.g., pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, and ascites) reactions were reported in 1.3% of newly diagnosed CML patients taking imatinib mesylate, and in 2% to 6% of other adult CML patients taking imatinib mesylate. Severe fluid retention was reported in 9% to 13.1% of patients taking imatinib mesylate for GIST 6.1 ) [see Adverse Reactions ( In\u00a0a\u00a0randomized\u00a0trial\u00a0in\u00a0patients with\u00a0newly\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0Ph+CML\u00a0in\u00a0chronic\u00a0phase\u00a0comparing imatinib mesylate\u00a0and\u00a0nilotinib,\u00a0severe\u00a0(Grade\u00a03\u00a0or\u00a04)\u00a0fluid\u00a0retention\u00a0occurred\u00a0in\u00a02.5%\u00a0of\u00a0patients receiving\u00a0imatinib mesylate\u00a0and\u00a0in\u00a03.9%\u00a0of\u00a0patients receiving\u00a0nilotinib\u00a0300\u00a0mg\u00a0twice daily.

Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month, biweekly for the second month, and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated (for example, every 2 to 3 months). In CML, the occurrence of these cytopenias is dependent on the stage of disease and is more frequent in patients with accelerated phase CML or blast crisis than in patients with chronic phase CML. In pediatric CML patients the most frequent toxicities observed were Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. These generally occur within the first several months of therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( ]. 2.14 ) 5.3 Congestive Heart Failure and Left Ventricular Dysfunction Congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction have been reported in patients taking imatinib mesylate. Cardiac adverse reactions were more frequent in patients with advanced age or co-morbidities, including previous medical history of cardiac disease. In an international randomized Phase 3 study in 1106 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase, severe cardiac failure and left ventricular dysfunction were observed in 0.7% of patients taking imatinib mesylate compared to 0.9% of patients taking IFN + Ara-C. In another randomized trial with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase that compared imatinib mesylate and nilotinib, cardiac failure was observed in 1.1% of patients in the imatinib mesylate arm and 2.2% of patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm and severe (Grade 3 or 4) cardiac failure occurred in 0.7% of patients in each group. Carefully monitor patients with cardiac disease or risk factors for cardiac or history of renal failure. Evaluate and treat any patient with signs or symptoms consistent with cardiac or renal failure. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity, occasionally severe, may occur with imatinib mesylate [see Adverse Reactions ( Cases of fatal liver failure and severe liver injury requiring liver transplants have been reported with both short-term and long-term use of imatinib mesylate. Monitor liver function (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) before initiation of treatment and monthly, or as clinically indicated. Manage laboratory abnormalities with imatinib mesylate interruption and/or dose reduction 6.1 )]. [see Dosage and Administration ( When imatinib mesylate is combined with chemotherapy, liver toxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia has been observed. Additionally, there have been reports of acute liver failure. Monitoring of hepatic function is recommended. 2.13 )]. 5.5 Hemorrhage In a trial of imatinib mesylate versus IFN+Ara-C in patients with the newly diagnosed CML, 1.8% of patients had Grade 3/4 hemorrhage. In the Phase 3 unresectable or metastatic GIST studies, 211 patients (12.9%) reported Grade 3/4 hemorrhage at any site. In the Phase 2 unresectable or metastatic GIST study, 7 patients (5%) had a total of 8 CTC Grade 3/4 hemorrhages; gastrointestinal (GI) (3 patients), intra-tumoral (3 patients) or both (1 patient). Gastrointestinal tumor sites may have been the source of GI hemorrhages. In a randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing imatinib mesylate and nilotinib, GI hemorrhage occurred in 1.4% of patients in the imatinib mesylate arm, and in 2.9% of patients in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm. None of these events were Grade 3 or 4 in the imatinib mesylate arm; 0.7% were Grade 3 or 4 in the nilotinib 300 mg twice daily arm. In addition, gastric antral vascular ectasia has been reported in postmarketing experience. 5.6 Gastrointestinal Disorders Imatinib mesylate is sometimes associated with GI irritation. Imatinib mesylate tablets should be taken with food and a large glass of water to minimize this problem. There have been rare reports, including fatalities, of GI perforation. 5.7 Hypereosinophilic Cardiac Toxicity In patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome with occult infiltration of HES cells within the myocardium, cases of cardiogenic shock/left ventricular dysfunction have been associated with HES cell degranulation upon the initiation of imatinib mesylate therapy. The condition was reported to be reversible with the administration of systemic steroids, circulatory support measures and temporarily withholding imatinib mesylate. Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease and systemic mastocytosis may be associated with high eosinophil levels. Consider performing an echocardiogram and determining serum troponin in patients with HES/CEL, and in patients with MDS/MPD or ASM associated with high eosinophil levels. If either is abnormal, consider prophylactic use of systemic steroids (1 to 2 mg/kg) for one to two weeks concomitantly with imatinib mesylate at the initiation of therapy. 5.8 Dermatologic Toxicities Bullous dermatologic reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported with use of imatinib mesylate. In some cases of bullous dermatologic reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome reported during postmarketing surveillance, a recurrent dermatologic reaction was observed upon rechallenge. Several foreign postmarketing reports have described cases in which patients tolerated the reintroduction of imatinib mesylate therapy after resolution or improvement of the bullous reaction. In these instances, imatinib mesylate was resumed at a dose lower than that at which the reaction occurred and some patients also received concomitant treatment with corticosteroids or antihistamines. 5.9 Hypothyroidism Clinical cases of hypothyroidism have been reported in thyroidectomy patients undergoing levothyroxine replacement during treatment with imatinib mesylate tablets. Monitor TSH levels in such patients. 5.10 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Imatinib mesylate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Imatinib mesylate was teratogenic in rats when administered during organogenesis at doses approximately equal to the maximum human dose of 800 mg/day based on body surface area (BSA). Significant post-implantation loss was seen in female rats administered imatinib mesylate at doses approximately one-half the maximum human dose of 800 mg/day based on BSA. Advise sexually active\u00a0female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) when using imatinib mesylate tablets and for 14 days after stopping imatinib mesylate tablets. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] 5.11 Growth Retardation in Children and Adolescents Growth retardation has been reported in children and pre-adolescents receiving imatinib mesylate tablets. The long-term effects of prolonged treatment with imatinib mesylate on growth in children are unknown. Therefore, monitor growth in children under imatinib mesylate treatment [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.12 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Cases of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), including fatal cases, have been reported in patients with CML, GIST, ALL, and eosinophilic leukemia receiving imatinib mesylate tablets. The patients at risk of TLS are those with tumors having a high proliferative rate or high tumor burden prior to treatment. Monitor these patients closely and take appropriate precautions. Due to possible occurrence of TLS, correct clinically significant dehydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiation of imatinib mesylate. 5.13 Impairments Related to Driving and Using Machinery Motor vehicle accidents have been reported in patients receiving imatinib mesylate tablets. Advise patients that they may experience side effects, such as dizziness, blurred vision, or somnolence during treatment with imatinib mesylate. Recommend caution when driving a car or operating machinery. 5.14 Renal Toxicity A decline in renal function may occur in patients receiving imatinib mesylate tablets. Median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values in patients on imatinib mesylate tablets 400 mg daily for newly-diagnosed CML (four randomized trials) and malignant GIST (one single-arm trial) declined from a baseline value of 85 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (N = 1190) to 75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at 12 months (N = 1082) and 69 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at 60 months (N = 549). Evaluate renal function prior to initiating imatinib mesylate tablets and monitor during therapy, with attention to risk factors for renal dysfunction, such as preexisting renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and congestive heart failure.",

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia The majority of imatinib mesylate-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. Imatinib was discontinued due to drug-related adverse reactions in 2.4% of patients receiving imatinib mesylate in the randomized trial of newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing imatinib mesylate versus IFN+Ara-C, and in 12.5% of patients receiving imatinib mesylate in the randomized trial of newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase comparing imatinib mesylate and nilotinib. Imatinib mesylate was discontinued due to drug-related adverse reactions in 4% of patients in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, in 4% of patients in accelerated phase and in 5% of patients in blast crisis. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions were edema, nausea and vomiting, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea and rash (Table 2 and Table 3 for newly diagnosed CML, Table 4 for other CML patients). Edema was most frequently periorbital or in lower limbs and was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of Imatinib [ see Dosage and Administration ( ]. The frequency of severe superficial edema was 1.5% to 6%. 2.13 ) A variety of adverse reactions represent local or general fluid retention, including pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary edema, and rapid weight gain with or without superficial edema. These reactions appear to be dose related, were more common in the blast crisis and accelerated phase studies (where the dose was 600 mg/day), and are more common in the elderly. These reactions were usually managed by interrupting imatinib mesylate treatment and using diuretics or other appropriate supportive care measures. These reactions may be serious or life threatening. Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the imatinib mesylate-treated patients are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4.

Hematologic and Biochemistry Laboratory Abnormalities Cytopenias, and particularly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, were a consistent finding in all studies, with a higher frequency at doses greater than or equal to 750 mg (Phase 1 study). The occurrence of cytopenias in CML patients was also dependent on the stage of the disease. In patients with newly diagnosed CML, cytopenias were less frequent than in the other CML patients (see Tables 5, 6, and 7). The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was between 2- and 3-fold higher in blast crisis and accelerated phase compared to chronic phase (see Tables 4 and 5). The median duration of the neutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes varied from 2 to 3 weeks, and from 2 to 4 weeks, respectively. These reactions can usually be managed with either a reduction of the dose or an interruption of treatment with imatinib mesylate but may require permanent discontinuation of treatment.

Hepatotoxicity Severe elevation of transaminases or bilirubin occurred in approximately 5% of CML patients (see Tables 6 and 7) and were usually managed with dose reduction or interruption (the median duration of these episodes was approximately 1 week). Treatment was discontinued permanently because of liver laboratory abnormalities in less than 1.0% of CML patients. One patient, who was taking acetaminophen regularly for fever, died of acute liver failure. In the Phase 2 GIST trial, Grade 3 or 4 SGPT (ALT) elevations were observed in 6.8% of patients and Grade 3 or 4 SGOT (AST) elevations were observed in 4.8% of patients. Bilirubin elevation was observed in 2.7% of patients. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Population Single-Agent Therapy The overall safety profile of pediatric patients treated with imatinib mesylate in 93 children studied was similar to that found in studies with adult patients, except that musculoskeletal pain was less frequent (20.5%) and peripheral edema was not reported. Nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported individual adverse reactions with an incidence similar to that seen in adult patients. Most patients experienced adverse reactions at some time during the study. The incidence of Grade 3/4 events across all types of adverse reactions was 75%; the events with the highest Grade 3/4 incidence in CML pediatric patients were mainly related to myelosuppression. In Combination with Multi-Agent Chemotherapy Pediatric and young adult patients with very high risk ALL, defined as those with an expected 5 year event-free survival (EFS) less than 45%, were enrolled after induction therapy on a multicenter, non-randomized cooperative group pilot protocol. The study population included patients with a median age of 10 years (1 to 21 years), 61% of whom were male, 75% were white, 7% were black, and 6% were Asian/Pacific Islander. Patients with Ph+ ALL (n = 92) were assigned to receive imatinib mesylate tablets and treated in 5 successive cohorts. Imatinib mesylate tablets exposure was systematically increased in successive cohorts by earlier introduction and more prolonged duration. The safety of imatinib mesylate tablets given in combination with intensive chemotherapy was evaluated by comparing the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, neutropenia (less than 750/mcL) and thrombocytopenia (less than 75,000/mcL) in the 92 patients with Ph+ ALL compared to 65 patients with Ph-ALL enrolled on the trial who did not receive imatinib mesylate tablets. The safety was also evaluated comparing the incidence of adverse events in cycles of therapy administered with or without imatinib mesylate tablets. The protocol included up to 18 cycles of therapy. Patients were exposed to a cumulative total of 1,425 cycles of therapy, 778 with imatinib mesylate tablets, and 647 without imatinib mesylate tablets. The adverse events that were reported with a 5% or greater incidence in patients with Ph+ ALL compared to Ph-ALL or with a 1% or greater incidence in cycles of therapy that included imatinib mesylate tablets are presented in Table 8.

Adverse Reactions in Other Subpopulations In older patients (greater than or equal to\u00a065 years old), with the exception of edema, where it was more frequent, there was no evidence of an increase in the incidence or severity of adverse reactions. In women there was an increase in the frequency of neutropenia, as well as Grade 1/2 superficial edema, headache, nausea, rigors, vomiting, rash, and fatigue. No differences were seen that were related to race but the subsets were too small for proper evaluation. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia The adverse reactions were similar for Ph+ ALL as for Ph+ CML. The most frequently reported drug-related adverse reactions reported in the Ph+ ALL studies were mild nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, muscle cramps, and rash. Superficial edema was a common finding in all studies and were described primarily as periorbital or lower limb edemas. These edemas were reported as Grade 3/4 events in 6.3% of the patients and may be managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or in some patients by reducing the dose of imatinib mesylate. Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Diseases Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the patients treated with imatinib mesylate for MDS/MPD in the Phase 2 study, are shown in Table 9 .

Aggressive Systemic Mastocytosis All aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) patients experienced at least one adverse reaction at some time. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea, nausea, ascites, muscle cramps, dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema, anemia, pruritus, rash, and lower respiratory tract infection. None of the 5 patients in the Phase 2 study with ASM discontinued imatinib mesylate due to drug-related adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory values. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome and Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia The safety profile in the HES/CEL patient population does not appear to be different from the safety profile of imatinib mesylate observed in other hematologic malignancy populations, such as Ph+ CML. All patients experienced at least one adverse reaction, the most common being GI, cutaneous and musculoskeletal disorders. Hematological abnormalities were also frequent, with instances of CTC Grade 3 leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and anemia. Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the 12 patients treated with imatinib mesylate for DFSP in the Phase 2 study are shown in Table 10.

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Unresectable and/or Malignant Metastatic GIST In the Phase 3 trials, the majority of imatinib mesylate-treated patients experienced adverse reactions at some time. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were edema, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, vomiting, myalgia, anemia, and anorexia. Drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in a total of 89 patients (5.4%). Superficial edema, most frequently periorbital or lower extremity edema was managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of imatinib mesylate [see Dosage and Administration ( Severe (CTC Grade 3/4) edema was observed in 182 patients (11.1%). 2.13 )]. Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 10% of the patients treated with imatinib mesylate are shown in Table 12. Overall the incidence of all grades of adverse reactions and the incidence of severe adverse reactions (CTC Grade 3 and above) were similar between the two treatment arms except for edema, which was reported more frequently in the 800 mg group.

Adjuvant Treatment of GIST In Study 1, the majority of both imatinib mesylate and placebo-treated patients experienced at least one adverse reaction at some time. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were similar to those reported in other clinical studies in other patient populations and include diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, edema, decreased hemoglobin, rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain. No new adverse reactions were reported in the adjuvant GIST-treatment setting that had not been previously reported in other patient populations, including patients with unresectable and/or malignant metastatic GIST. Drug was discontinued for adverse reactions in 57 patients (17%) and 11 patients (3%) of the imatinib mesylate and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Edema, GI disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, and diarrhea), fatigue, low hemoglobin, and rash were the most frequently reported adverse reactions at the time of discontinuation. In Study 2, discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 15 patients (8%) and 27 patients (14%) of the imatinib mesylate 12-month, and 36-month treatment arms, respectively. As in previous trials the most common adverse reactions were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, edema, decreased hemoglobin, rash, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Adverse reactions, regardless of relationship to study drug, that were reported in at least 5% of the patients treated with imatinib mesylate are shown in Table 14 (Study 1) and Table 15 (Study 2). There were no deaths attributable to imatinib mesylate treatment in either trial.
