    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules are contraindicated in patients with: Known hypersensitivity to amphetamine, or other components of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules. Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with other amphetamine products [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] Concomitant treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and also within 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, because of an increased risk of hypertensive crisis [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 )] Known hypersensitivity to amphetamine products or other ingredients in dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules. (4 ) Use with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, or within 14 days of the last MAO inhibitor dose. ( 4 , 7.1 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease: Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. ( 5.2 ) Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Monitor blood pressure and pulse. ( 5.3 ) Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: Prior to initiating dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode. If new psychotic or manic symptoms occur, consider discontinuing dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules. ( 5.4 ) Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients: Closely monitor growth (height and weight) in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. ( 5.5 ) Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon: Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. ( 5.6 ) Seizures: May lower the convulsive threshold. If a seizure occurs, discontinue dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules. ( 5.7 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when coadministered with serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans), but also during overdosage situations. If it occurs, discontinue dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules and initiate supportive treatment. ( 5.8 ) Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome: Before initiating dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Regularly monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and\nAddiction Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules have a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( . Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, can result in overdose and death 9.2 )] [see Overdosage ( , and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. 10 )] Before prescribing dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules to anyone else. Throughout dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules treatment, reassess each patient\u2019s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. 5.2 Risks to\nPatients with Serious Cardiac Disease Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. 5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2 to 4 mmHg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3 to 6 bpm). Some patients may have larger increases. Monitor all dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules-treated patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression). New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules. 5.5 Long-Term Suppression of Growth\u00a0in Pediatric Patients CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. In a 4 week, placebo-controlled trial of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules in patients ages 6 to 17 years old with ADHD, there was a decrease in weight in the dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules-treated pediatric patients. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules are not approved for use in pediatric patients 12 years and younger [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] 5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon CNS stimulants, including dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, sequelae have included digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, were observed in postmarketing reports and at the therapeutic dosage of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improved after dosage reduction or discontinuation of the CNS stimulant. Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. 5.7 Seizures Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizure, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules should be discontinued. 5.8 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John\u2019s Wort [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . The coadministration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules. In these situations, consider an alternative nonserotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1) ] Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Concomitant use of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] Discontinue treatment with dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome. 5.9 Potential for Overdose Due to Medication Errors Medication errors, including substitution and dispensing errors, between dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules and other amphetamine products could occur, leading to possible overdosage. To avoid substitution errors and overdosage, do not substitute for other amphetamine products on a milligram-per-milligram basis because of different amphetamine base compositions and differing pharmacokinetic profiles [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ), Overdosage ( 10 )]. 5.10 Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome CNS stimulants, including amphetamine, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette\u2019s syndrome has also been reported [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] Before initiating dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules, assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome. Regularly monitor dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules-treated patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.",

( 6.1 ) Adults: insomnia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, dry mouth, increased heart rate, and anxiety. (6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules were studied in adults (18 to 55 years) and pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th or 5 th editions (DSM-IV-TR \u00ae or DSM-5) criteria for ADHD. The safety data for adults were pooled from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg per day (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). Doses higher than 50 mg per day did not demonstrate additional clinical benefit and are not recommended. The safety data for pediatric patients (13 to 17 years) is from 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of doses of 12.5 mg to 25 mg. The total exposure in patients treated with dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsules totalled 704; this included pediatric patients, 78 adolescent patients and 626 adult patients from multiple well-controlled trials. The duration of use ranged from 4 to 7 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment In pooled controlled trials of adult patients, 9% (54/626) of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 2% (7/328) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were insomnia (2%, n=15), blood pressure increased (2%, n=10), decreased appetite (1%, n=5), and headache (1%, n=4). In a controlled trial including adolescent patients (13 to 17 years), 5% (4/78) of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions compared to 0% (0/79) of placebo-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine aspartate monohydrate, dextroamphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine sulfate extended-release capsule-treated patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) were dizziness (1%, n=1), depression (1%, n=1), abdominal pain upper (1%, n=1), and viral infection (1%, n=1). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of \u22652% and at Least Twice Placebo Among Dextroamphetamine Saccharate, Amphetamine Aspartate Monohydrate, Dextroamphetamine Sulfate, and Amphetamine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsule-Treated Adults in Clinical Trials The most common adverse reactions reported in adults were insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, decreased weight, heart rate increased, and anxiety.
