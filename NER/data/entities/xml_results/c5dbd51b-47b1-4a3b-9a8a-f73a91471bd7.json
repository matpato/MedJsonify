    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Cefepime Injection is a cephalosporin antibacterial indicated in the treatment of the following infections caused by susceptible isolates of the designated microorganisms: pneumonia ( 1.1 ); empiric therapy for febrile neutropenic patients ( 1.2 ); uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections ( 1.3 ); uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections ( 1.4 ); and complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with metronidazole) ( 1.5 ). To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefepime Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefepime Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.6 ) 1.1 Pneumonia Cefepime Injection is indicated for pneumonia (moderate to severe) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Enterobacter species. 1.2 Empiric Therapy for Febrile Neutropenic Patients Cefepime Injection as monotherapy is indicated for empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients. In patients at high risk for severe infection (including patients with a history of recent bone marrow transplantation, with hypotension at presentation, with an underlying hematologic malignancy, or with severe or prolonged neutropenia), antimicrobial monotherapy may not be appropriate. Insufficient data exist to support the efficacy of cefepime monotherapy in such patients [ see ]. Clinical Studies (14) 1.3 Uncomplicated and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (including pyelonephritis) Cefepime Injection is indicated for uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis) caused by Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, when the infection is severe, or caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis, when the infection is mild to moderate, including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia with these microorganisms. 1.4 Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections Cefepime Injection is indicated for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only) or Streptococcus pyogenes . 1.5 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections Cefepime Injection is indicated for complicated intra-abdominal infections (used in combination with metronidazole) caused by Escherichia coli, viridans group streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, or Bacteroides fragilis [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 1.6 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefepime Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Cefepime Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Cefepime Injection is contraindicated in patients who have shown immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefepime or the cephalosporin class of antibacterials, penicillins or other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with known allergy to corn or corn products. \u2022 Prior immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefepime or the cephalosporin class of antibacterial drugs, penicillins, and other beta-lactam antibacterial drugs. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy.  If an allergic reaction to Cefepime Injection occurs, discontinue the drug. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neurotoxicity: May occur especially in patients with renal impairment administered unadjusted doses.  If neurotoxicity associated with Cefepime Injection therapy occurs, discontinue the drug. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea (CDAD): Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Before therapy with Cefepime Injection is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefepime, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other beta-lactams. Exercise caution if this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients because cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Cefepime Injection occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate supportive measures. 5.2 Neurotoxicity Serious adverse reactions have been reported including life-threatening or fatal occurrences of the following: encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness including confusion, hallucinations, stupor, and coma), aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus [see Most cases occurred in patients with renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustment. However, some cases of neurotoxicity occurred in patients receiving a dosage adjustment appropriate for their degree of renal impairment. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. In the majority of cases, symptoms of neurotoxicity were reversible and resolved after discontinuation of cefepime and/or after hemodialysis. If neurotoxicity associated with cefepime therapy occurs, discontinue cefepime and institute appropriate supportive measures. 5.3 Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Cefepime Injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing cefepime in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. As with other antimicrobials, prolonged use of cefepime may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms. Repeated evaluation of the patient\u2019s condition is essential. Should superinfection occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken. 5.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Urinary Glucose The administration of cefepime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine when using some methods (e.g. Clinitest tablets) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Coombs' Tests Positive direct Coombs\u2019 tests have been reported during treatment with cefepime. In patients who develop hemolytic anemia, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy. Positive Coombs\u2019 test may be observed in newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin antibacterials before parturition. Prothrombin Time Many cephalosporins, including cefepime, have been associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antibacterial therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk, and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Neurotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Clostridioides difficile -associated diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 1 %) were local reactions positive Coombs\u2019 test, decreased phosphorous, increased ALT and AST, increased PT and PTT and rash. ( 6.1 ) \u2022 At the highest dose (2 g every 8 hours), incidence of adverse reactions was \u22651% for rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pruritis, fever, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter at 1-866-888-2472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials using multiple doses of cefepime, 4137 patients were treated with the recommended dosages of cefepime (500 mg to 2 g intravenously every 12 hours). There were no deaths or permanent disabilities thought related to drug toxicity. Sixty\u2011four (1.5%) patients discontinued medication due to adverse reactions. Thirty-three (51%) of these 64 patients who discontinued therapy did so because of rash.  The percentage of cefepime-treated patients who discontinued study drug because of drug-related adverse reactions was similar at daily doses of 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g every 12 hours (0.8%, 1.1%, and 2%, respectively). However, the incidence of discontinuation due to rash increased with the higher recommended doses. The following adverse reactions ( Table 3 ) were identified in clinical trials conducted in North America (n=3125 cefepime-treated patients). Table 3:  Adverse Reactions in Cefepime Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens Clinical Trials in North America INCIDENCE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 1% Local adverse reactions (3%), including phlebitis (1.3%), pain and/or inflammation (0.6%) Local reactions, irrespective of relationship to cefepime in those patients who received intravenous infusion (n=3048). ; rash (1.1%) INCIDENCE LESS THAN 1% BUT GREATER THAN 0.1% Colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis), diarrhea, erythema, fever, headache, nausea, oral moniliasis, pruritus, urticaria, vaginitis, vomiting, anemia At the higher dose of 2 g every 8 hours, the incidence of adverse reactions was higher among the 795 patients who received this dose of cefepime. They consisted of rash (4%), diarrhea (3%), nausea (2%), vomiting (1%), pruritus (1%), fever (1%), and headache (1%). The following ( Table 4 ) adverse laboratory changes with cefepime, were seen during clinical trials conducted in North America. Table 4: Adverse Laboratory Changes in Cefepime Multiple-Dose Dosing Regimens Clinical Trials in North America INCIDENCE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 1% Positive Coombs\u2019 test (without hemolysis) (16.2%); decreased phosphorus (2.8%); increased Alanine Transaminase (ALT) (2.8%), Aspartate Transaminase (AST) (2.4%), eosinophils (1.7%); abnormal PTT (1.6%), Prothrombin Time (PT) (1.4%) INCIDENCE LESS THAN 1% BUT GREATER THAN 0.1% Increased alkaline phosphatase, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), calcium, creatinine, phosphorus, potassium, total bilirubin; decreased calcium Hypocalcemia was more common among elderly patients. Clinical consequences from changes in either calcium or phosphorus were not reported. , hematocrit, neutrophils, platelets, White Blood Cells (WBC) A similar safety profile was seen in clinical trials of pediatric patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Cefepime Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. In addition to the adverse reactions reported during North American clinical trials with cefepime, the following adverse reactions have been reported during worldwide postmarketing experience. Encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness including confusion, hallucinations, stupor, and coma), aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Anaphylaxis including anaphylactic shock, transient leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, have been reported. 6.3 Cephalosporin-Class Adverse Reactions In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cefepime, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin-class antibacterial drugs: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, fall in prothrombin activity, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, and pancytopenia.",
