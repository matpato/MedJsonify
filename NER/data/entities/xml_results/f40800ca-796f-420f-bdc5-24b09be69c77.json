Alhemo is contraindicated in patients with a history of known serious hypersensitivity to Alhemo or its components or the inactive ingredients. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Thromboembolic Events: Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events. Monitor patients for thromboembolic events. Advise patients to report these signs and symptoms, and if they occur discontinue prophylaxis. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: In the event of a severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue Alhemo. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Increased Laboratory Values of Fibrin D dimer and Prothrombin Fragment 1+2. Alhemo increases values of fibrin D dimer and prothrombin fragment 1+2. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Thromboembolic Events Venous and arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 1.3% of patients (4/320) in Alhemo clinical trials. These cases occurred in patients with multiple risk factors for thromboembolism, including the use of high doses or prolonged treatment with factor product or bypassing agent (2 of 4 events). Risk factors for thromboembolism may include the use of high and/or frequent doses of breakthrough bleed treatments (factor products or bypassing agents) or conditions in which tissue factor is overexpressed (e.g., atherosclerotic disease, crush injury, cancer, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic microangiopathy, or septicemia). Inform Alhemo treated patients of signs and symptoms of thromboembolic events. Monitor patients for thromboembolic events. In case of suspicion of thromboembolic events, discontinue Alhemo and initiate further investigations and management strategies. 5.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Alhemo is contraindicated in patients with a history of known serious hypersensitivity to Alhemo or its components or the inactive ingredients. Hypersensitivity reactions including erythema, rash, pruritus, and abdominal pain have occurred in Alhemo treated patients. One patient (less than 1% of patients treated in the clinical studies) experienced anaphylaxis which resolved after treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Instruct patients of the signs of acute hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider for mild reactions and to seek urgent medical attention for moderate to severe reactions. Discontinue Alhemo if severe hypersensitivity symptoms occur, and initiate medical management. 5.3 Increased Laboratory Values of Fibrin D-dimer and Prothrombin Fragment 1+2 Increased levels of fibrin D-dimer and increased levels of prothrombin fragment 1.2 were seen in 29 (9.1%) and 18 (5.6%) of patients, respectively. The plasma concentration of concizumab-mtci is positively correlated with fibrin D-dimer and prothrombin fragments 1.2 indicating a hemostatic effect of concizumab-mtci. For patients taking Alhemo, these coagulation biomarkers may not be reliable predictive markers for clinical decision-making with suspicion of thrombosis such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u2022 Increased Laboratory Values of Fibrin D-dimer and Prothrombin Fragment 1+2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%) were injection site reactions and urticaria.  ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1   Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect  exposure to Alhemo  based on pooled data from clinical trials explorer3 (phase 1b), explorer4 (phase 2), explorer5 (phase 2), explorer7 (phase 3) and explorer8 (phase 3), in which a total of 320 male patients with hemophilia A with and without inhibitors and hemophilia B with and without inhibitors received at least one dose of Alhemo as routine prophylaxis. The patients were exposed for a total of 475 exposure years. Patients with HAwI (hemophilia A with inhibitors) and HBwI (hemophilia B with inhibitors) The data described below reflect exposure of 52 patients with HAwI and HBwI who were previously treated on-demand therapy and who were randomized in explorer7 to arm 1 to receive on- demand treatment with bypassing agents (n = 19) or arm 2 to receive Alhemo prophylaxis (n = 33) at the recommended dosing regimen [see Clinical Studies ( . The median duration of treatment was 31.1 weeks (range 3.9, 72.9 weeks) in arm 1 (on- demand arm) and 40.1 weeks (range 3.1, 56.3 weeks) in arm 2 (Alhemo prophylaxis). 14 )] Serious adverse reactions were reported in 6.1% of patients who received Alhemo. These serious adverse reactions were renal infarct and hypersensitivity reaction. Permanent discontinuation of Alhemo due to an adverse reaction occurred in 1 patient due to a renal infarct. Dosage interruptions of Alhemo due to an adverse reaction occurred in 1 patient (3%) and was a hypersensitivity reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) were injection site reactions and urticaria (see Table 1 ). Table 1.
