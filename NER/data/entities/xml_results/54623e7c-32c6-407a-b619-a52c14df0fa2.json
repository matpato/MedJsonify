    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE AMONDYS 45 is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients who were treated with AMONDYS 45. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate medical treatment and consider slowing the infusion, interrupting or discontinuing the AMONDYS 45 infusion ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) Kidney Toxicity: Based on animal data, may cause kidney toxicity.  Kidney function should be monitored; creatinine may not be a reliable measure of renal function in DMD patients. ( 5.2 , 13.2 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients who were treated with AMONDYS 45. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate medical treatment, and consider slowing the infusion [see Dosage and Administration ( , interrupting, or discontinuing the AMONDYS 45 infusion and monitor until the condition resolves. AMONDYS 45 is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to casimersen or to any of the inactive ingredients in AMONDYS 45 2.4 )] [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.2 Kidney Toxicity Kidney toxicity was observed in animals who received casimersen [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Although kidney toxicity was not observed in the clinical studies with AMONDYS 45, kidney toxicity, including potentially fatal glomerulonephritis, has been observed after administration of some antisense oligonucleotides.  Kidney function should be monitored in patients taking AMONDYS 45. Because of the effect of reduced skeletal muscle mass on creatinine measurements, creatinine may not be a reliable measure of kidney function in DMD patients.  Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting AMONDYS 45. Consider also measuring glomerular filtration rate using an exogenous filtration marker before starting AMONDYS 45. During treatment, monitor urine dipstick every month, and serum cystatin C and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) every three months. Only urine expected to be free of excreted AMONDYS 45 should be used for monitoring of urine protein. Urine obtained on the day of AMONDYS 45 infusion prior to the infusion, or urine obtained at least 48 hours after the most recent infusion, may be used. Alternatively, use a laboratory test that does not use the reagent pyrogallol red, as this reagent has the potential to cross react with any AMONDYS 45 that is excreted in the urine and thus lead to a false positive result for urine protein. 8.4 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] If a persistent increase in serum cystatin C or proteinuria is detected, refer to a pediatric nephrologist for further evaluation.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Kidney toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] The most common adverse reactions (incidence >20% and at least 5% higher than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection, cough, pyrexia, headache, arthralgia, and oropharyngeal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. at 1-888-SAREPTA (1-888-727-3782) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the AMONDYS 45 clinical development program, 76 patients received at least one intravenous dose of AMONDYS 45 (30 mg/kg).  All patients were male and had genetically confirmed Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  Age at study entry was 7 to 20 years (mean 9.9 years). Most (88%) patients were White, and 9% were Asian. AMONDYS 45 was studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 1). Patients in ongoing Study 1 received AMONDYS 45 (n=57) 30 mg/kg or placebo (n=31) intravenously once weekly for up to 96 weeks, after which all patients received or will receive AMONDYS 45 30 mg/kg for up to 48 weeks. Adverse reactions observed in \u226520% of patients treated with AMONDYS 45 and 5% more frequently than in the placebo group in Study 1 are shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Adverse Reactions Occurring in at Least 20% of Patients Treated with AMONDYS 45 and at a Rate at Least 5% More Frequently than in the Placebo Group in Study 1 *Includes upper respiratory infection, pharyngitis, nasopharyngitis, and rhinitis. Adverse Reaction AMONDYS 45 30 mg/kg Once Weekly (n = 57) % Placebo (n = 31) % Upper Respiratory Tract Infections* 65 55 Cough 33 26 Pyrexia 33 23 Headache 32 19 Arthralgia 21 10 Oropharyngeal Pain 21 7 Other adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with AMONDYS 45, and that were reported at a rate at least 5% more frequently in the AMONDYS 45 group than in the placebo group, were:  ear pain, nausea, ear infection, post-traumatic pain, and dizziness and light-headedness. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of AMONDYS 45. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion-related reactions including rash, headache, cough, abdominal pain (including upper abdominal pain), and vomiting occurred within 24 hours from the start of an infusion of AMONDYS 45. Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients treated with AMONDYS 45.",
