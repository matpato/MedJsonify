    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma: can lead to permanent visual loss; discontinue topiramate tablets as soon as possible ( 5.1 ) Visual field defects: consider discontinuation of topiramate tablets ( 5.2 ) Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia: monitor decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in pediatric patients ( 5.3 ) Metabolic acidosis: baseline and periodic measurement of serum bicarbonate is recommended; consider dose reduction or discontinuation of topiramate tablets if clinically appropriate ( 5.4 ) Suicidal behavior and ideation: antiepileptic drugs increase the risk of suicidal behavior or ideation ( 5.5 ) Cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions: use caution when operating machinery including cars; depression and mood problems may occur ( 5.6 ) Fetal Toxicity: use during pregnancy can cause major congenital malformations, including but not limited to cleft lip and/or palate, and being small for gestational age ( 5.7 ) Withdrawal of AEDs: withdraw topiramate tablets gradually ( 5.8 ) Decrease in Bone Mineral Density: has been shown to decrease bone mineral density and bone mineral content in pediatric patients ( 5.9 ) Negative effects on growth (height and weight): may slow height increase and weight gain; carefully monitor children receiving prolonged therapy ( 5.10 ) Serious skin reactions: If SJS or TEN is suspected, discontinue topiramate tablets ( 5.11 ) Hyperammonemia/encephalopathy: measure ammonia if encephalopathic symptoms occur ( 5.12 ) Kidney stones: avoid use with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, drugs causing metabolic acidosis, or in patients on a ketogenic diet ( 5.13 ) Hypothermia has been reported with and without hyperammonemia during topiramate treatment with concomitant valproic acid use ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle Closure Glaucoma Syndrome A syndrome consisting of acute myopia associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma has been reported in patients receiving topiramate tablets. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity and/or ocular pain. Ophthalmologic findings can include some or all of the following: myopia, mydriasis, anterior chamber shallowing, ocular hyperemia (redness), choroidal detachments, retinal pigment epithelial detachments, macular striae, and increased intraocular pressure. This syndrome may be associated with supraciliary effusion resulting in anterior displacement of the lens and iris, with secondary angle closure glaucoma. Symptoms typically occur within 1 month of initiating topiramate tablets therapy. In contrast to primary narrow angle glaucoma, which is rare under 40 years of age, secondary angle closure glaucoma associated with topiramate has been reported in pediatric patients as well as adults. The primary treatment to reverse symptoms is discontinuation of topiramate tablets as rapidly as possible, according to the judgment of the treating physician. Other measures, in conjunction with discontinuation of topiramate tablets, may be helpful. Elevated intraocular pressure of any etiology, if left untreated, can lead to serious sequelae including permanent vision loss. 5.2 Visual Field Defects Visual field defects (independent of elevated intraocular pressure) have been reported in clinical trials and in postmarketing experience in patients receiving topiramate. In clinical trials, most of these events were reversible after topiramate discontinuation. If visual problems occur at any time during topiramate treatment, consideration should be given to discontinuing the drug. 5.3 Oligohidrosis and Hyperthermia Oligohidrosis (decreased sweating), infrequently resulting in hospitalization, has been reported in association with topiramate tablets use. Decreased sweating and an elevation in body temperature above normal characterized these cases. Some of the cases were reported after exposure to elevated environmental temperatures. The majority of the reports have been in pediatric patients. Patients (especially pediatric patients) treated with topiramate tablets should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather. Caution should be used when topiramate tablet is given with other drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders; these drugs include, but are not limited to, other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and drugs with anticholinergic activity. 5.4 Metabolic Acidosis Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate. Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and \u2265 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo. Manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures [see Warnings and Precautions ( . A one-year, active-controlled study of pediatric patients treated with topiramate demonstrated that topiramate 5.9 , 5.13 )] decreased lumbar spine bone mineral density and that this lumbar spine bone mineral density decrease was correlated (using change from baseline for lumbar spine Z score at final visit versus lowest post-treatment serum bicarbonate) with decreased serum bicarbonate, a reflection of metabolic acidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( . Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates, which may decrease the maximal height achieved. Long-term, open-label treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 24 months old with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients with epilepsy are likely to have different growth rates than normal 1 to 24 month old pediatrics. Reductions in length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis 5.9 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Topiramate treatment that causes metabolic acidosis during pregnancy can possibly produce adverse effects on the fetus and might also cause metabolic acidosis in the neonate from possible transfer of topiramate to the fetus 8.4 )] [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.7 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] Measurement of Serum Bicarbonate in Epilepsy and Migraine Patients Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during topiramate treatment is recommended. If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing topiramate (using dose tapering). If the decision is made to continue patients on topiramate in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali treatment should be considered. 5.5 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including topiramate, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 4: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing topiramate or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. 5.6 Cognitive/Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Topiramate can cause cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions. The most frequent of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) Cognitive-related dysfunction (e.g., confusion, psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, speech or language problems, particularly word-finding difficulties); 2) Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression or mood problems); and 3) Somnolence or fatigue. Adult Patients Cognitive-Related Dysfunction Rapid titration rate and higher initial dose were associated with higher incidences of cognitive-related dysfunction. In adult epilepsy adjunctive controlled trials, which used rapid titration (100-200 mg/day weekly increments), and target topiramate doses of 200 mg - 1000 mg/day, 56% of patients in the 800 mg/day and 1000 mg/day dose groups experienced cognitive-related dysfunction compared to approximately 42% of patients in the 200-400 mg/day groups and 14% for placebo. In this rapid titration regimen, these dose-related adverse reactions began in the titration or in the maintenance phase, and in some patients these events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase. In the monotherapy epilepsy controlled trial, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg/day and 26% for 400 mg/day. In the 6-month controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine, which used a slower titration regimen (25 mg/day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg/day, 22% for 100 mg/day (the recommended dose), 28% for 200 mg/day, and 10% for placebo. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted after completion of titration. Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g., depression, mood) were dose-related for both the adjunctive epilepsy and migraine populations [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Somnolence/Fatigue Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of topiramate for adjunctive epilepsy. For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of fatigue, appeared dose related. For the monotherapy epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related. For the migraine population, the incidences of both fatigue and somnolence were dose-related and more common in the titration phase. Pediatric Patients In pediatric epilepsy trials (adjunctive and monotherapy), the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was generally lower than that observed in adults. These reactions included psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, speech disorders/related speech problems, and language problems. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients during adjunctive therapy double-blind studies were somnolence and fatigue. The most frequently reported cognitive/neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric epilepsy patients in the 50 mg/day and 400 mg/day groups during the monotherapy double-blind study were headache, dizziness, anorexia, and somnolence. In pediatric migraine patients, the incidence of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was increased in topiramate-treated patients compared to placebo. The risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was dose-dependent, and was greatest at the highest dose (200 mg). This risk for cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions was also greater in younger patients (6 to 11 years of age) than in older patients (12 to 17 years of age). The most common cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reaction in these trials was difficulty with concentration/attention. Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed during titration and sometimes persisted for various durations after completion of titration. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was administered to adolescents (12 to 17 years) to assess the effects of topiramate on cognitive function at baseline and at the end of the Study 13 [see Clinical Studies ( . Mean change from baseline in certain CANTAB tests suggests that topiramate treatment may result in psychomotor slowing and decreased verbal fluency. 14.3 )] 5.7 Fetal Toxicity Topiramate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Data from pregnancy registries indicate that infants exposed to topiramate in utero have an increased risk of major congenital malformations, including but not limited to cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), and of being small for gestational age (SGA). When multiple species of pregnant animals received topiramate at clinically relevant doses, structural malformations, including craniofacial defects, and reduced fetal weights occurred in offspring [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] Consider the benefits and the risks of topiramate when administering this drug in women of childbearing potential, particularly when topiramate is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ), Patient Counseling Information ( . Topiramate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus 17 )] [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] 5.8 Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs In patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs, including topiramate, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency [see Clinical Studies ( . In situations where rapid withdrawal of topiramate is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended. 14 )] 5.9 Decrease in Bone Mineral Density Results of a one-year active-controlled study in pediatric patients (N=63) demonstrated negative effects of topiramate monotherapy on bone mineral acquisition via statistically significant decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) measured in lumbar spine and in total body less head [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Twenty-one percent of topiramate-treated patients experienced clinically important reductions in BMD (Z score change from baseline of \u20130.5 or greater) compared to 0 patients in the control group. Although decreases in BMD occurred across all pediatric age subgroups, patients 6 to 9 years of age were most commonly affected. The sample size and study duration were too small to determine if fracture risk is increased. Decreased BMD in the lumbar spine was correlated with decreased serum bicarbonate, which commonly occurs with topiramate treatment and reflects metabolic acidosis, a known cause of increased bone resorption 8.4 )] [see Warnings and Precautions ( . Although small decreases in some markers of bone metabolism (e.g., serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) occurred in topiramate-treated patients, more significant decreases in serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, hormones involved in bone metabolism, were observed, along with an increased excretion of urinary calcium 5.4 )] 5.10 Negative Effects on the Growth (Height and Weight) Results of a one-year active-controlled study of pediatric patients (N=63) demonstrated negative effects of topiramate monotherapy on growth (i.e., height and weight) [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Although continued growth was observed in both treatment groups, the topiramate group showed statistically significant reductions in mean annual change from baseline in body weight compared to the control group. A similar trend of attenuation in height velocity and height change from baseline was also observed in the topiramate 8.4 )] group compared to the control group. Negative effects on weight and height were seen across all topiramate age subgroups. Growth (height and weight) of children receiving prolonged topiramate therapy should be carefully monitored 5.11 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome [SJS] and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis [TEN]) have been reported in patients receiving topiramate. Topiramate should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. Inform patients about the signs of serious skin reactions. 5.12 Hyperammonemia and Encephalopathy (Without and With Concomitant Valproic Acid Use) Topiramate treatment can cause hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy [see Adverse Reactions ( . The risk for hyperammonemia with topiramate appears dose-related. Hyperammonemia has been reported more frequently when topiramate is used concomitantly with valproic acid. Postmarketing cases of hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy have been reported with topiramate and valproic acid in patients who previously tolerated either drug alone 6.2 )] [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 )] Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy and/or vomiting. In most cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy abated with discontinuation of treatment. The incidence of hyperammonemia in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in the preventive treatement of migraine trials was 26% in patients taking topiramate monotherapy at 100 mg/day, and 14% in patients taking topiramate at 50 mg/day, compared to 9% in patients taking placebo. There was also an increased incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia at the 100 mg dose. Dose-related hyperammonemia was also seen in pediatric patients 1 to 24 months of age treated with topiramate and concomitant valproic acid for partial-onset epilepsy and this was not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. In some patients, hyperammonemia can be asymptomatic. Monitoring for Hyperammonemia Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy. Although not studied, topiramate treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting or changes in mental status associated with any topiramate treatment, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. 5.13 Kidney Stones Topiramate increases the risk of kidney stones. During adjunctive epilepsy trials, the risk for kidney stones in topiramate-treated adults was 1.5%, an incidence about 2 to 4 times greater than expected in a similar, untreated population. As in the general population, the incidence of stone formation among topiramate-treated patients was higher in men. Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking topiramate for epilepsy or migraine. During long-term (up to 1 year) topiramate treatment in an open-label extension study of 284 pediatric patients 1-24 months old with epilepsy, 7% developed kidney or bladder stones. Topiramate is not approved for treatment of epilepsy in pediatric patients less than 2 years old [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Topiramate is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and by increasing urinary pH [see Warnings and Precautions ( . The concomitant use of topiramate with any other drug producing metabolic acidosis, or potentially in patients on a ketogenic diet, may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of kidney stone formation, and should therefore be avoided. 5.4 )] Increased fluid intake increases the urinary output, lowering the concentration of substances involved in stone formation. Hydration is recommended to reduce new stone formation. An increase in urinary calcium and a marked decrease in urinary citrate was observed in topiramate-treated pediatric patients in a one-year active-controlled study [see Use in Specific Populations ( . This increased ratio of urinary calcium/citrate increases the risk of kidney stones and/or nephrocalcinosis. 8.4 )] 5.14 Hypothermia with Concomitant Valproic Acid Use Hypothermia, defined as a drop in body core temperature to <35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F), has been reported in association with topiramate use with concomitant valproic acid both in conjunction with hyperammonemia and in the absence of hyperammonemia. This adverse reaction in patients using concomitant topiramate and valproate can occur after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate [see Drug Interactions ( . Consideration should be given to stopping topiramate or valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels. 7.1 )]",

Monotherapy Epilepsy Adults 16 Years of Age and Older The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in adults in the 400\u00a0mg/day topiramate group and at an incidence higher ( > 10 %) than in the 50 mg/day group were: paresthesia, weight loss and anorexia (see Table 5). Approximately 21% of the 159 adult patients in the 400 mg/day group who received topiramate as monotherapy in Study 1 discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. The most common ( > 2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day topiramate) adverse reactions causing discontinuation were difficulty with memory, fatigue, asthenia, insomnia, somnolence, and paresthesia. Pediatric Patients 6 to 15 Years of Age The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial (Study 1) that occurred in pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day topiramate group and at an incidence higher ( > 10%) than in the 50 mg/day group were fever and weight loss (see Table 5). Approximately 14% of the 77 pediatric patients in the 400 mg/day group who received topiramate as monotherapy in the controlled clinical trial discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. The most common ( > 2% more frequent than low-dose 50 mg/day topiramate) adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation were difficulty with concentration/attention, fever, flushing, and confusion. Table 5 presents the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of adult and pediatric patients treated with 400 mg/day topiramate and occurring with greater incidence than 50 mg/day topiramate.

Patients in these trials were receiving 1 to 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs in addition to topiramate or placebo. The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial that occurred in adult patients in the 200-400 mg/day topiramate group with an incidence higher (\u2265 10%) than in the placebo group were: dizziness, speech disorders/related speech problems, somnolence, nervousness, psychomotor slowing, and vision abnormal (Table 6). Table 6 presents the incidence of adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of adult patients treated with 200 to 400 mg/day topiramate and was greater than placebo incidence. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., fatigue, dizziness, paresthesia, language problems, psychomotor slowing, depression, difficulty with concentration/attention, mood problems) was dose-related and much greater at higher than recommended topiramate dosing (i.e., 600 mg \u2013 1000 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (200 mg to 400 mg daily) range.

In controlled clinical trials in adults, 11% of patients receiving topiramate 200 to 400 mg/day as adjunctive therapy discontinued due to adverse reactions. This rate appeared to increase at dosages above 400 mg/day. Adverse reactions associated with discontinuing topiramate included somnolence, dizziness, anxiety, difficulty with concentration or attention, fatigue and paresthesia. Pediatric Patients 2 to 15 Years of Age In pooled, controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients (2 to 15 years of age) with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 98 patients received adjunctive therapy with topiramate at dosages of 5 to 9 mg/kg/day (recommended dose range) and 101 patients received placebo. The most common adverse reactions in the controlled clinical trial that occurred in pediatric patients in the 5 mg to 9 mg/kg/day topiramate group with an incidence higher (\u2265 10 %) than in the placebo group were: fatigue and somnolence (Table 7). Table 7 presents the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of pediatric patients 2 to 15 years of age receiving 5 mg to 9 mg/kg/day (recommended dose range) of topiramate and was greater than placebo incidence.

Patients may have reported more than one adverse reaction during the study and can be included in more than one adverse reaction category. None of the pediatric patients who received topiramate adjunctive therapy at 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in controlled clinical trials discontinued due to adverse reactions. Migraine Adults In the four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group migraine clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine (which included 35 pediatric patients 12 to 15 years of age), most adverse reactions occurred more frequently during the titration period than during the maintenance period. The most common adverse reactions with topiramate 100 mg in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine of predominantly adults that were seen at an incidence higher (\u2265 5 %) than in the placebo group were: paresthesia, anorexia, weight loss, taste perversion, diarrhea, difficulty with memory, hypoesthesia, and nausea (see Table 8). Table 8 includes those adverse reactions that occurred in the placebo-controlled trials where the incidence in any topiramate treatment group was at least 3% and was greater than that for placebo patients. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., fatigue, dizziness, somnolence, difficulty with memory, difficulty with concentration/attention) was dose-related and greater at higher than recommended topiramate dosing (200 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (100 mg daily).

The adverse reactions associated with discontinuing therapy in the topiramate-treated patients included paresthesia (7%), fatigue (4%), nausea (4%), difficulty with concentration/attention (3%), insomnia (3%), anorexia (2%), and dizziness (2%). Patients treated with topiramate experienced mean percent reductions in body weight that were dose-dependent. This change was not seen in the placebo group. Mean changes of 0%, -2%, -3%, and -4% were seen for the placebo group, topiramate 50, 100, and 200 mg groups, respectively. Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age In five, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine, most adverse reactions occurred more frequently during the titration period than during the maintenance period. Among adverse reactions with onset during titration, approximately half persisted into the maintenance period. In four, fixed-dose, double-blind clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine in topiramate -treated pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, the most common adverse reactions with topiramate 100 mg that were seen at an incidence higher (\u22655%) than in the placebo group were: paresthesia, upper respiratory tract infection, anorexia, and abdominal pain (see Table 9). Table 9 shows adverse reactions from the pediatric trial (Study 13 [see Clinical Studies ( ) in which 103 pediatric patients were treated with placebo or 50 mg or 100 mg of topiramate, and three predominantly adult trials in which 49 pediatric patients (12 to 17 years of age) were treated with placebo or 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg of topiramate. Table 9 also shows adverse reactions in pediatric patients in the controlled migraine trials when the incidence in a topiramate dose group was at least 5 % or higher and greater than the incidence of placebo. Many adverse reactions shown in Table 9 indicate a dose-dependent relationship. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., allergy, fatigue, headache, anorexia, insomnia, somnolence, and viral infection) was dose-related and greater at higher than recommended topiramate dosing (200 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (100 mg daily). 14.3 )] Table 9: Adverse Reactions in Pooled Double-Blind Studies for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age a, b, c a 35 adolescent patients aged 12 to <16 years were also included in adverse reaction assessment for adults (Tables 11 and 12) b Incidence is based on the number of subjects experiencing at least 1 adverse event, not the number of events. c Included studies MIG-3006, MIGR-001, MIGR-002 and MIGR-003 Body System / Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=45) % Topiramate Dosage 50 mg/day (N=46) % 100 mg/day (N=48) % Body as a Whole \u2013 General Disorders Fatigue 7 7 8 Fever 2 4 6 Central & Peripheral Nervous System Disorders Paresthesia 7 20 19 Dizziness 4 4 6 Gastrointestinal System Disorders Abdominal pain 9 7 15 Nausea 4 4 8 Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Weight loss 2 7 4 Psychiatric Disorders Anorexia 4 9 10 Somnolence 2 2 6 Insomnia 2 9 2 Resistance Mechanism Disorders Infection viral 4 4 8 Respiratory System Disorders Upper respiratory tract infection 11 26 23 Rhinitis 2 7 6 Sinusitis 2 9 4 Coughing 0 7 2 Special Senses Other, Disorders Taste perversion 2 2 6 Vision Disorders Conjunctivitis 4 7 4 In the double-blind placebo-controlled studies, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 8% of placebo patients compared with 6% of topiramate-treated patients. Adverse reactions associated with discontinuing therapy that occurred in more than one topiramate-treated patient were fatigue (1%), headache (1%), and somnolence (1%). Increased Risk for Bleeding Topiramate is associated with an increased risk for bleeding. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled studies of approved and unapproved indications, bleeding was more frequently reported as an adverse reaction for topiramate than for placebo (4.5% versus 3.0% in adult patients, and 4.4% versus 2.3% in pediatric patients). In this analysis, the incidence of serious bleeding events for topiramate and placebo was 0.3% versus 0.2% for adult patients, and 0.4% versus 0% for pediatric patients. Adverse bleeding reactions reported with topiramate ranged from mild epistaxis, ecchymosis, and increased menstrual bleeding to life-threatening hemorrhages. In patients with serious bleeding events, conditions that increased the risk for bleeding were often present, or patients were often taking drugs that cause thrombocytopenia (other antiepileptic drugs) or affect platelet function or coagulation (e.g., aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or warfarin or other anticoagulants). Other Adverse Reactions Observed During Clinical Trials Other adverse reactions seen during clinical trials were: abnormal coordination, eosinophilia, gingival bleeding, hematuria, hypotension, myalgia, myopia, postural hypotension, scotoma, suicide attempt, syncope, and visual field defect. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Adult Patients In addition to changes in serum bicarbonate (i.e., metabolic acidosis), sodium chloride and ammonia, topiramate was associated with changes in several clinical laboratory analytes in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [see Warnings and Precautions ( Controlled trials of adjunctive topiramate treatment of adults for partial-onset seizures showed an increased incidence of markedly decreased serum phosphorus (6% topiramate versus 2% placebo), markedly increased serum alkaline phosphatase (3% topiramate versus 1% placebo), and decreased serum potassium (0.4 % topiramate versus 0.1 % placebo). 5.4 , 5.10 )]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients (1-24 months) receiving adjunctive topiramate for partial-onset seizures, there was an increased incidence for an increased result (relative to normal analyte reference range) associated with topiramate (vs placebo) for the following clinical laboratory analytes: creatinine, BUN, alkaline phosphatase, and total protein, The incidence was also increased for a decreased result for bicarbonate (i.e., metabolic acidosis), and potassium with topiramate (vs placebo) [see Use in Specific Populations ( Topiramate is not indicated for partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. 8.4 )]. In pediatric patients (ranging from 6-17 years of age) receiving topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine, there was an increased incidence for an increased result (relative to normal analyte reference range) associated with topiramate (vs placebo) for the following clinical laboratory analytes: creatinine, BUN, uric acid, chloride, ammonia, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, platelets, and eosinophils, The incidence was also increased for a decreased result for phosphorus, bicarbonate, total white blood count, and neutrophils [see Use in Specific Populations ( )]. Topiramate is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age. 8.4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of topiramate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole-General Disorders : oligohydrosis and hyperthermia [see Warnings and Precautions ( , hyperammonemia, hyperammonemic encephalopathy 5.3 )] [see Warnings and Precautions ( hypothermia with concomitant valproic acid 5.12 )], [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.14 )] Gastrointestinal System Disorders : hepatic failure (including fatalities), hepatitis, pancreatitis Skin and Appendage Disorders : bullous skin reactions (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) [see Warnings and Precautions ( , pemphigus 5.11 )] Urinary System Disorders : kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 , 5.13 )] Vision Disorders : acute myopia, secondary angle closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions ( , maculopathy 5.1 )] Hematological Disorders : decrease of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time when given concomitantly with vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant medications such as warfarin.",
