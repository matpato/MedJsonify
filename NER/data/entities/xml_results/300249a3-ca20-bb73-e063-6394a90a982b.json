    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Silver Sulfadiazine Cream is a topical antimicrobial drug indicated as\n                     an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of wound sepsis in patients with\n                     second and third degree burns.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Silver Sulfadiazine Cream is contraindicated in patients who are\n                     hypersensitive to silver sulfadiazine or any of the other ingredients in the\n                     preparation. Because sulfonamide therapy is known to increase the possibility of\n                     kernicterus, Silver Sulfadiazine Cream should not be used on pregnant women\n                     approaching or at term, on premature infants, or on newborn infants during the\n                     first 2 months of life.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNING There is a potential cross-sensitivity between silver sulfadiazine and\n                     other sulfonamides.\u00a0 If allergic reactions attributable to treatment with\n                     silver sulfadiazine occur, continuation of therapy must be weighed against the\n                     potential hazards of the particular allergic reaction. Fungal proliferation in and below the eschar may occur.\u00a0 However, the\n                     incidence of clinically reported fungal superinfection is low. The use of Silver Sulfadiazine Cream in some cases of\n                     glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals may be hazardous, as\n                     hemolysis may occur.PRECAUTION If hepatic and renal functions become impaired and elimination of the\n                     drug decreases accumulation may occur and discontinuation of Silver\n                     Sulfadiazine Cream should be weighed against the therapeutic benefit being\n                     achieved. In considering the use of topical proteolytic enzymes in conjunction\n                     with Silver Sulfadiazine Cream, the possibility should be noted that silver may\n                     inactivate such enzymes. Laboratory Tests: In the treatment\n                     of burn wounds involving extensive areas of the body, the serum sulfa\n                     concentrations may approach adult therapeutic levels (8 to 12mg %).\u00a0 Therefore,\n                     in these patients it would be advisable to monitor serum sulfa concentrations.\u00a0\n                     Renal function should be carefully monitored and the urine should be checked\n                     for sulfa crystals. Absorption of the propylene glycol vehicle has been reported to affect\n                     serum osmolality, which may affect the interpretation of laboratory tests.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leucopenia have been reported in patients\n                     receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy.\u00a0 Leucopenia associated with silver\n                     sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil\n                     count.\u00a0 Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of\n                     initiation of therapy.\u00a0 Rebound to normal leukocyte levels follows onset within\n                     two to three days.\u00a0 Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver\n                     sulfadiazine therapy.\u00a0 The incidence of leucopenia in various reports averages\n                     about 20%.\u00a0 A higher incidence has been seen in patients treated concurrently\n                     with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema\n                     multiforme, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial\n                     nephritis.\u00a0 Reduction in bacterial growth after application of topical\n                     antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep\n                     partial thickness burns by preventing conversion of the partial thickness to\n                     full thickness by sepsis.\u00a0 However, reduction in bacterial colonization has\n                     caused delayed separation, in some cases necessitating escharotomy in order to\n                     prevent contracture. Absorption of silver sulfadiazine varies depending upon the percent of\n                     body surface area and the extent of the tissue damage.\u00a0 Although few have been\n                     reported, it is possible that any adverse reaction associated with sulfonamides\n                     may occur.\u00a0 Some of the reactions which have been associated with sulfonamides\n                     are as follows: blood dyscrasias, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia,\n                     thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, hemolytic anemia, dermatologic reactions,\n                     allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis,\n                     gastrointestinal reactions, hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, CNS reactions,\n                     and toxic nephrosis.",
