    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions: If hypersensitivity occurs, consider discontinuing AJOVY and institute appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Hypertension:\u00a0New-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension may occur. ( 5.2 ) Raynaud's Phenomenon:\u00a0New-onset or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon may occur. ( 5.3 ) 5.1\u00a0 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, drug hypersensitivity, and urticaria, were reported with AJOVY in clinical trials. Most reactions were mild to moderate, but some led to discontinuation or required corticosteroid treatment. Most reactions were reported from within hours to one month after administration. Cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported in the postmarketing setting. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, consider discontinuing AJOVY, and institute appropriate therapy [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] 5.2\u00a0 Hypertension Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of CGRP antagonists, including AJOVY, in the postmarketing setting. Some of the patients who developed new-onset hypertension had risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring initiation of pharmacological treatment for hypertension and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment, but was most frequently reported within 7 days of therapy initiation. AJOVY was discontinued in many of the reported cases. Monitor patients treated with AJOVY for new-onset hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of AJOVY is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology or blood pressure is inadequately controlled. 5.3\u00a0 Raynaud's Phenomenon Development of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including AJOVY. In reported cases with monoclonal antibody CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 71 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms. AJOVY should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon develop and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and greater than placebo) were injection site reactions. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-483-8279 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety of AJOVY was evaluated in 2512 patients with migraine who received at least 1 dose of AJOVY, representing 1279 patient-years of exposure. Of these, 1730 patients were exposed to AJOVY 225 mg monthly or AJOVY 675 mg quarterly for at least 6 months, 775 patients for at least 12 months, and 138 patients for at least 15 months. In placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies 1 and 2), 662 patients received AJOVY 225 mg monthly for 12 weeks (with or without a loading dose of 675 mg), and 663 patients received AJOVY 675 mg quarterly for 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( . In the controlled trials, 87% of patients were female, 80% were White, and the mean age was 41 years. 14 )] The most common adverse reactions in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine (incidence at least 5% and greater than placebo) were injection site reactions. The adverse reactions that most commonly led to discontinuations were injection site reactions (1%). Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in the 3-month placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2), and the 1-month follow-up period after those studies. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring with an Incidence of At Least 2% for Either Dosing Regimen of AJOVY and At Least 2% Greater Than Placebo in Studies 1 and 2 Adverse Reaction AJOVY 225 mg Monthly (n=290) % AJOVY 675 mg Quarterly (n=667) % Placebo Monthly (n=668) % Injection site reactions a 43 45 38 a Injection site reactions include multiple related adverse event terms, such as injection site pain, induration, and erythema. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to fremanezumab-vfrm in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies to other products may be misleading. Clinical immunogenicity of AJOVY was monitored by analyzing anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies in drug-treated patients. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to AJOVY in specific assays. In 3-month placebo-controlled studies, treatment-emergent ADA responses were observed in 6 out of 1701 (0.4%) AJOVY-treated patients. One of the 6 patients developed anti-AJOVY neutralizing antibodies at Day 84. In the ongoing long-term open-label study, ADA were detected in 1.6% of patients (30 out of 1888). Out of 30 ADA-positive patients, 17 had a neutralizing activity in their post-dose samples. Although these data do not demonstrate an impact of anti-fremanezumab-vfrm antibody development on the efficacy or safety of AJOVY in these patients, the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of AJOVY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
