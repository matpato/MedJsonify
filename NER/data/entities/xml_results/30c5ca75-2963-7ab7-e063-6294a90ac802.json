    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Never share a Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen between patients, even if the needle is changed (5.1) . Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen: Make changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring (5.2) . Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to: insulin dosage, concomitantly administered glucose lowering medications, meal pattern, physical activity; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairments and hypoglycemia unawareness (5.3) . Medication Errors: Accidental mix-ups between insulin products can occur. Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection (5.4) . Hypersensitivity reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30, treat, and monitor, if indicated (5.5) . Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated (5.6) . Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs (5.7) . 5.1 Never Share Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 FlexPen Between Patients Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) FlexPen should never be shared between patients, even if the needle is changed. Patients using Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart vials must never share needles or syringes with another person. Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens. 5.2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen (e.g., insulin strength, manufacturer, type, injection site or method of administration) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( or hyperglycemia. Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia; and a sudden change in the injection site (to an unaffected area) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia 5.3) ] [see Adverse Reactions ( Make any changes to a patient\u2019s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring. Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia. For patients with type 2 diabetes, dosage adjustments of concomitant anti-diabetic products may be needed. 6.1 , 6.3 )]. 5.3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery). Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers) [see Drug Interactions ( , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. 7 )] Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal. As with all insulins, the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to concomitantly administered medication 12.2 )] [see Drug Interactions ( . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia 7 )] [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 )]. Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia; increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix-ups between insulin products have been reported. To avoid medication errors between this Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart product and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [see Adverse Reactions ( Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin aspart or one of the excipients 6 )]. [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 5.6 Hypokalemia All insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentration). 5.7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere: Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Adverse reactions observed with insulin therapy include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash and pruritus (6) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Pharma, Inc. at 1-800-727-6500 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs, therefore, the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial, and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice. The data in: Table 1 reflects the exposure of 55 patients with type 1 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 (referred to as Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart ) with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 43 years old. Sixty-four percent were male and 100% were White. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Table 2 reflects the exposure of 85 patients with type 2 diabetes to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with a mean exposure duration of three months. The mean age was 63 years old. Fifty-four percent were male and 100% were White. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.1 kg/m 2 . The mean duration of diabetes was 15 years. Common adverse reactions were defined as events that occurred in \u22655%, excluding hypoglycemia, of the population studied. Common adverse reactions that occurred for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart-treated patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The trial was a three-month, open-label trial in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were treated twice daily (before breakfast and before supper) with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Table 1: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients Treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (n=55) Preferred Term N % Hypoglycemia 38 69 Headache 19 35 Influenza-like symptoms 7 13 Dyspepsia 5 9 Back pain 4 7 Diarrhea 4 7 Pharyngitis 4 7 Rhinitis 3 5 Skeletal pain 3 5 Upper respiratory tract infection 3 5 Table 2: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in \u2265 5% of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Adult Patients Treated with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart (n=85) Preferred Term N % Hypoglycemia 40 47 Upper respiratory tract infection 10 12 Headache 8 9 Diarrhea 7 8 Neuropathy 7 8 Pharyngitis 5 6 Abdominal pain 4 5 Rhinitis 4 5 Severe Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients using insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used, diabetes type, insulin dose, intensity of glucose control, background therapies, and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors. For these reasons, comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also, may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice. Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and/or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin, including trials with Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients receiving subcutaneous Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart was 16% and 4% for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients respectively at 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] Allergic Reactions Patients have experienced reactions such as erythema, edema or pruritus at the site of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart injection. These reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks, but in some occasions, have required discontinuation of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Severe cases of generalized allergy (anaphylaxis) have been reported. Adverse Reactions Associated with Insulin Initiation and Glucose Control Intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Lipodystrophy Long-term use of insulin, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections. Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissue), and may affect insulin absorption [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Weight Gain Weight gain can occur with insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glycosuria. Peripheral Edema Insulins, including Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In a 3-month study with an extension in adult patients with type 2 diabetes, 100% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study including 91.4% that were positive at baseline. A total of 91.4% of patients who received Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at least once during the first 12 months of the study, including 62.1% that were positive at baseline. In a type 2 diabetes clinical trial of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart, initial increase in titers of antibodies to insulin followed by a decrease approaching to baseline values was observed in Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart and Novolin 70/30 treatment groups with similar incidences. These antibodies did not cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate increases in insulin dose. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Aspart Protamine and Insulin Aspart have been reported. Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred with insulin aspart. Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site.",
