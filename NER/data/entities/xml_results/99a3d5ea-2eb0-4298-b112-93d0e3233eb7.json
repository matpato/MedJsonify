    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema (e.g., swelling of the throat, head and neck) can occur, and may be associated with life-threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Discontinue pregabalin capsules immediately in these cases. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea, and wheezing) can occur. Discontinue pregabalin capsules immediately in these patients. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Antiepileptic drugs, including pregabalin capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression: May occur with pregabalin capsules, when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Monitor patients and adjust dosage as appropriate. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Pregabalin capsules may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients\u2019 ability to drive or operate machinery. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Increased seizure frequency or other adverse reactions may occur if pregabalin capsules are rapidly discontinued. Withdraw pregabalin capsules gradually over a minimum of 1 week. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Pregabalin capsules may cause peripheral edema. Exercise caution when co-administering pregabalin capsules and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Angioedema There have been postmarketing reports of angioedema in patients during initial and chronic treatment with pregabalin capsules. Specific symptoms included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), and neck (throat and larynx). There were reports of life-threatening angioedema with respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Discontinue pregabalin capsules immediately in patients with these symptoms. Exercise caution when prescribing pregabalin capsules to patients who have had a previous episode of angioedema. In addition, patients who are taking other drugs associated with angioedema (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-inhibitors]) may be at increased risk of developing angioedema. 5.2 Hypersensitivity There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity in patients shortly after initiation of treatment with pregabalin capsules. Adverse reactions included skin redness, blisters, hives, rash, dyspnea, and wheezing. Discontinue pregabalin capsules immediately in patients with these symptoms. 5.3 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including pregabalin capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Monitor patients treated with any AED for any indication for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of\u00a011 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 3. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. 5.4 Respiratory Depression There is evidence from case reports, human studies, and animal studies associating pregabalin capsules with serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression when co-administered with central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including opioids, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. When the decision is made to co-prescribe pregabalin capsules with another CNS depressant, particularly an opioid, or to prescribe pregabalin capsules to patients with underlying respiratory impairment, monitor patients for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and consider initiating pregabalin capsules at a low dose. The management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and reduction or withdrawal of CNS depressants (including pregabalin capsules). There is more limited evidence from case reports, animal studies, and human studies associating pregabalin capsules with serious respiratory depression, without co-administered CNS depressants or without underlying respiratory impairment. 5.5 Dizziness and Somnolence Pregabalin capsules may cause dizziness and somnolence. Inform patients that pregabalin capsules-related dizziness and somnolence may impair their ability to perform tasks such as driving or operating machinery [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. In the pregabalin capsules controlled trials in adult patients, dizziness was experienced by 30% of pregabalin capsules-treated patients compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients; somnolence was experienced by 23% of pregabalin capsules-treated patients compared to 8% of placebo-treated patients. Dizziness and somnolence generally began shortly after the initiation of pregabalin capsules therapy and occurred more frequently at higher doses. Dizziness and somnolence were the adverse reactions most frequently leading to withdrawal (4% each) from controlled studies. In pregabalin capsules-treated patients reporting these adverse reactions in short-term, controlled studies, dizziness persisted until the last dose in 30% and somnolence persisted until the last dose in 42% of patients [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. In the pregabalin capsules controlled trials in pediatric patients 4 to less than 17 years of age and 1 month to less than 4 years of age for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, somnolence was reported in 21% and 15% of pregabalin capsules-treated patients compared to 14% and 9% of placebo-treated patients, respectively, and occurred more frequently at higher doses. For patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age, somnolence includes related terms lethargy, sluggishness, and hypersomnia. 5.6 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation As with all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), withdraw pregabalin capsules gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders. Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin capsules, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea. If pregabalin capsules are discontinued, taper the drug gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinue the drug abruptly. 5.7 Peripheral Edema Pregabalin capsules treatment may cause peripheral edema. In short-term trials of patients without clinically significant heart or peripheral vascular disease, there was no apparent association between peripheral edema and cardiovascular complications such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Peripheral edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function. In controlled clinical trials in adult patients, the incidence of peripheral edema was 6% in the pregabalin capsules group compared with 2% in the placebo group. In controlled clinical trials, 0.5% of pregabalin capsules patients and 0.2% placebo patients withdrew due to peripheral edema. Higher frequencies of weight gain and peripheral edema were observed in patients taking both pregabalin capsules and a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent compared to patients taking either drug alone. The majority of patients using thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents in the overall safety database were participants in studies of pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In this population, peripheral edema was reported in 3% (2/60) of patients who were using thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents only, 8% (69/859) of patients who were treated with pregabalin capsules only, and 19% (23/120) of patients who were on both pregabalin capsules and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents. Similarly, weight gain was reported in 0% (0/60) of patients on thiazolidinediones only; 4% (35/859) of patients on pregabalin capsules only; and 7.5% (9/120) of patients on both drugs. As the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs can cause weight gain and/or fluid retention, possibly exacerbating or leading to heart failure, exercise caution when co-administering pregabalin capsules and these agents. Because there are limited data on congestive heart failure patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV cardiac status, exercise caution when using pregabalin capsules in these patients. 5.8 Weight Gain Pregabalin capsules treatment may cause weight gain. In pregabalin capsules controlled clinical trials in adult patients of up to 14 weeks, a gain of 7% or more over baseline weight was observed in 9% of pregabalin capsules-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Few patients treated with pregabalin capsules (0.3%) withdrew from controlled trials due to weight gain. Pregabalin capsules associated weight gain was related to dose and duration of exposure but did not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, gender, or age. Weight gain was not limited to patients with edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Although weight gain was not associated with clinically important changes in blood pressure in short-term controlled studies, the long-term cardiovascular effects of pregabalin capsules-associated weight gain are unknown. Among diabetic patients, pregabalin capsules-treated patients gained an average of 1.6 kg (range: -16 to 16 kg), compared to an average 0.3 kg (range: -10 to 9 kg) weight gain in placebo patients. In a cohort of 333 diabetic patients who received pregabalin capsules for at least 2 years, the average weight gain was 5.2 kg. While the effects of pregabalin capsules-associated weight gain on glycemic control have not been systematically assessed, in controlled and longer-term open label clinical trials with diabetic patients, pregabalin capsules treatment did not appear to be associated with loss of glycemic control (as measured by HbA 1C ). 5.9 Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies of pregabalin capsules, an unexpectedly high incidence of hemangiosarcoma was identified in two different strains of mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during pregabalin capsules premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. 13.1 )]. In clinical studies across various patient populations, comprising 6,396 patient-years of exposure in patients greater than 12 years of age, new or worsening-preexisting tumors were reported in 57 patients. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in similar populations not treated with pregabalin capsules, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in these cohorts is or is not affected by treatment. 5.10 Ophthalmological Effects In controlled studies in adult patients, a higher proportion of patients treated with pregabalin capsules reported blurred vision (7%) than did patients treated with placebo (2%), which resolved in a majority of cases with continued dosing. Less than 1% of patients discontinued pregabalin capsules treatment due to vision-related events (primarily blurred vision). Prospectively planned ophthalmologic testing, including visual acuity testing, formal visual field testing and dilated funduscopic examination, was performed in over 3,600 patients. In these patients, visual acuity was reduced in 7% of patients treated with pregabalin capsules, and 5% of placebo-treated patients. Visual field changes were detected in 13% of pregabalin capsules-treated, and 12% of placebo-treated patients. Funduscopic changes were observed in 2% of pregabalin capsules-treated and 2% of placebo-treated patients. Although the clinical significance of the ophthalmologic findings is unknown, inform patients to notify their physician if changes in vision occur. If visual disturbance persists, consider further assessment. Consider more frequent assessment for patients who are already routinely monitored for ocular conditions [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.11 Creatine Kinase Elevations Pregabalin capsules treatment was associated with creatine kinase elevations. Mean changes in creatine kinase from baseline to the maximum value were 60 U/L for pregabalin capsules-treated patients and 28 U/L for the placebo patients. In all controlled trials in adult patients across multiple patient populations, 1.5% of patients on pregabalin capsules and 0.7% of placebo patients had a value of creatine kinase at least three times the upper limit of normal. Three pregabalin capsules-treated subjects had events reported as rhabdomyolysis in premarketing clinical trials. The relationship between these myopathy events and pregabalin capsules is not completely understood because the cases had documented factors that may have caused or contributed to these events. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if these muscle symptoms are accompanied by malaise or fever. Discontinue treatment with pregabalin capsules if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected or if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur. 5.12 Decreased Platelet Count Pregabalin capsules treatment was associated with a decrease in platelet count. Pregabalin capsules-treated subjects experienced a mean maximal decrease in platelet count of 20 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL, compared to 11 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL in placebo patients. In the overall database of controlled trials in adult patients, 2% of placebo patients and 3% of pregabalin capsules patients experienced a potentially clinically significant decrease in platelets, defined as 20% below baseline value and less than 150 \u00d7 10 3 /\u03bcL. A single pregabalin capsules-treated subject developed severe thrombocytopenia with a platelet count less than 20 x 10 3 /\u03bcL. In randomized controlled trials, pregabalin capsules were not associated with an increase in bleeding-related adverse reactions. 5.13 PR Interval Prolongation Pregabalin capsules treatment was associated with PR interval prolongation. In analyses of clinical trial ECG data in adult patients, the mean PR interval increase was 3 to 6 msec at pregabalin capsules doses greater than or equal to 300 mg/day. This mean change difference was not associated with an increased risk of PR increase greater than or equal to 25% from baseline, an increased percentage of subjects with on-treatment PR greater than 200 msec, or an increased risk of adverse reactions of second or third degree AV block. Subgroup analyses did not identify an increased risk of PR prolongation in patients with baseline PR prolongation or in patients taking other PR prolonging medications. However, these analyses cannot be considered definitive because of the limited number of patients in these categories.",

In all controlled and uncontrolled trials across various patient populations during the premarketing development of pregabalin capsules, more than 10,000 patients have received pregabalin capsules. Approximately 5,000 patients were treated for 6 months or more, over 3,100 patients were treated for 1 year or longer, and over 1,400 patients were treated for at least 2 years. Adverse Reactions Most Commonly Leading to Discontinuation in All Premarketing Controlled Clinical Studies In premarketing controlled trials of all adult populations combined, 14% of patients treated with pregabalin capsules and 7% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the pregabalin capsules treatment group, the adverse reactions most frequently leading to discontinuation were dizziness (4%) and somnolence (4%). In the placebo group, 1% of patients withdrew due to dizziness and less than 1% withdrew due to somnolence. Other adverse reactions that led to discontinuation from controlled trials more frequently in the pregabalin capsules group compared to the placebo group were ataxia, confusion, asthenia, thinking abnormal, blurred vision, incoordination, and peripheral edema (1% each). Most Common Adverse Reactions in All Controlled Clinical Studies in Adults In premarketing controlled trials of all adult patient populations combined (including DPN, PHN, and adult patients with partial-onset seizures), dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain, and \"thinking abnormal\" (primarily difficulty with concentration/attention) were more commonly reported by subjects treated with pregabalin capsules than by subjects treated with placebo (greater than or equal to 5% and twice the rate of that seen in placebo). Controlled Studies with Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In clinical trials in adults with neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, 9% of patients treated with pregabalin capsules and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the pregabalin capsules treatment group, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were dizziness (3%) and somnolence (2%). In comparison, less than 1% of placebo patients withdrew due to dizziness and somnolence. Other reasons for discontinuation from the trials, occurring with greater frequency in the pregabalin capsules group than in the placebo group, were asthenia, confusion, and peripheral edema. Each of these events led to withdrawal in approximately 1% of patients. Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 4 lists all adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of patients with neuropathic pain associated with diabetic neuropathy in the combined pregabalin capsules group for which the incidence was greater in this combined pregabalin capsules group than in the placebo group.

In the pregabalin capsules treatment group, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were dizziness (4%) and somnolence (3%). In comparison, less than 1% of placebo patients withdrew due to dizziness and somnolence. Other reasons for discontinuation from the trials, occurring in greater frequency in the pregabalin capsules group than in the placebo group, were confusion (2%), as well as peripheral edema, asthenia, ataxia, and abnormal gait (1% each). Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 5 lists all adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring in greater than or equal to 1% of patients with neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia in the combined pregabalin capsules group for which the incidence was greater in this combined pregabalin capsules group than in the placebo group. In addition, an event is included, even if the incidence in the all pregabalin capsules group is not greater than in the placebo group, if the incidence of the event in the 600 mg/day group is more than twice that in the placebo group. A majority of pregabalin-treated patients in clinical studies had adverse reactions with a maximum intensity of \"mild\" or \"moderate\". Overall, 12.4% of all pregabalin-treated patients and 9.0% of all placebo-treated patients had at least one severe event while 8% of pregabalin-treated patients and 4.3% of placebo-treated patients had at least one severe treatment-related adverse event.

Other adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of at least 1% of patients in the pregabalin capsules group and at least twice as frequently compared to the placebo group were asthenia, diplopia, blurred vision, thinking abnormal, nausea, tremor, vertigo, headache, and confusion (which each led to withdrawal in 2% or less of patients). Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 6 lists all dose-related adverse reactions occurring in at least 2% of all pregabalin capsules-treated patients. Dose-relatedness was defined as the incidence of the adverse event in the 600 mg/day group was at least 2% greater than the rate in both the placebo and 150 mg/day groups. In these studies, 758 patients received pregabalin capsules and 294 patients received placebo for up to 12 weeks.

Events are categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse reactions are those occurring on one or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Events of major clinical importance are described in the Warnings and Precautions section ( 5 ).

There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse experience reports by race. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pregabalin capsules. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Nervous System Disorders \u2013 Headache Gastrointestinal Disorders \u2013 Nausea, Diarrhea Reproductive System and Breast Disorders \u2013 Gynecomastia, Breast Enlargement Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \u2013 Bullous pemphigoid There are postmarketing reports of life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression in patients taking pregabalin capsules with opioids or other CNS depressants, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. In addition, there are postmarketing reports of events related to reduced lower gastrointestinal tract function (e.g., intestinal obstruction, paralytic ileus, constipation) when pregabalin capsules were co-administered with medications that have the potential to produce constipation, such as opioid analgesics.",
