    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS LIVMARLI is contraindicated in patients with prior or active hepatic decompensation events (e.g., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Patients with prior or active hepatic decompensation events (e.g., variceal hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy). ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Obtain baseline liver tests and monitor patients  frequently for the first 6 to 8 months after starting therapy, and as clinically indicated thereafter during treatment. If liver test abnormalities or signs of clinical hepatitis occur, consider dose reduction or treatment interruption. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities relative to baseline, discontinue LIVMARLI. Monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis frequently. Permanently discontinue LIVMARLI if hepatic decompensation event occurs. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Consider reducing the dosage or interrupting LIVMARLI treatment if a patient experiences persistent diarrhea or abdominal pain, or has diarrhea with bloody stool, vomiting, dehydration requiring treatment, or fever. Consider stopping LIVMARLI treatment if diarrhea or abdominal pain persists and no alternate etiology is identified. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Fat-Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency: Obtain baseline levels and monitor during treatment. Supplement if deficiency is observed. If FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite FSV supplementation, consider discontinuing LIVMARLI treatment. ( 5.3 ) o Fracture: Consider interrupting LIVMARLI treatment and supplement with FSV. LIVMARLI can be restarted once FSV deficiency is corrected and maintained at corrected levels. o Bleeding: Interrupt treatment with LIVMARLI. Treatment can be restarted if the FSV deficiency is corrected and bleeding has resolved. \u2022 Risk of Propylene Glycol Toxicity (Pediatric Patients Less Than 5\u00a0years of Age): Total daily intake of propylene glycol should be considered for managing the risk of propylene glycol toxicity. Monitor patients for signs of propylene glycol toxicity. Discontinue if toxicity is suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1\tHepatotoxicity LIVMARLI treatment is associated with a potential for drug-induced liver injury. In the PFIC trial, treatment-emergent hepatic decompensation events and elevations of liver tests or worsening of liver tests occurred. Two patients experienced drug-induced liver injury (DILI) attributable to LIVMARLI. Two additional patients experienced DILI in the open-label extension portion of the trial. Of these four patients, one patient required liver transplant and another patient died. In the ALGS trial, treatment-emergent elevations of liver tests or worsening of liver tests occurred. Most abnormalities included elevations in ALT, AST, and/or TB/DB. One patient whose TB was elevated at baseline discontinued LIVMARLI after 28\u00a0weeks due to increased TB above baseline. Four patients had ALT increases that led to dose modification (n=1), dose interruption (n=2), or permanent discontinuation (n=2) of LIVMARLI during the long-term, open-label extension period [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Obtain baseline liver tests because some ALGS and PFIC patients have abnormal liver tests at baseline. Monitor patients frequently for the first 6 to 8 months after starting therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter during treatment with LIVMARLI. Monitor for elevations in liver tests, for the development of liver-related adverse reactions, and for physical signs of hepatic decompensation. If liver test abnormalities or signs of clinical hepatitis occur in the absence of other causes, consider dose reduction or treatment interruption. Permanently discontinue LIVMARLI if a patient experiences the following: \u2022 persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities, or \u2022 upon rechallenge, signs and symptoms consistent with clinical hepatitis, or \u2022 a hepatic decompensation event. The safety and effectiveness of LIVMARLI have not been established in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Monitor patients with compensated cirrhosis frequently and discontinue LIVMARLI if hepatic decompensation occurs. LIVMARLI is contraindicated in patients with prior or active hepatic decompensation events [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.2\tGastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Diarrhea and abdominal pain were reported as the most common adverse reactions in patients treated with LIVMARLI [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Consider reducing the dosage or interrupting LIVMARLI treatment if a patient experiences persistent diarrhea or abdominal pain, or has diarrhea with bloody stool, vomiting, dehydration requiring treatment, or fever. Consider stopping LIVMARLI treatment if diarrhea or abdominal pain persists and no alternate etiology is identified. Monitor for dehydration due to diarrhea and treat promptly. LIVMARLI was not evaluated in PFIC patients with chronic diarrhea requiring intravenous fluids. When diarrhea or abdominal pain resolves, restart LIVMARLI at the last tolerated dose and increase the dose as tolerated. Consider stopping LIVMARLI treatment if they recur upon re-challenge with LIVMARLI. 5.3\tFat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency LIVMARLI may adversely affect absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (FSV). FSV include vitamins A, D, E, and K (measured using INR levels). ALGS and PFIC patients can have FSV deficiency at baseline and are frequently supplemented with FSV. In ALGS patients in Trial 1, treatment-emergent FSV deficiency was reported in 3 (10%) patients during 48 weeks of treatment. In PFIC patients in Trial 2, treatment-emergent FSV deficiency (assessed biochemically) was reported in 13\u00a0(28%) of LIVMARLI-treated patients versus 16 (35%) of placebo-treated patients during 26 weeks of treatment. Bone Fracture Treatment-emergent bone fracture events have been observed more frequently with LIVMARLI-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients [see . If fracture occurs, consider interrupting LIVMARLI treatment and supplement with FSV. LIVMARLI can be restarted once FSV deficiency is corrected and maintained at corrected levels. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Bleeding If bleeding occurs, interrupt treatment with LIVMARLI. LIVMARLI can be restarted if FSV deficiency is corrected and bleeding has resolved. Obtain serum FSV levels prior to initiation of LIVMARLI and monitor the levels periodically during treatment, along with any clinical manifestations of FSV deficiency. Supplement with FSV if FSV deficiency is diagnosed. Consider discontinuing LIVMARLI if FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite adequate FSV supplementation. If complications of FSV deficiency occur, such as fracture or bleeding, consider interrupting LIVMARLI treatment and supplement with FSV. LIVMARLI can be restarted once FSV deficiency is corrected and maintained at corrected levels. 5.4\tRisk of Propylene Glycol Toxicity (Pediatric Patients Less Than 5 Years of Age) LIVMARLI oral solution contains propylene glycol. Patients less than 5 years of age are at highest risk for propylene glycol toxicity, and a safe level for propylene glycol exposure with repeated administration has not been established for pediatric patients less than 5 years of age. When LIVMARLI oral solution is administered at the dose (380 mcg/kg once daily) for treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with ALGS, the exposure to propylene glycol will be 14.6 mg/kg/day. When LIVMARLI oral solution is administered at the dose (570 mcg/kg twice daily) for treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with PFIC, the exposure to propylene glycol will be 21.9 mg/kg/day. The total daily intake of propylene glycol from all sources should be considered for managing the risk of propylene glycol toxicity. Monitor patients for signs of potential propylene glycol toxicity, including hemolysis, hyperosmolarity with anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, and CNS toxicity. Discontinue LIVMARLI oral solution if propylene glycol toxicity is suspected [see Overdosage (10) ].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Fat Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) are: \u2022 ALGS: diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, liver test abnormalities, and bone fractures.

ALGS: In the Alagille syndrome clinical development program, which includes five clinical studies comprising 86 patients, patients received doses of LIVMARLI up to 760 mcg/kg per day with a median duration of exposure of 32.3 months (range: 0.03 \u2013 60.9 months). In Trial 1, the 4-week placebo control period occurred after 18 weeks of LIVMARLI treatment. In two supportive studies that included long-term open\u2011label extensions, only 13 weeks of placebo-controlled treatment occurred which evaluated doses lower than 380 mcg/kg/day. The majority of LIVMARLI exposure in the development program occurred without a placebo control in open-label trial extensions. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) for ALGS patients treated with LIVMARLI are presented in Table 5 below. Treatment interruptions or dose reductions occurred in 5 (6%) patients due to diarrhea, abdominal pain, or vomiting. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u2265 5% of Patients Treated with LIVMARLI in the ALGS Clinical Development Program *Terms were defined as: Fat-Soluble Vitamin deficiency includes: A, D, E, or K deficiency, or INR increase Abdominal Pain includes : abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, abdominal pain upper Transaminases increased includes : ALT abnormal, ALT increased, AST abnormal, AST increased Bone Fracture includes: tibia fracture, rib fracture, hand fracture, humerus fracture, pathological fracture, forearm fracture, clavicle fracture 1 Exposure adjusted incidence rate for each adverse reaction type was calculated using the first occurrence of this adverse reaction per patient LIVMARLI (n=86) Adverse Reaction Any Grade n (%) Number of events per 100 person\u2011years 1 Diarrhea 48 (55.8%) 41.6 Abdominal pain* 46 (53.5%) 38.6 Vomiting 35 (40.7%) 19.8 Nausea 7 (8.1%) 2.9 Fat-Soluble Vitamin deficiency* 22 (25.6%) 11.1 Transaminases increased (ALT,\u00a0AST)* 16 (18.6%) 6.9 Bone Fractures* 8 (9.3%) 3.3 Liver Test Abnormalities Increase in Transaminases In a pooled analysis of patients with ALGS (N=86) administered LIVMARLI, increases in hepatic transaminases (ALT) were observed. Seven (8.1%) patients discontinued LIVMARLI due to ALT increases. Three (3.5%) patients had a decrease in dose or interruption of LIVMARLI in response to ALT increases. In the majority of cases, the elevations resolved or improved after discontinuation or dose modification of LIVMARLI. In some cases, the elevations resolved or improved without change in LIVMARLI dosing. Increases to more than three times baseline in ALT occurred in 26% of patients treated with LIVMARLI and increases to more than five times baseline occurred in 3%. AST increases to more than three times baseline occurred in 16% of patients treated with LIVMARLI, and an increase to more than five times baseline occurred in one patient. Elevations in transaminases were asymptomatic and not associated with bilirubin elevations or other laboratory abnormalities. Increases in Bilirubin Four (4.6%) patients in the pooled analysis experienced bilirubin increases above baseline, and LIVMARLI was subsequently withdrawn in two of these patients, who had elevated bilirubin at baseline. PFIC: In Trial 2, which enrolled 93 patients, 47 patients received doses of LIVMARLI up to 570 mcg/kg BID, with a median duration of exposure of 6 months (range: 0.3-6.7 months). The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) for PFIC patients treated with LIVMARLI at a rate greater than placebo are presented in Table 6 below. Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse reaction; the majority of episodes were mild and transient with a median duration of 5.5\u00a0days. Nineteen (40.4%) LIVMARLI-treated subjects had diarrhea greater than or equal to 7 days. Placebo-treated subjects had a median duration of 3 days of diarrhea and two subjects (4.3%) experienced diarrhea with a duration greater than or equal to 7 days. There were no severe events reported. The majority of abdominal pain events were mild based on AE grading, and associated with concurrent diarrhea. One LIVMARLI-treated patient with an event of mild diarrhea discontinued treatment. Treatment interruptions or dose reductions occurred in 3 (6.4%) LIVMARLI-treated patients due to diarrhea or abdominal pain. No placebo-treated subjects discontinued treatment or had dose reductions or interruptions due to diarrhea. Table 6: Adverse Reactions (any grade) Occurring in \u22655% and at a Rate Greater Than Placebo in Patients Treated with LIVMARLI in the PFIC Trial \u2020 Terms were defined as: Abdominal Pain includes : abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, abdominal distension Transaminases increased includes : Hypertransaminasaemia, ALT abnormal, ALT increased, AST abnormal, AST increased, Transaminases increased, Hepatic enzyme increased. Bone Fracture includes : upper limb fracture, lower limb fracture, radius fracture, ulna fracture, femur fracture, foot fracture Adverse Reaction (Any Grade) Placebo n=46 LIVMARLI n=47 Diarrhea 9 (19.6%) 27 (57.4%) Abdominal pain \u2020 7 (15.2%) 13 (27.7%) Transaminases increased (ALT or AST) \u2020 3 (6.5%) 8 (17%) Hematochezia or rectal hemorrhage 1 (2.2%) 4 (8.5%) Bone Fractures \u2020 0 3 (6.4%) Hepatotoxicity LIVMARLI treatment is associated with a potential for drug-induced liver injury. In PFIC patients in Trial 2, treatment-emergent elevations of liver tests or worsening of liver tests, relative to baseline values, and hepatic decompensation events were observed. Two patients experienced drug-induced liver injury (DILI) attributable to LIVMARLI; one patient received 570 mcg/kg twice daily and the second patient required dose interruption and reduction. Two additional patients experienced DILI in the open-label extension portion of the trial. Of these four patients, one patient required liver transplant and another patient died. Biliary Complications In the placebo-controlled portion of Trial 2, two LIVMARLI-treated patients developed cholangitis or cholecystitis within 3-weeks of drug discontinuation (after 84 days and 130 days after initiating LIVMARLI treatment, respectively). Four LIVMARLI-treated patients developed cholecystitis or cholangitis in the open-label extension portion of Trial 2; the average time to onset was 281 days. Bone Fracture In PFIC patients in Trial 2, treatment-emergent bone fracture events were observed. Three receiving  LIVMARLI experienced bone fractures relative to none in placebo-treated patients. The median time to onset of fractures was 73 days. Two LIVMARLI-treated patients developed bone fractures in the open-label portion of Trial 2, with average time to onset of fracture was 204 days. Bleeding In PFIC patients in Trial 2, treatment-emergent events of hematochezia (4 [8.5%] versus 1 [2.2%]), decrease in hemoglobin greater than or equal to 2 grams/dL from baseline (8 [17%] versus 1 [2.2%]), were reported more frequently in LIVMARLI-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of LIVMARLI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: hematemesis, liver transplant, post-endoscopy hemorrhage, post-liver biopsy hemorrhage General disorders and administration site conditions: drug ineffective Injury, poisoning and procedural complications : off label use Investigations : gamma-glutamyltransferase increased Nervous system disorders : intracranial hemorrhage",
