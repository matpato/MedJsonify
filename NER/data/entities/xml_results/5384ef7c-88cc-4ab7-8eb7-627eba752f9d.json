    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022\u00a0Chronic intravenous infusions delivered using an external infusion pump with an indwelling central venous catheter are associated with the risk of blood stream infections\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (BSIs) and sepsis, which may be fatal. (5.1) \u2022\u00a0Do not abruptly lower the dose or withdraw dosing. (5.2) \u2022\u00a0Treprostinil injection may cause symptomatic hypotension. (5.4) \u2022\u00a0Treprostinil injection inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding. (5.5) 5.1 Risk of Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection Chronic intravenous infusions of Treprostinil injection delivered using an external infusion pump with an indwelling central venous catheter are associated with the risk of blood stream infections (BSIs) and sepsis, which may be fatal. Therefore, continuous subcutaneous infusion is the preferred mode of administration. In an open-label study of IV treprostinil (n=47) using an external infusion pump, there were seven catheter-related line infections during approximately 35 patient years, or about 1 BSI event per 5 years of use. A CDC survey of seven sites that used IV treprostinil for the treatment of PAH found approximately 1 BSI (defined as any positive blood culture) event per 3 years of use. Administration of IV Treprostinil injection with a high pH glycine diluent has been associated with a lower incidence of BSIs when compared to neutral diluents (sterile water, 0.9% sodium chloride) when used along with catheter care guidelines. In an open-label study of an implantable pump (n=60), there were two blood stream infections (BSIs) related to the implant procedure during approximately 265 patient years. 5.2 Worsening PAH upon Abrupt Withdrawal or Sudden Large Dose Reduction Avoid abrupt withdrawal or sudden large reductions in dosage of Treprostinil injection, which may result in worsening of PAH symptoms. 5.3 Patients with Hepatic Insufficiency Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic insufficiency, because such patients will likely be exposed to greater systemic concentrations relative to patients with normal hepatic function [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.4 Risk of Symptomatic Hypotension Treprostinil is a pulmonary and systemic vasodilator. In patients with low systemic arterial pressure, treatment with Treprostinil injection may produce symptomatic hypotension. 5.5 Risk of Bleeding Treprostinil injection inhibits platelet aggregation and increases the risk of bleeding.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Infections associated with intravenous administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Most common adverse reactions (incidence >3%) reported in clinical studies with Treprostinil injection: subcutaneous infusion site pain and reaction, headache, diarrhea, nausea, jaw pain, vasodilatation, edema, and hypotension. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-866-210-9797 or contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Events with Subcutaneously Administered Treprostinil injection Patients receiving Treprostinil injection as a subcutaneous infusion reported a wide range of adverse events, many potentially related to the underlying disease (dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, right ventricular heart failure, and pallor). During clinical trials with subcutaneous infusion of Treprostinil injection, infusion site pain and reaction were the most common adverse events among those treated with Treprostinil injection. Infusion site reaction was defined as any local adverse event other than pain or bleeding/bruising at the infusion site and included symptoms such as erythema, induration, or rash. Infusion site reactions were sometimes severe and could lead to discontinuation of treatment. Table 3: Percentages of Subjects Reporting Subcutaneous Infusion Site Adverse Events Reaction Pain Placebo Treprostinil Injection Placebo Treprostinil Injection Severe 1 38 2 39 Requiring narcotics a NA b NA b 1 32 Leading to discontinuation 0 3 0 7 a based on prescriptions for narcotics, not actual use b medications used to treat infusion site pain were not distinguished from those used to treat site\u00a0reactions Other adverse events included diarrhea, jaw pain, edema, vasodilatation, and nausea, and these are generally considered to be related to the pharmacologic effects of Treprostinil injection, whether administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Adverse Reactions during Chronic Dosing Table 4 lists adverse reactions that occurred at\u00a0a rate of at least 3% more frequent in patients treated with subcutaneous Treprostinil injection than with placebo in controlled trials in PAH. Table 4: Adverse Reactions in Controlled 12-Week Studies of Subcutaneous Treprostinil Injection and at least 3% more frequent than on Placebo Adverse Reaction Treprostinil Injection (N=236) Percent of Patients Placebo (N=233) Percent of Patients Infusion Site Pain 85 27 Infusion Site Reaction 83 27 Headache 27 23 Diarrhea 25 16 Nausea 22 18 Rash 14 11 Jaw Pain 13 5 Vasodilatation 11 5 Edema 9 3 Reported adverse reactions (at least 3% more frequent on drug than on placebo) are included with the exception of those too general to be informative, and those not plausibly attributable to the use of the drug, because they were associated with the condition being treated or are very common in the treated population. While hypotension occurred in both groups, the event was experienced twice as frequently in the Treprostinil injection group as compared to the placebo group (4% in Treprostinil injection treatment group versus 2% in placebo-controlled group). As a potent vasodilator, hypotension is possible with the administration of Treprostinil injection. The safety of Treprostinil injection was also studied in a long-term, open-label extension study in which 860 patients were dosed for a mean duration of 1.6 years, with a maximum exposure of 4.6 years. Twenty-nine (29%) percent achieved a dose of at least 40 ng/kg/min (max: 290 ng/kg/min). The safety profile during this chronic dosing study was similar to that observed in the 12-week placebo-controlled study except for the following suspected adverse drug reactions (occurring in at least 3% of patients): anorexia, vomiting, infusion site infection, asthenia, and abdominal pain. Adverse Events Attributable to the Drug Delivery System In controlled studies of Treprostinil injection administered subcutaneously, there were no reports of infection related to the drug delivery system. There were 187 infusion system complications reported in 28% of patients (23% Treprostinil injection, 33% placebo); 173 (93%) were pump related and 14 (7%) related to the infusion set. Eight of these patients (4 Treprostinil injection, 4 placebo) reported non-serious adverse events resulting from infusion system complications. Adverse events resulting from problems with the delivery systems were typically related to either symptoms of excess Treprostinil injection (e.g., nausea) or return of PAH symptoms (e.g., dyspnea). These events were generally resolved by correcting the delivery system pump or infusion set problem, such as replacing the syringe or battery, reprogramming the pump, or straightening a crimped infusion line. Adverse events resulting from problems with the delivery system did not lead to clinical instability or rapid deterioration. In addition to these adverse events due to the drug delivery system during subcutaneous administration, the following adverse events may be attributable to the IV mode of infusion including arm swelling, paresthesia,\u00a0hematoma, and pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during post-approval use of Treprostinil injection. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The following events have been chosen for inclusion because of a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, and potential connection to Treprostinil injection. These events are thrombophlebitis associated with peripheral intravenous infusion, thrombocytopenia, bone pain, pruritus, dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia/muscle spasm, and pain in extremity. In addition, generalized rashes, sometimes macular or papular in nature, and cellulitis have been infrequently reported.",
