    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia. ( 5.5 , 6.1 ) 5.1   Cardiomyopathy Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death [see . Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Boxed Warning: Cardiomyopathy ] There is a 4 to 6 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products. The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline. Withhold Ontruzant for \u2265 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [see . The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied. Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [see . Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Cardiac Monitoring: Conduct thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan. The following schedule is recommended: Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of Ontruzant LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of Ontruzant Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if Ontruzant is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of Ontruzant as a component of adjuvant therapy. In NSABPB31, 15% (158/1031) of patients discontinued trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow-up duration of 8.7 years in the AC-TH (anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab) arm. In HERA (one-year trastuzumab treatment), the number of patients who discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up was 2.6% (44/1678). In BCIRG006, a total of 2.9% (31/1056) of patients in the TCH (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab) arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 1.4% during the monotherapy phase) and 5.7% (61/1068) of patients in the AC-TH arm (1.5% during the chemotherapy phase and 4.2% during the monotherapy phase) discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity. Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831) who developed congestive heart failure, one patient died of cardiomyopathy, one patient died suddenly without documented etiology, and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow-up. Approximately 24% of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF (defined as \u2265 50%) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow-up. Incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) is presented in Table 1. The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab products in patients with trastuzumab product-induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied.

In post-marketing reports, serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported. Severe reactions, which include bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypoxia, and severe hypotension, were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion. However, the onset and clinical course were variable, including progressive worsening, initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration, or delayed post-infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration. For fatal events, death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction. Interrupt Ontruzant infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea, clinically significant hypotension, and intervention of medical therapy administered (which may include epinephrine, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, bronchodilators, and oxygen). Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions. There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction. Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion, the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre-medicated with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids. While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions, others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre-medications. 5.3   Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Ontruzant. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Ontruzant during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of Ontruzant [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 5.4   Pulmonary Toxicity Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and pulmonary fibrosis. Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [see . Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe toxicity. Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] 5.5   Exacerbation of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia In randomized, controlled clinical trials, the per-patient incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ].",

The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever, nausea, vomiting, infusion reactions, diarrhea, infections, increased cough, headache, fatigue, dyspnea, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and myalgia. Adverse reactions requiring interruption or discontinuation of trastuzumab product treatment include CHF, significant decline in left ventricular cardiac function, severe infusion reactions, and pulmonary toxicity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] In the metastatic gastric cancer setting, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that were increased (\u2265 5% difference) in the trastuzumab arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, anemia, stomatitis, weight loss, upper respiratory tract infections, fever, thrombocytopenia, mucosal inflammation, nasopharyngitis, and dysgeusia. The most common adverse reactions which resulted in discontinuation of treatment on the trastuzumab-containing arm in the absence of disease progression were infection, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. Adjuvant Breast Cancer The information below reflects exposure to one-year trastuzumab therapy across three randomized, open-label studies, NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA, with (n = 3678) or without (n = 3363) trastuzumab in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. HERA Table 3 reflects exposure to trastuzumab in 1678 patients in HERA; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks and median number of infusions was 18 [see . Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Table 3 Adverse Reactions (\u22651%) in HERA (All Grades) The incidence of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions was <1% in both arms for each listed term.

Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer with Trastuzumab Beyond One Year Extending adjuvant treatment beyond one year is not recommended [see . In HERA, a comparison of trastuzumab administered once every 3 weeks for two years versus one year was performed. The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year trastuzumab compared to the 1-year trastuzumab treatment arm (8.1% versus 4.6%, respectively). More patients experienced at least one adverse reaction of Grade 3 or higher in the 2-year trastuzumab treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm (16.3%). Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 The safety data from NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831 were obtained from 3655 patients, of whom 2000 received trastuzumab; the median treatment duration was 51 weeks [see . Clinical Studies (14.1) ] In NSABPB31, only Grade 3 to 5 adverse events, treatment-related Grade 2 events, and Grade 2\u22125 dyspnea were collected during and for up to 3 months following protocol-specified treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: fatigue (29.5% vs. 22.4%), infection (24.0% vs. 12.8%), hot flashes (17.1% vs. 15.0%), anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7%), dyspnea (11.8% vs. 4.6%), rash/desquamation (10.9% vs. 7.6%), leukopenia (10.5% vs. 8.4%), neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3%), headache (6.2% vs. 3.8%), pain (5.5% vs. 3.0%), edema (4.7% vs. 2.7%), and insomnia (4.3% vs. 1.5%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. In NCCTG N9831, data collection was limited to the following investigator-attributed treatment-related adverse reactions: NCI-CTC Grade 4 and 5 hematologic toxicities, Grade 3 to 5 non-hematologic toxicities, selected Grade 2 to 5 toxicities associated with taxanes (myalgia, arthralgias, nail changes, motor neuropathy, and sensory neuropathy) and Grade 1 to 5 cardiac toxicities occurring during chemotherapy and/or trastuzumab treatment. The following non-cardiac adverse reactions of Grade 2 to 5 occurred at an incidence of at least 2% greater among patients receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone: arthralgia (12.2% vs. 9.1%), nail changes (11.5% vs. 6.8%), dyspnea (2.4% vs. 0.2%), and diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0%). The majority of these events were Grade 2 in severity. BCIRG006 Safety data from BCIRG006 reflect exposure to trastuzumab as part of an adjuvant treatment regimen from 2124 patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment [AC-TH: n = 1068; TCH: n = 1056]. The overall median treatment duration was 54 weeks in both the AC-TH and TCH arms. The median number of infusions was 26 in the AC-TH arm and 30 in the TCH arm, including weekly infusions during the chemotherapy phase and every three week dosing in the monotherapy period [see . In BCIRG006, the toxicity profile was similar to that reported in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA with the exception of a lower incidence of CHF in the TCH arm. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Metastatic Breast Cancer Studies The safety of trastuzumab was evaluated in one randomized, open-label study (H0648g) of chemotherapy with (n = 235) or without (n = 234) intravenous trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancerand in one single-arm study (H0649g); in patients with metastatic breast cancer (n=222) [see . Patients received 4 mg/kg initial dose of trastuzumab followed by 2 mg/kg weekly. In H0648g, 58% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 9% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively. In H0649g, 31% of patients received trastuzumab for \u2265 6 months and 16% received trastuzumab for \u2265 12 months, respectively.

Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (FC+H) (n=294) or chemotherapy alone (FC) (n=290) Patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg administered on Day 1 (prior to chemotherapy) followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days until disease progression. Cisplatin was administered at 80 mg/m Clinical Studies (14.3) ] 2 on Day 1 and the fluoropyrimidine was administered as either capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 orally twice a day on Days 1 to 14 or 5-fluorouracil 800 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion Days 1 through 5. Chemotherapy was administered for six 21-day cycles. Median duration of trastuzumab treatment was 21 weeks and the median number of trastuzumab infusions administered was eight.

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function (LVEF) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. In HERA, the median duration of follow-up was 12.6 months (12.4 months in the observation arm; 12.6 months in the 1-year trastuzumab arm); and in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, 7.9 years in the AC-T arm, 8.3 years in the AC-TH arm. Following initiation of trastuzumab therapy, the incidence of new-onset dose-limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving trastuzumab and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in NSABP B31 and NCCTG N9831, and in patients receiving one-year trastuzumab monotherapy compared to observation in HERA (see Table 6 , Figures 1 and 2 ). The incidence of new-onset cardiac dysfunction, as measured by LVEF, remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow-up of 2.0 years in the AC-TH arm. This analysis showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, with 64.5% of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC-TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow-up, and 90.3% having full or partial LVEF recovery. Table 6 Myocardial Dysfunction (by LVEF) in NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, HERA, and BCIRG006 For NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, and HERA, events are counted from the beginning of trastuzumab treatment.

BCIRG006: Cumulative Incidence of Time to First LVEF Decline of \u2265 10 Percentage Points from Baseline and to Below 50% with Death as a Competing Risk Event The incidence of congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system (I\u2212IV, where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure) (see Table 2 ). In the metastatic breast cancer trials, the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with anthracyclines. In ToGA, 5.0% of patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1.1% of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50% with a \u2265 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with trastuzumab, the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever, occurring in approximately 40% of patients in clinical trials. Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and meperidine (with or without reduction in the rate of trastuzumab infusion); permanent discontinuation of trastuzumab for infusion reactions was required in < 1% of patients. Other signs and/or symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, pain (in some cases at tumor sites), rigors, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated blood pressure, rash, and asthenia. Infusion reactions occurred in 21% and 35% of patients, and were severe in 1.4% and 9% of patients, on second or subsequent trastuzumab infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, respectively. In the post-marketing setting, severe infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and angioedema have been reported. Anemia In randomized controlled clinical trials, the overall incidence of anemia (30% vs. 21% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 anemia (12.3% vs. 6.7% [NSABPB31]), and of anemia requiring transfusions (0.1% vs. 0 patients [NCCTG N9831]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. Following the administration of trastuzumab as a single agent (H0649g), the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 anemia was < 1%. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer), on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the overall incidence of anemia was 28% compared to 21% and of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 anemia was 12.2% compared to 10.3%. Neutropenia In randomized controlled clinical trials in the adjuvant setting, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 4 to 5 neutropenia (1.7% vs. 0.8% [NCCTG N9831]) and of selected Grade 2 to 5 neutropenia (6.4% vs. 4.3% [NSABPB31]) were increased in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. In a randomized, controlled trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia (32% vs. 22%) and of febrile neutropenia (23% vs. 17%) were also increased in patients randomized to trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 36.8% compared to 28.9%; febrile neutropenia 5.1% compared to 2.8%. Infection The overall incidences of infection (46% vs. 30% [H0648g]), of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (24.3% vs. 13.4% [NSABPB31]) and of selected Grade 3 to 5 infection/febrile neutropenia (2.9% vs. 1.4%) [NCCTG N9831]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. The most common site of infections in the adjuvant setting involved the upper respiratory tract, skin, and urinary tract. In BCIRG006, the overall incidence of infection was higher with the addition of trastuzumab to AC-T but not to TCH [44% (AC-TH), 37% (TCH), 38% (AC-T)]. The incidences of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 4 infection were similar [25% (AC-TH), 21% (TCH), 23% (AC-T)] across the three arms. In a randomized, controlled trial in treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the reported incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher (23% vs. 17%) in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone. Pulmonary Toxicity Adjuvant Breast Cancer Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of selected NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 pulmonary toxicity (14.3% vs. 5.4% [NSABPB31]) and of selected NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 pulmonary toxicity and spontaneous reported Grade 2 dyspnea (3.4% vs. 0.9% [NCCTG N9831]) was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. The most common pulmonary toxicity was dyspnea (NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 11.8% vs. 4.6% [NSABPB31]; NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5: 2.4% vs. 0.2% [NCCTG N9831]). Pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving trastuzumab compared with 0.3% of those receiving chemotherapy alone. Fatal respiratory failure occurred in 3 patients receiving trastuzumab, one as a component of multi-organ system failure, as compared to 1 patient receiving chemotherapy alone. In HERA, there were 4 cases of interstitial pneumonitis in the one-year trastuzumab treatment arm compared to none in the observation arm at a median follow-up duration of 12.6 months. Metastatic Breast Cancer Among women receiving trastuzumab for treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was also increased. Pulmonary adverse events have been reported in the post-marketing experience as part of the symptom complex of infusion reactions. Pulmonary events include bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. For a detailed description, see . Warnings and Precautions (5.4) Thrombosis/Embolism In 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of thrombotic adverse events was higher in patients receiving trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone in three studies (2.6% vs. 1.5% [NSABPB31], 2.5% and 3.7% vs. 2.2% [BCIRG006] and 2.1% vs. 0% [H0648g]). Diarrhea Among women receiving adjuvant therapy for breast cancer, the incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 2 to 5 diarrhea (6.7% vs. 5.4% [NSABPB31]) and of NCI-CTC Grade 3 to 5 diarrhea (2.2% vs. 0% [NCCTG N9831]), and of Grade 1 to 4 diarrhea (7% vs. 1% [HERA; one-year trastuzumab treatment at 12.6 months median duration of follow-up]) were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab as compared to controls. In BCIRG006, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was higher [5.7% AC-TH, 5.5% TCH vs. 3.0% AC-T] and of Grade 1 to 4 was higher [51% AC-TH, 63% TCH vs. 43% AC-T] among women receiving trastuzumab. Of patients receiving trastuzumab as a single agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 25% experienced diarrhea. An increased incidence of diarrhea was observed in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Renal Toxicity In ToGA (metastatic gastric cancer) on the trastuzumab-containing arm as compared to the chemotherapy alone arm the incidence of renal impairment was 18% compared to 14.5%. Severe (Grade 3/4) renal failure was 2.7% on the trastuzumab-containing arm compared to 1.7% on the chemotherapy only arm. Treatment discontinuation for renal insufficiency/failure was 2% on the trastuzumab-containing arm and 0.3% on the chemotherapy only arm. In the post-marketing setting, rare cases of nephrotic syndrome with pathologic evidence of glomerulopathy have been reported. The time to onset ranged from 4 months to approximately 18 months from initiation of trastuzumab therapy. Pathologic findings included membranous glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, and fibrillary glomerulonephritis. Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure. 6.2   Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of trastuzumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infusion reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence, including pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Glomerulopathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Immune thrombocytopenia Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS): Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab products. Patients with significant tumor burden (e.g. bulky metastases) may be at a higher risk. Patients could present with hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS. Providers should consider additional monitoring and/or treatment as clinically indicated.",
