    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS MESNEX is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to mesna or to any of the excipients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. \u2022 Known hypersensitivity to mesna or to any of the excipients, including benzyl alcohol. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Less severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Dermatologic toxicity: Skin rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. Skin rash, urticaria, and angioedema have also been seen. Monitor patients. If a reaction occurs, discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Benzyl alcohol toxicity: Serious and fatal adverse reactions can occur in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including MESNEX injection. Avoid use in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Laboratory test alterations: False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions MESNEX may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. These reactions may include fever, cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia), acute renal impairment, hypoxia, respiratory distress, urticaria, angioedema, laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematological abnormalities, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and myalgia. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Monitor for signs or symptoms. Discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care. 5.2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions, consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred. MESNEX may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria, rash, erythema, pruritus, burning sensation, angioedema, periorbital edema, flushing and stomatitis. These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure. Discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care. 5.3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d occurred in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg/kg/day (blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0.61 to 1.378 mmol/L). Symptoms associated with \u201cgasping syndrome\u201d and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematological abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Premature neonates and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol. The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known. MESNEX injection contains 10.4 mg/mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol. Avoid use of MESNEX injection in premature neonates and low-birth weight infants. MESNEX tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. 5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with MESNEX when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests).  The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies). False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity MESNEX may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactiviation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level. False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid MESNEX may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman\u2019s reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid. 5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds MESNEX is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to MESNEX.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling. \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Dermatological Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Laboratory Test Interferences [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reactions (> 10%) when MESNEX is given with ifosfamide are nausea, vomiting, constipation, leukopenia, fatigue, fever, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, granulocytopenia, diarrhea, asthenia, abdominal pain, headache, alopecia, and somnolence. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare at 1-866-888-2472, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MESNEX adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600-1200 mg MESNEX injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers and single oral doses of 600-2400 mg of MESNEX tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers. The most frequently reported side effects (observed in two or more healthy volunteers) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of MESNEX injection alone were headache, injection site reactions, flushing, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, diarrhea, anorexia, fever, pharyngitis, hyperesthesia, influenza-like symptoms, and coughing. In two Phase 1 multiple-dose studies where healthy volunteers received MESNEX tablets alone or intravenous MESNEX followed by repeated doses of MESNEX tablets, flatulence and rhinitis were reported. In addition, constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous MESNEX. Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving MESNEX alone included injection site reactions, abdominal pain/colic, epigastric pain/burning, mucosal irritation, lightheadedness, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, nasal congestion, rigors, paresthesia, photophobia, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, extremity pain, malaise, chest pain, dysuria, pleuritic pain, dry mouth, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis. In healthy volunteers, MESNEX was commonly associated with a rapid (within 24 hours) decrease in lymphocyte count, which was generally reversible within one week of administration. Because MESNEX is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimens, it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to MESNEX from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents. Adverse reactions reasonably associated with MESNEX administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide-containing regimens are presented in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions in \u2265 5% of Patients Receiving MESNEX in combination with Ifosfamide-containing Regimens MESNEX Regimen Intravenous-Intravenous-Intravenous Intravenous dosing of ifosfamide and MESNEX followed by either intravenous or oral doses of MESNEX according to the applicable dosage schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2) ].

Because these reactions are reported from a population of unknown size, precise estimates of frequency cannot be made.
