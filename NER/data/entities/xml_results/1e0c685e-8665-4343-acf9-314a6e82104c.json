    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5\tWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Bleeding: Increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid intramuscular injections. Monitor for bleeding. ( 5.1 ) Hypersensitivity: Monitor patients treated with TNKase during and for several hours after administration. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, initiate appropriate therapy (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine). ( 5.2 ) Thromboembolism: The use of thrombolytics can increase the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with high likelihood of left heart thrombus. ( 5.3 ) Cholesterol Embolization: Has been reported in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. ( 5.4 ) Arrhythmias: It is recommended that anti-arrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular irritability be available when TNKase is administered. ( 5.5 ) Increased Risk of Heart Failure and Recurrent Ischemia when used with Planned Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in STEMI: In patients with a large ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, choose either thrombolysis or PCI as the primary treatment for reperfusion. Rescue PCI or subsequent elective PCI may be performed after administration of thrombolytic therapies if medically appropriate. ( 5.6 ) 5.1\tBleeding TNKase can cause significant, sometimes fatal, internal or external bleeding, especially at arterial and venous puncture sites. Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. Avoid intramuscular injections and trauma to the patient while on TNKase. Perform arterial and venous punctures carefully and only as required. To minimize bleeding from noncompressible sites, avoid internal jugular and subclavian venous punctures. If an arterial puncture is necessary during TNKase administration, use an upper extremity vessel that is accessible to manual compression, apply pressure for at least 30 minutes, and monitor the puncture site closely. Should serious bleeding that is not controlled by local pressure occur, discontinue any concomitant heparin or antiplatelet agents immediately and treat appropriately. Because of the higher risk of intracranial hemorrhage in patients treated for acute ischemic stroke, limit treatment to facilities that can provide timely access to appropriate evaluation and management of intracranial hemorrhage. Aspirin and heparin have been administered concomitantly with and following administration of TNKase in the management of acute myocardial infarction, but the concomitant administration of heparin and aspirin with and following administration of TNKase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke during the first 24 hours after symptom onset has not been investigated. Because heparin, aspirin, or TNKase may cause bleeding complications, carefully monitor for bleeding, especially at arterial puncture sites. Hemorrhage can occur 1 or more days after administration of TNKase, while patients are still receiving anticoagulant therapy. If serious bleeding occurs, treat appropriately. In the following conditions, the risks of bleeding with TNKase therapy for all approved indications are increased and should be weighed against the anticipated benefits: Recent major surgery or procedure (e.g., coronary artery bypass graft, obstetrical delivery, organ biopsy, previous puncture of noncompressible vessels) Cerebrovascular disease Recent intracranial hemorrhage (if not contraindicated) Recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding Recent trauma Hypertension: systolic BP above 175 mm Hg or diastolic BP above 110 mm Hg Acute pericarditis Subacute bacterial endocarditis Hemostatic defects including those secondary to severe hepatic or renal disease Significant hepatic dysfunction Pregnancy Diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy, or other hemorrhagic ophthalmic conditions Septic thrombophlebitis or occluded AV cannula at seriously infected site Advanced age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] Patients currently receiving anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin sodium) Any other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be particularly difficult to manage because of its location. 5.2\tHypersensitivity Hypersensitivity, including urticarial / anaphylactic reactions, have been reported after administration of TNKase (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, laryngeal edema, rash, and urticaria). Monitor patients treated with TNKase during and for several hours after administration. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, initiate appropriate therapy (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine). 5.3\tThromboembolism The use of thrombolytics can increase the risk of thrombo-embolic events in patients with high likelihood of left heart thrombus, such as patients with mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation. 5.4\tCholesterol Embolization Cholesterol embolism has been reported in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. Investigate cause of any new embolic event and treat appropriately. 5.5\tArrhythmias Coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. These arrhythmias (such as sinus bradycardia, accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature depolarizations, ventricular tachycardia) may be managed with standard anti-arrhythmic measures. It is recommended that anti-arrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular irritability be available when TNKase is administered. 5.6\tIncreased Risk of Heart Failure and Recurrent Ischemia when used with Planned Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in STEMI In a trial of patients with STEMI, there were worse outcomes in the individual components of the primary endpoint between TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone (mortality 6.7% vs. 4.9%, respectively; cardiogenic shock 6.3% vs. 4.8%, respectively; and CHF 12% vs. 9.2%, respectively). In addition, there were worse outcomes in recurrent MI (6.1% vs. 3.7%, respectively; p = 0.03) and repeat target vessel revascularization (6.6% vs. 3.4%, respectively; p = 0.0045) in patients receiving TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone [see . In patients with large ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, physicians should choose either thrombolysis or PCI as the primary treatment strategy for reperfusion. Rescue PCI or subsequent elective PCI may be performed after administration of thrombolytic therapies if medically appropriate; however, the optimal use of adjunctive antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in this setting is unknown.
