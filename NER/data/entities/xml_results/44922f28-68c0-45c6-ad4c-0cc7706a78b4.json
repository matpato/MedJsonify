    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiorespiratory Adverse Reactions: Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. ( 5.3 ) Paradoxical Behavior: Agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. ( 5.4 ) Dependence and Withdrawal with Long-Term Use: Use for several days to weeks may lead to physical dependence to midazolam. Do not abruptly discontinue midazolam. Gradually taper the dosage using a tapering schedule that is individualized to the patient. ( 5.5 ) Debilitation and Comorbid Considerations : Higher risk adult and pediatric surgical patients, elderly patients and debilitated adult and pediatric patients require lower dosages, whether or not concomitant sedating medications have been administered. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Intra-Arterial Injection: There have been limited reports of intra-arterial injection of midazolam. Adverse events have included local reactions, as well as isolated reports of seizure activity in which no clear causal relationship was established. ( 5.7 ) Impaired Cognitive Function : Because of partial or complete impairment of recall, patients should not operate hazardous machinery or a motor vehicle until drug effects have subsided. ( 5.8 ) Hypotension and Seizure in Preterm Infants and Neonates: Avoid rapid injection in the neonatal population. ( 5.9 ) Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome: Receiving Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy can result in neonatal sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal. ( 5.10 , 8.1 ) Pediatric Neurotoxicity : In developing animals, exposures greater than 3 hours cause neurotoxicity. Weigh benefits against potential risks when considering elective procedures in children under 3 years old. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and Resuscitation Prior to the intravenous administration of midazolam in any dose, ensure the immediate availability of oxygen, resuscitative drugs, age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag/valve/mask ventilation and intubation, and skilled personnel for the maintenance of a patent airway and support of ventilation. Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation, and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, should administer Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and apnea, including the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation, and cardiovascular resuscitation. Continuously monitor patients for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea, with means readily available (e.g., pulse oximetry). Hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea can lead to hypoxia and/or cardiac arrest unless effective countermeasures are taken immediately. A benzodiazepine reversal agent (i.e., flumazenil) should be immediately available during administration of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Continuously monitor vital signs during the recovery period. Because intravenous midazolam can depress respiration [see Clinical Pharmacology ( , especially when used concomitantly with opioid agonists and other sedatives 12 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( , it should be used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia only in the presence of personnel skilled in early detection of hypoventilation, maintaining a patent airway, and supporting ventilation. 2 )] 5.2 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids, Other Sedative Hypnotics, or Other Central Nervous System Depressants Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] Titrate the dose of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response. Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension, airway obstruction, hypoventilation, apnea, and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, the elderly, and ASA\u2011PS III or IV patients. Concomitant use of barbiturates, alcohol, or other central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, desaturation, or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect. Narcotic premedication also depresses the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation. 5.3 Risk of Cardiorespiratory Adverse Reactions Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. These have included respiratory depression, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation, apnea, respiratory arrest and/or cardiac arrest, sometimes resulting in death or permanent neurologic injury. There have also been rare reports of hypotensive episodes requiring treatment during or after diagnostic or surgical manipulations particularly in adult or pediatric patients with hemodynamic instability. Hypotension occurred more frequently in the sedation studies in patients premedicated with an opioid. Excessive single doses or rapid intravenous administration may result in respiratory depression, airway obstruction and/or arrest. When used for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia, midazolam should always be titrated slowly in adult or pediatric patients. Adverse hemodynamic events have been reported in pediatric patients with cardiovascular instability; rapid intravenous administration should also be avoided in this population. Continuously monitor patients for early signs of hypoventilation, airway obstruction, and apnea using capnography, pulse oximetry, and clinical assessment [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.4 Risk of Paradoxical Behavior Reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic movements and muscle tremor), hyperactivity and combativeness have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients. These reactions may be due to inadequate or excessive dosing or improper administration of midazolam; however, consideration should be given to the possibility of cerebral hypoxia or true paradoxical reactions. Should such reactions occur, the response to each dose of midazolam and all other drugs, including local anesthetics, should be evaluated before proceeding. Reversal of such responses with flumazenil has been reported in pediatric patients. 5.5 Risk of Dependence and Withdrawal with Long-Term Use of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection The continued use of benzodiazepines for several days to weeks may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. If used for long-term use (i.e., for several days to weeks), abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of midazolam, or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use. After extended therapy, do not abruptly discontinue Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. When discontinuing midazolam in a physically-dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage using a tapering schedule that is individualized to the patient [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 ), Dependence ( 9.3 )] 5.6 Debilitation and Comorbid Considerations Higher risk adult and pediatric surgical patients, elderly patients and debilitated adult and pediatric patients require lower dosages, whether or not concomitant sedating medications have been administered. Adult or pediatric patients with COPD are unusually sensitive to the respiratory depressant effect of midazolam. Pediatric and adult patients undergoing procedures involving the upper airway such as upper endoscopy or dental care, are particularly vulnerable to episodes of desaturation and hypoventilation due to partial airway obstruction. Adult and pediatric patients with chronic renal failure and patients with congestive heart failure eliminate midazolam more slowly [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Because elderly patients frequently have inefficient function of one or more organ systems and because dosage requirements have been shown to decrease with age, reduced initial dosage of midazolam is recommended, and the possibility of profound and/or prolonged effect should be considered. 12.3 )] Do not administer Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to adult or pediatric patients in shock or coma, or in acute alcohol intoxication with depression of vital signs. Particular care should be exercised in the use of intravenous midazolam in adult or pediatric patients with uncompensated acute illnesses, such as severe fluid or electrolyte disturbances. 5.7 Risk of Intra-Arterial Injection There have been limited reports of intra-arterial injection of midazolam. Adverse events have included local reactions, as well as isolated reports of seizure activity in which no clear causal relationship was established. Precautions against unintended intra-arterial injection should be taken. Extravasation should also be avoided. The safety and efficacy of Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection following nonintravenous routes of administration have not been established. Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection should only be administered intravenously. 5.8 Impaired Cognitive Function Midazolam is associated with a high incidence of partial or complete impairment of recall for the next several hours. The decision as to when patients who have received injectable midazolam, particularly on an outpatient basis, may again engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness, operate hazardous machinery or drive a motor vehicle must be individualized. Gross tests of recovery from the effects of midazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology ( cannot be relied upon to predict reaction time under stress. It is recommended that no patient operate hazardous machinery or a motor vehicle until the effects of the drug, such as drowsiness, have subsided or until one full day after anesthesia and surgery, whichever is longer. For pediatric patients, particular care should be taken to assure safe ambulation. 12.3 )] 5.9 Risk of Hypotension and Seizure in Preterm Infants and Neonates Rapid injection should be avoided in the neonatal population. Midazolam administered rapidly as an intravenous injection (i.e., less than 2 minutes) has been associated with severe hypotension in neonates, particularly when the patient has also received fentanyl. Likewise, severe hypotension has been observed in neonates receiving a continuous infusion of midazolam who then receive a rapid intravenous injection of fentanyl. Seizures have been reported in several neonates following rapid intravenous administration. The neonate also has reduced and/or immature organ function and is also vulnerable to profound and/or prolonged respiratory effects of midazolam. 5.10 Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome Receiving Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate. Monitor neonates exposed to Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and manage these neonates accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.11 Pediatric Neurotoxicity Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear. However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans [see Nonclinical Pharmacology ( . 13.2 )] Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects. These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness. Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks. 5.12 Risk of Increased Intraocular Pressure in Patients with Glaucoma Benzodiazepines, including Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, can increase intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. Measurements of intraocular pressure in patients without eye disease show a moderate lowering following induction with midazolam. Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection may be used in patients with open-angle glaucoma only if they are receiving appropriate therapy. Patients with open-angle glaucoma may need to have their ophthalmologic status evaluated following treatment with Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Midazolam in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.",
