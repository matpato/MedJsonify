    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE XARELTO is a factor Xa inhibitor indicated: to reduce risk of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation ( 1.1 ) for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) ( 1.2 ) for treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) ( 1.3 ) for reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT or PE ( 1.4 ) for the prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery ( 1.5 ) for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in acutely ill medical patients ( 1.6 ) to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) ( 1.7 ) to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD), including patients after recent lower extremity revascularization due to symptomatic PAD ( 1.8 ) for treatment of VTE and reduction in the risk of recurrent VTE in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years ( 1.9 ) for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients 2 years and older with congenital heart disease after the Fontan procedure ( 1.10 ) 1.1\tReduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation XARELTO is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. There are limited data on the relative effectiveness of XARELTO and warfarin in reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism when warfarin therapy is well-controlled [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2\tTreatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis XARELTO is indicated for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 1.3\tTreatment of Pulmonary Embolism XARELTO is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE). 1.4\tReduction in the Risk of Recurrence of Deep Vein Thrombosis and/or Pulmonary Embolism XARELTO is indicated for the reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and/or PE in adult patients at continued risk for recurrent DVT and/or PE after completion of initial treatment lasting at least 6 months. 1.5\tProphylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery XARELTO is indicated for the prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE in adult patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery. 1.6\tProphylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications Not at High Risk of Bleeding XARELTO is indicated for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and VTE related death during hospitalization and post hospital discharge in adult patients admitted for an acute medical illness who are at risk for thromboembolic complications due to moderate or severe restricted mobility and other risk factors for VTE and not at high risk of bleeding [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5) ] 1.7\tReduction of Risk of Major Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) XARELTO, in combination with aspirin, is indicated to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) in adult patients with coronary artery disease. 1.8\tReduction of Risk of Major Thrombotic Vascular Events in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), Including Patients after Lower Extremity Revascularization due to Symptomatic PAD XARELTO, in combination with aspirin, is indicated to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, and major amputation of a vascular etiology) in adult patients with PAD, including patients who have recently undergone a lower extremity revascularization procedure due to symptomatic PAD. 1.9\tTreatment of Venous Thromboembolism and Reduction in Risk of Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism in Pediatric Patients XARELTO is indicated for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the reduction in the risk of recurrent VTE in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years after at least 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulant treatment. 1.10\tThromboprophylaxis in Pediatric Patients with Congenital Heart Disease after the Fontan Procedure XARELTO is indicated for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with congenital heart disease who have undergone the Fontan procedure.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS XARELTO is contraindicated in patients with: active pathological bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] severe hypersensitivity reaction to XARELTO (e.g., anaphylactic reactions) [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Active pathological bleeding ( 4 ) Severe hypersensitivity reaction to XARELTO ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of bleeding: XARELTO can cause serious and fatal bleeding. An agent to reverse the activity of rivaroxaban is available. ( 5.2 ) Pregnancy-related hemorrhage: Use XARELTO with caution in pregnant women due to the potential for obstetric hemorrhage and/or emergent delivery. ( 5.7 , 8.1 ) Prosthetic heart valves: XARELTO use not recommended. ( 5.8 ) Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome: XARELTO use not recommended. ( 5.10 ) 5.1\tIncreased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including XARELTO, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from XARELTO to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If XARELTO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1) ] 5.2\tRisk of Bleeding XARELTO increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. In deciding whether to prescribe XARELTO to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue XARELTO in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years. Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y 12 platelet inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Drug Interactions (7.4) ] Concomitant use of drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase bleeding risk [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] Risk of Hemorrhage in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at High Risk of Bleeding Acutely ill medical patients with the following conditions are at increased risk of bleeding with the use of XARELTO for primary VTE prophylaxis: history of bronchiectasis, pulmonary cavitation, or pulmonary hemorrhage, active cancer (i.e., undergoing acute, in-hospital cancer treatment), active gastroduodenal ulcer in the three months prior to treatment, history of bleeding in the three months prior to treatment, or dual antiplatelet therapy. XARELTO is not for use for primary VTE prophylaxis in these hospitalized, acutely ill medical patients at high risk of bleeding. Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available. Because of high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see . Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. Use of procoagulant reversal agents, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa, may be considered but has not been evaluated in clinical efficacy and safety studies. Monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using a clotting test (PT, INR or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not recommended. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.3\tSpinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture When neuraxial anesthesia (spinal/epidural anesthesia) or spinal puncture is employed, patients treated with anticoagulant agents for prevention of thromboembolic complications are at risk of developing an epidural or spinal hematoma which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis [see . Boxed Warning ] To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of XARELTO and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of XARELTO [see . Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of XARELTO is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] An indwelling epidural or intrathecal catheter should not be removed before at least 2 half-lives have elapsed (i.e., 18 hours in young patients aged 20 to 45 years and 26 hours in elderly patients aged 60 to 76 years), after the last administration of XARELTO [see . The next XARELTO dose should not be administered earlier than 6 hours after the removal of the catheter. If traumatic puncture occurs, delay the administration of XARELTO for 24 hours. Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, monitor frequently to detect any signs or symptoms of neurological impairment, such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. Instruct patients to immediately report if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms. If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae. 5.4\tUse in Patients with Renal Impairment Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Periodically assess renal function as clinically indicated (i.e., more frequently in situations in which renal function may decline) and adjust therapy accordingly [see . Consider dose adjustment or discontinuation of XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on XARELTO Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and of PE In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. There are limited clinical data in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min; therefore, observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in these patients. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min (including patients on dialysis); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. Discontinue XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. There are limited clinical data in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min; therefore, observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in these patients. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min (including patients on dialysis); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. Discontinue XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications Not at High Risk of Bleeding In patients with CrCl <30 mL/min, rivaroxaban exposure and pharmacodynamic effects are increased compared to patients with normal renal function. There are limited clinical data in patients with CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min; therefore, observe closely and promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss in these patients. There are no clinical data in patients with CrCl <15 mL/min (including patients on dialysis); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. Discontinue XARELTO in patients who develop acute renal failure while on treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Pediatric Patients There are limited clinical data in pediatric patients 1 year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ); therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients. There are no clinical data in pediatric patients younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above 97.5 th percentile; therefore, avoid the use of XARELTO in these patients [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] 5.5\tUse in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical data are available for adult patients with severe hepatic impairment. Avoid use of XARELTO in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment or with any hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy since drug exposure and bleeding risk may be increased [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] No clinical data are available in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. 5.6\tUse with P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] Avoid concomitant use of XARELTO with drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers [see . Drug Interactions (7.3) ] 5.7\tRisk of Pregnancy-Related Hemorrhage In pregnant women, XARELTO should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. XARELTO dosing in pregnancy has not been studied. The anticoagulant effect of XARELTO cannot be monitored with standard laboratory testing. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms suggesting blood loss (e.g., a drop in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit, hypotension, or fetal distress) [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 5.8\tPatients with Prosthetic Heart Valves On the basis of the GALILEO study, use of XARELTO is not recommended in patients who have had transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) because patients randomized to XARELTO experienced higher rates of death and bleeding compared to those randomized to an anti-platelet regimen. The safety and efficacy of XARELTO have not been studied in patients with other prosthetic heart valves or other valve procedures. Use of XARELTO is not recommended in patients with prosthetic heart valves. 5.9\tAcute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients Who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy Initiation of XARELTO is not recommended acutely as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy. 5.10\tIncreased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including XARELTO, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.",

During clinical development for the approved indications, 34,947 adult patients were exposed to XARELTO. Hemorrhage The most common adverse reactions with XARELTO were bleeding complications [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation In the ROCKET AF trial, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were bleeding events, with incidence rates of 4.3% for XARELTO vs. 3.1% for warfarin. The incidence of discontinuations for non-bleeding adverse events was similar in both treatment groups. Table 5 shows the number of patients experiencing various types of bleeding events in the ROCKET AF trial.

Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at Risk for Thromboembolic Complications Not at High Risk of Bleeding In the MAGELLAN study, the most frequent adverse reactions associated with permanent drug discontinuation were bleeding events. Cases of pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary hemorrhage with bronchiectasis were observed. Patients with bronchiectasis/pulmonary cavitation, active cancer (i.e., undergoing acute, in-hospital cancer treatment), dual antiplatelet therapy or active gastroduodenal ulcer or any bleeding in the previous three months all had an excess of bleeding with XARELTO compared with enoxaparin/placebo and are excluded from all MAGELLAN data presented in Table 9. The incidence of bleeding leading to drug discontinuation was 2.5% for XARELTO vs. 1.4% for enoxaparin/placebo. Table 9 shows the number of patients experiencing various types of bleeding events in the MAGELLAN study. Table 9:\tBleeding Events in MAGELLAN Patients at high risk of bleeding (i.e. bronchiectasis/pulmonary cavitation, active cancer, dual antiplatelet therapy or active gastroduodenal ulcer or any bleeding in the previous three months) were excluded.
