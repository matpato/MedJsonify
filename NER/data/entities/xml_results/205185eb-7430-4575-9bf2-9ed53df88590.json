    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions ( 5.1 ) Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, and solid organ transplant rejection. Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity and type of reaction. Infusion-related reactions: Interrupt, slow the rate of infusion, or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA based on the severity of reaction. ( 5.2 ) Complications of allogeneic HSCT: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. ( 5.3 ) Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective method of contraception. ( 5.5 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\tSevere and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see . In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. In clinical studies enrolling 389 adult patients with cHL who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent, pneumonitis occurred in 31 (8%) patients, including Grades 3-4 pneumonitis in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 21 (5.4%) patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had resolution. In a clinical study enrolling 580 adult patients with resected NSCLC (KEYNOTE-091) who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment, pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA, 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48) of patients with colitis. Additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of colitis. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients with hepatitis. Eleven percent of these patients required additional immunosuppressant therapy. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of hepatitis. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA with Axitinib KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times ULN (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both KEYTRUDA and axitinib. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients with hypophysitis; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Thyroid Disorders KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 2 (0.3%). No patients discontinued KEYTRUDA due to thyroiditis. KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). Hyperthyroidism led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). Hypothyroidism led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 389 patients with cHL (17%) receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, including Grade 1 (6.2%) and Grade 2 (10.8%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which can present with Diabetic Ketoacidosis Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Type 1 diabetes mellitus led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. All patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus required long-term insulin therapy. Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients with nephritis. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of nephritis. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens Johnson Syndrome, DRESS, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), has occurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients with immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (2) of patients and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence of immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, duodenitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection 5.2\tInfusion-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis, which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. Interrupt or slow the rate of infusion for mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) infusion-related reactions. For severe (Grade 3) or life-threatening (Grade 4) infusion-related reactions, stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.3\tComplications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4\tIncreased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when KEYTRUDA is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled trials. 5.5\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling. Severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA as a single agent in 2799 patients in three randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, and KEYNOTE-010), which enrolled 912 patients with melanoma and 682 patients with NSCLC, and one single-arm trial (KEYNOTE-001), which enrolled 655 patients with melanoma and 550 patients with NSCLC. In addition to the 2799 patients, certain subsections in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS describe adverse reactions observed with exposure to KEYTRUDA as a single agent in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-091), which enrolled 580 patients with resected NSCLC, a non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-012), a non-randomized, open-label, single-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-055), and two randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-040 and KEYNOTE-048 single agent arms), which enrolled 909 patients with HNSCC; in two non-randomized, open-label trials (KEYNOTE-013 and KEYNOTE-087) and one randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-204), which enrolled 389 patients with cHL; in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-048 combination arm), which enrolled 276 patients with HNSCC; in combination with axitinib in a randomized, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-426), which enrolled 429 patients with RCC; and in post-marketing use. Across all trials, KEYTRUDA was administered at doses of 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, or 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Among the 2799 patients, 41% were exposed for 6 months or more and 21% were exposed for 12 months or more. Melanoma Ipilimumab-Naive Melanoma The safety of KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who had not received prior ipilimumab and who had received no more than one prior systemic therapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-006. KEYNOTE-006 was a multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial where patients were randomized (1:1:1) and received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=278) or KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=277) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (n=256) [see . Patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C, were ineligible. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] The median duration of exposure was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 11.0 months) for KEYTRUDA and similar in both treatment arms. Fifty-one and 46% of patients received KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks, respectively, for \u22656 months. No patients in either arm received treatment for more than one year. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89); 60% male; 98% White; 32% had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value at baseline; 65% had M1c stage disease; 9% with history of brain metastasis; and approximately 36% had been previously treated with systemic therapy which included a BRAF inhibitor (15%), chemotherapy (13%), and immunotherapy (6%). In KEYNOTE-006, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the every 2 week and every 3 week schedule, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=555) of both KEYTRUDA arms. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA occurred in 9% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (\u22651%) was diarrhea (2.5%). Tables 4 and 5 summarize selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-006.

Ipilimumab-Refractory Melanoma The safety of KEYTRUDA in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor, was investigated in KEYNOTE-002. KEYNOTE-002 was a multicenter, partially blinded (KEYTRUDA dose), randomized (1:1:1), active-controlled trial in which 528 patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (n=178) or 10 mg/kg (n=179) every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=171), consisting of dacarbazine (26%), temozolomide (25%), paclitaxel and carboplatin (25%), paclitaxel (16%), or carboplatin (8%) [see . Patients with autoimmune disease, severe immune-related toxicity related to ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or an active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C, were ineligible. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.7 months (range: 1 day to 16.6 months) and to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 4.8 months (range: 1 day to 16.8 months). In the KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg arm, 36% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for \u22656 months and 4% were exposed for \u226512 months. In the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg arm, 41% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for \u22656 months and 6% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for \u226512 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 15 to 89); 61% male; 98% White; 41% had an elevated LDH value at baseline; 83% had M1c stage disease; 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease (100% received ipilimumab and 25% a BRAF inhibitor); and 15% with history of brain metastasis. In KEYNOTE-002, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg dose and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=357) of both KEYTRUDA arms. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation occurred in 12% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; the most common (\u22651%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 14% of patients; the most common (\u22651%) were dyspnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculo-papular rash (1%). Tables 6 and 7 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on KEYTRUDA in KEYNOTE-002.

Adjuvant Treatment of Resected Stage IIB or IIC Melanoma Among the 969 patients with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma enrolled in KEYNOTE-716 [see treated with KEYTRUDA, the median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 9.9 months (range: 0 to 15.4 months). Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were ineligible. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma were similar to those occurring in 1011 patients with Stage III melanoma from KEYNOTE-054 or the 2799 patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated with KEYTRUDA as a single agent. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Adjuvant Treatment of Stage III Resected Melanoma The safety of KEYTRUDA as a single agent was investigated in KEYNOTE-054, a randomized (1:1) double-blind trial in which 1019 patients with completely resected Stage IIIA (>1 mm lymph node metastasis), IIIB or IIIC melanoma received 200 mg of KEYTRUDA by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (n=509) or placebo (n=502) for up to one year [see . Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were ineligible. Seventy-six percent of patients received KEYTRUDA for 6 months or longer. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] The study population characteristics were: median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 88), 25% age 65 or older; 62% male; and 94% ECOG PS of 0 and 6% ECOG PS of 1. Sixteen percent had Stage IIIA, 46% had Stage IIIB, 18% had Stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes), and 20% had Stage IIIC (\u22654 positive lymph nodes). Two patients treated with KEYTRUDA died from causes other than disease progression; causes of death were drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and autoimmune myositis with respiratory failure. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 14% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA; the most common (\u22651%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 19% of patients; the most common (\u22651%) were diarrhea (2.4%), pneumonitis (2%), increased ALT (1.4%), arthralgia (1.4%), increased AST (1.4%), dyspnea (1%), and fatigue (1%).

A total of 607 patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg, pemetrexed and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by KEYTRUDA and pemetrexed (n=405) or placebo, pemetrexed, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed (n=202). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Clinical Studies (14.2) ] The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks was 7.2 months (range: 1 day to 20.1 months). Sixty percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for \u22656 months. Seventy-two percent of patients received carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; and 18% with history of brain metastases at baseline. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 20% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3%) and acute kidney injury (2%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 53% of patients; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (\u22652%) were neutropenia (13%), asthenia/fatigue (7%), anemia (7%), thrombocytopenia (5%), diarrhea (4%), pneumonia (4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), dyspnea (2%), febrile neutropenia (2%), upper respiratory tract infection (2%), increased ALT (2%), and pyrexia (2%).

Safety data are available for the first 203 patients who received KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy (n=101) or placebo and chemotherapy (n=102). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Clinical Studies (14.2) ] The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 7 months (range: 1 day to 12 months). Sixty-one percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for \u22656 months. A total of 139 of 203 patients (68%) received paclitaxel and 64 patients (32%) received paclitaxel protein-bound in combination with carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 40 to 83), 52% age 65 or older; 78% male; 83% White; and 9% with history of brain metastases. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 15% of patients, with no single type of adverse reaction accounting for the majority. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 43% of patients; the most common (\u22652%) were thrombocytopenia (20%), neutropenia (11%), anemia (6%), asthenia (2%), and diarrhea (2%). The most frequent (\u22652%) serious adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia (6%), pneumonia (6%), and urinary tract infection (3%). The adverse reactions observed in KEYNOTE-407 were similar to those observed in KEYNOTE-189 with the exception that increased incidences of alopecia (47% vs. 36%) and peripheral neuropathy (31% vs. 25%) were observed in the KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy arm compared to the placebo and chemotherapy arm in KEYNOTE-407. Previously Untreated NSCLC The safety of KEYTRUDA was investigated in KEYNOTE-042, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in 1251 patients with PD-L1 expressing, previously untreated Stage III NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation or metastatic NSCLC [see Patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=636) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=615), consisting of pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by optional pemetrexed (n=312) or paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by optional pemetrexed (n=303) every 3 weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations; autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 27.3 months). Forty-eight percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA 200 mg for \u22656 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 25 to 90), 45% age 65 or older; 71% male; and 64% White, 30% Asian, and 2% Black. Nineteen percent were Hispanic or Latino. Eighty-seven percent had metastatic disease (Stage IV), 13% had Stage III disease (2% Stage IIIA and 11% Stage IIIB), and 5% had treated brain metastases at baseline. KEYTRUDA was discontinued for adverse reactions in 19% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA were pneumonitis (3.0%), death due to unknown cause (1.6%), and pneumonia (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 33% of patients; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA (\u22652%) were pneumonitis (3.1%), pneumonia (3.0%), hypothyroidism (2.2%), and increased ALT (2.0%). The most frequent (\u22652%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (7%), pneumonitis (3.9%), pulmonary embolism (2.4%), and pleural effusion (2.2%).

A total of 991 patients received KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg (n=339) or 10 mg/kg (n=343) every 3 weeks or docetaxel (n=309) at 75 mg/m Clinical Studies (14.2) ] 2 every 3 weeks. Patients with autoimmune disease, medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 22.4 months) and to KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.5 months (range 1 day to 20.8 months). The data described below reflect exposure to KEYTRUDA 2 mg/kg in 31% of patients exposed to KEYTRUDA for \u22656 months. In the KEYTRUDA 10 mg/kg arm, 34% of patients were exposed to KEYTRUDA for \u22656 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 20 to 88), 42% age 65 or older; 61% male; 72% White and 21% Asian; and 8% with advanced localized disease, 91% with metastatic disease, and 15% with history of brain metastases. Twenty-nine percent received two or more prior systemic treatments for advanced or metastatic disease. In KEYNOTE-010, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=682). Treatment was discontinued for adverse reactions in 8% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most common adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of KEYTRUDA occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (\u22651%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%).

Of the 325 KEYTRUDA-treated patients who received surgery, 3.1% (n=10) experienced delay of surgery (surgery more than 8 weeks from last neoadjuvant treatment if patient received less than 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy or more than 20 weeks after first dose of neoadjuvant treatment if patient received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy) due to adverse reactions. Of the 317 placebo-treated patients who received surgery, 2.5% (n=8) experienced delay of surgery due to adverse reactions. Of the 325 KEYTRUDA-treated patients who received surgery, 7% (n=22) did not receive adjuvant treatment due to adverse reactions. Of the 317 placebo-treated patients who received surgery, 3.2% (n=10) did not receive adjuvant treatment due to adverse reactions. Adjuvant Phase of KEYNOTE-671 A total of 290 patients in the KEYTRUDA arm and 267 patients in the placebo arm received at least 1 dose of adjuvant treatment. Of the patients who received single agent KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment, 14% experienced serious adverse reactions; the most frequent serious adverse reaction was pneumonia (3.4%). One fatal adverse reaction of pulmonary hemorrhage occurred. Permanent discontinuation of adjuvant KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 12% of patients; the most frequent (\u22651%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation of adjuvant KEYTRUDA were diarrhea (1.7%), interstitial lung disease (1.4%), AST increased (1%), and musculoskeletal pain (1%). Adjuvant Treatment of Resected NSCLC The safety of KEYTRUDA as a single agent was investigated in KEYNOTE-091, a multicenter, randomized (1:1), triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with completely resected Stage IB (T2a \u22654 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC; adjuvant chemotherapy up to 4 cycles was optional [see . A total of 1161 patients received KEYTRUDA 200 mg (n=580) or placebo (n=581) every 3 weeks. Patients were ineligible if they had active autoimmune disease, were on chronic immunosuppressive agents, or had a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Clinical Studies (14.2) ] The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 11.7 months (range: 1 day to 18.9 months). Sixty-eight percent of patients in the KEYTRUDA arm were exposed to KEYTRUDA for \u22656 months. The adverse reactions observed in KEYNOTE-091 were generally similar to those occurring in other patients with NSCLC receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent, with the exception of hypothyroidism (22%), hyperthyroidism (11%), and pneumonitis (7%). Two fatal adverse reactions of myocarditis occurred. Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) First-line treatment of unresectable advanced or metastatic MPM with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy The safety of KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy (either carboplatin or cisplatin) was investigated in KEYNOTE-483, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated, unresectable advanced or metastatic MPM [see .

Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for KEYNOTE-012. Clinical Studies (14.4) ] The study population characteristics were: median age of 60 years (range: 20 to 84), 35% age 65 or older; 83% male; and 77% White, 15% Asian, and 5% Black. Sixty-one percent of patients had two or more lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting, and 95% had prior radiation therapy. Baseline ECOG PS was 0 (30%) or 1 (70%) and 86% had M1 disease. KEYTRUDA was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients receiving KEYTRUDA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar between dosage regimens (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks); therefore, summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in \u226520% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in 2799 patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated with KEYTRUDA as a single agent, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3-4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Relapsed or Refractory cHL KEYNOTE-204 The safety of KEYTRUDA was evaluated in KEYNOTE-204 [see Adults with relapsed or refractory cHL received KEYTRUDA 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks (n=148) or brentuximab vedotin (BV) 1.8 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (n=152). The trial required an ANC \u22651000/\u00b5L, platelet count \u226575,000/\u00b5L, hepatic transaminases \u22642.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), bilirubin \u22641.5 times ULN, and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The trial excluded patients with active non-infectious pneumonitis, prior pneumonitis requiring steroids, active autoimmune disease, a medical condition requiring immunosuppression, or allogeneic HSCT within the past 5 years. The median duration of exposure to KEYTRUDA was 10 months (range: 1 day to 2.2 years), with 68% receiving at least 6 months of treatment and 48% receiving at least 1 year of treatment. Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients who received KEYTRUDA. Serious adverse reactions in \u22651% included pneumonitis, pneumonia, pyrexia, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, febrile neutropenia, and sepsis. Three patients (2%) died from causes other than disease progression: two from complications after allogeneic HSCT and one from unknown cause. Permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients; 7% of patients discontinued treatment due to pneumonitis. Dosage interruption of KEYTRUDA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u22653% of patients were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, transaminase increase, and pneumonia. Thirty-eight percent of patients had an adverse reaction requiring systemic corticosteroid therapy. Table 18 summarizes adverse reactions in KEYNOTE-204.
