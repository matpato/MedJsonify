Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis: Discontinue treatment and evaluate patients. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 : PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk of Clostridium-difficile associated diarrhea. ( -Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile 5.3 ) \u2022 Bone Fracture : Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions: Discontinue at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue lansoprazole delayed-release capsules and refer to specialist for evaluation. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Cyanocobalamin ( Vitamin B12 ) Deficiency: Daily long-term use ( e.g. , longer than 3 years ) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism : Hypomagnesemia has been reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors: Increases in intragastric pH may result in hypergastrinemia and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased chromogranin A levels which may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. ( 5.9 , 7 ) \u2022 Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity. With high-dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules. ( 5.10 , 7 ) \u2022 Fundic Gland Polyps: Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond 1 year. Use the shortest duration of therapy. ( 5.12 ) \u2022 Risk of Heart Valve Thickening in Pediatric Patients Less than One Year of Age: Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules are not recommended in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age. ( 5.13 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Presence of Gastric Malignancy In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy. Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI. In older patients, also consider an endoscopy. 5.2 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis Acute tubulointerstial nephritis ( TIN ) has been observed in patients taking PPIs and may occur at any point during PPI therapy. Patients may present with varying signs and symptoms from symptomatic hypersensitivity reactions to nonspecific symptoms of decreased renal function ( e.g. , malaise, nausea, anorexia ) . In reported case series, some patients were diagnosed on biopsy and in the absence of extra-renal manifestations ( e.g. , fever, rash or arthralgia ) . Discontinue lansoprazole delayed-release capsules and evaluate patients with suspected acute TIN [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.3 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like lansoprazole delayed-release capsules may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) , especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve [see Adverse Reactions ( ] . 6.2 ) Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. For more information specific to antibacterial agents ( clarithromycin and amoxicillin ) indicated for use in combination with lansoprazole delayed release capsules, refer to Warnings and Precautions section of their prescribing information. 5.4 Bone Fracture Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine. The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy ( a year or longer ) . Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines [see Dosage and Administration ( , 2 ) Adverse Reactions ( ] . 6.2 ) 5.5 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) have been reported in association with the use of PPIs [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . Discontinue lansoprazole delayed-release capsules at the first signs or symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions or other signs of hypersensitivity and consider further evaluation. 5.6 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( CLE ) and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including lansoprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE. The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE ( SCLE ) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement. Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than nondrug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported. Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving lansoprazole delayed-release capsules discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in four to 12 weeks. Serological testing ( e.g. , ANA ) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations. 5.7 Cyanocobalamin ( Vitamin B-12 ) Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time ( e.g. , longer than three years ) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin ( Vitamin B12 ) caused by hypo-or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules. 5.8 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia ( e.g. , diuretics ) , healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia ( e.g. , hypoparathyroidism ) . Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI. 5.9 Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors Serum chromogranin A ( CgA ) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop lansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed ( e.g. , for monitoring ) , the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions ] . ( 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 ) 5.10 Interaction with Methotrexate Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate ( primarily at high dose ) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions ] . ( 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) 5.12 Fundic Gland Polyps PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. 5.14 Risk of Heart Valve Thickening in Pediatric Patients Less Than One Year of Age Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules are not approved in pediatric patients less than one year of age. Nonclinical studies in juvenile rats with lansoprazole have demonstrated an adverse effect of heart valve thickening. The risk of heart valve injury does not appear to be relevant to patients one year of age and older [see Use in Specific Populations ( ] . 8.4 )",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling: \u2022 Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Bone Fracture [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] \u2022 Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] \u2022 Cyanocobalamin ( Vitamin B12 ) Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] \u2022 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] \u2022 Fundic Gland Polyps [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ] Most commonly reported adverse reactions ( \u22651% ) : diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and constipation.

Worldwide, over 10.000 patients have been treated with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules in Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials involving various dosages and durations of treatment. In general, lansoprazole delayed-release capsules treatment has been well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term trials. The following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician to have a possible or probable relationship to drug in 1% or more of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules-treated patients and occurred at a greater rate in lansoprazole delayed-release capsules-treated patients than placebo-treated patients in Table 1. Table 1: Incidence of Possibly or Probably Treatment-Related Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules Studies Body System/Adverse Reaction Lansoprazole Delayed-Release Capsules ( N= 2768 ) % Placebo ( N= 1023 ) % Body as a Whole Abdominal Pain 2.1 1.2 Digestive System Constipation Diarrhea Nausea 1.0 3.8 1.3 0.4 2.3 1.2 Headache was also seen at greater than 1% incidence but was more common on placebo. The incidence of diarrhea was similar between patients who received placebo and patients who received 15 and 30 mg of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, but higher in the patients who received 60 mg of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules ( 2.9.1.4.4.2, and 7.4% , respectively ) . The most commonly reported possibly or probably treatment-related adverse event during maintenance therapy was diarrhea. In the risk reduction study of lansoprazole delayed-release capsules for NSAID-associated gastric ulcers, the incidence of diarrhea for patients treated with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, misoprostol, and placebo was 5, 22, and 3% , respectively. Another study for the same indication, where patients took either a COX-2 inhibitor or lansoprazole and naproxen, demonstrated that the safety profile was similar to the prior study. Additional reactions from this study not previously observed in other clinical trials with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules included contusion, duodenitis, epigastric discomfort, esophageal disorder, fatigue, hunger, hiatal hernia, hoarseness, impaired gastric emptying, metaplasia, and renal impairment. Additional adverse experiences occurring in less than 1% of patients or subjects who received lansoprazole delayed-release capsules in domestic trials are shown below: Body as a Whole \u2013 abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, asthenia, back pain, candidiasis, carcinoma, chest pain ( not otherwise specified ) , chills, edema, fever, flu syndrome, halitosis, infection ( not otherwise specified ) , malaise, neck pain, neck rigidity, pain, pelvic pain Cardiovascular System -angina, arrhythmia, bradycardia, cerebrovascular accident/cerebral infarction, hypertension/hypotension, migraine, myocardial infarction, palpitations, shock ( circulatory failure ) , syncope, tachycardia, vasodilation Digestive System \u2013 abnormal stools, anorexia, bezoar, cardiospasm, cholelithiasis, colitis, dry mouth, dyspepsia, dysphagia, enteritis, eructation, esophageal stenosis, esophageal ulcer, esophagitis, fecal discoloration, flatulence, gastric nodules/fundic gland polyps, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal anomaly, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, glossitis, gum hemorrhage, hematemesis, increased appetite, increased salivation, melena, mouth ulceration, nausea and vomiting, nausea and vomiting and diarrhea, gastrointestinal moniliasis, rectal disorder, rectal hemorrhage, stomatitis, tenesmus, thirst, tongue disorder, ulcerative colitis, ulcerative stomatitis Endocrine System -diabetes mellitus, goiter, hypothyroidism Hemic and Lymphatic System -anemia, hemolysis, lymphadenopathy Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders \u2013avitaminosis, gout, dehydration, hyperglycemia/hypoglycemia, peripheral edema, weight gain/loss Musculoskeletal System -arthralgia, arthritis, bone disorder, joint disorder, leg cramps, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, myasthenia, ptosis, synovitis Nervous System \u2013 abnormal dreams, agitation, amnesia, anxiety, apathy, confusion, convulsion, dementia, depersonalization, depression, diplopia, dizziness, emotional lability, hallucinations, hemiplegia, hostility aggravated, hyperkinesia, hypertonia, hypesthesia, insomnia, libido decreased/increased, nervousness, neurosis, paresthesia, sleep disorder, somnolence, thinking abnormality, tremor, vertigo Respiratory System -asthma, bronchitis, cough increased, dyspnea, epistaxis, hemoptysis, hiccup, laryngeal neoplasia, lung fibrosis, pharyngitis, pleural disorder, pneumonia, respiratory disorder, upper respiratory inflammation/infection, rhinitis, sinusitis, stridor Skin and Appendages -acne, alopecia, contact dermatitis, dry skin, fixed eruption, hair disorder, maculopapular rash, nail disorder, pruritus, rash, skin carcinoma, skin disorder, sweating, urticaria Special Senses \u2013 abnormal vision, amblyopia, blepharitis, blurred vision, cataract, conjunctivitis, deafness, dry eyes, ear/eye disorder, eye pain, glaucoma, otitis media, parosmia, photophobia, retinal degeneration/disorder, taste loss, taste perversion, tinnitus, visual field defect Urogenital System -abnormal menses, breast enlargement, breast pain, breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea, dysuria, gynecomastia, impotence, kidney calculus, kidney pain, leukorrhea, menorrhagia, menstrual disorder, penis disorder, polyuria, testis disorder, urethral pain, urinary frequency, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, urinary urgency, urination impaired, vaginitis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse experiences have been reported since lansoprazole delayed-release capsules have been marketed. The majority of these cases are foreign-sourced and a relationship to lansoprazole delayed-release capsules has not been established. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events are listed below by COSTART body system. Body as a Whole \u2013 anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, systemic lupus erythematosus; Digestive System - hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, vomiting; Hemic and Lymphatic System- agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; Infections and Infestations \u2013 Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea; Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders \u2013 hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia; Musculoskeletal System \u2013 bone fracture, myositis; Skin and Appendages \u2013 severe dermatologic reactions including erythema multiforme, SJS/TEN ( some fatal ) , DRESS, AGEP, cutaneous lupus erythematosus; Special Senses -speech disorder; Urogenital System \u2013 interstitial nephritis, urinary retention. 6.3 Combination Therapy with Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin In clinical trials using combination therapy with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, and lansoprazole delayed-release capsules plus amoxicillin, no adverse reactions peculiar to these drug combinations were observed. Adverse reactions that have occurred have been limited to those that had been previously reported with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin. Triple Therapy: Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules /amoxicillin/clarithromycin The most frequently reported adverse reactions for patients who received triple therapy for 14 days were diarrhea ( 7% ) , headache ( 6% ) , and taste perversion ( 5% ) . There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of reported adverse reactions between the 10 and 14 day triple therapy regimens. No treatment-emergent adverse reactions were observed at significantly higher rates with triple therapy than with any dual therapy regimen. Dual Therapy: Lansoprazole delayed-release capsules /amoxicillin The most frequently reported adverse reactions for patients who received lansoprazole delayed-release capsules three times daily plus amoxicillin three times daily dual therapy were diarrhea ( 8% ) and headache ( 7% ) . No treatment-emergent adverse reactions were observed at significantly higher rates with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules three times daily plus amoxicillin three times daily dual therapy than with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules alone. For information about adverse reactions with antibacterial agents ( amoxicillin and clarithromycin ) indicated in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, refer to the Adverse Reactions section of their prescribing information. 6.4 Laboratory Values The following changes in laboratory parameters in patients who received lansoprazole delayed-release capsules were reported as adverse reactions: Abnormal liver function tests, increased SGOT ( AST ) , increased SGPT ( ALT ) , increased creatinine, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased globulins, increased GGTP, increased/decreased/abnormal WBC, abnormal AG ratio, abnormal RBC, bilirubinemia, blood potassium increased, blood urea increased, crystal urine present, eosinophilia, hemoglobin decreased, hyperlipemia, increased/decreased electrolytes, increased/decreased cholesterol, increased glucocorticoids, increased LDH, increased/decreased/abnormal platelets, increased gastrin levels and positive fecal occult blood. Urine abnormalities such as albuminuria, glycosuria, and hematuria were also reported. Additional isolated laboratory abnormalities were reported. In the placebo controlled studies, when SGOT ( AST ) and SGPT ( ALT ) were evaluated, 0.4% ( 4/978 ) and 0.4% ( 11/2677 ) patients, who received placebo and lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, respectively, had enzyme elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal range at the final treatment visit. None of these patients who received lansoprazole delayed-release capsules reported jaundice at any time during the study. In clinical trials using combination therapy with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules plus amoxicillin and clarithromycin, and lansoprazole delayed-release capsules plus amoxicillin, no increased laboratory abnormalities particular to these drug combinations were observed. For information about laboratory value changes with antibacterial agents ( amoxicillin and clarithromycin ) indicated in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules, refer to the Adverse Reactions section of their prescribing information.",
