Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] VORANIGO is an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with Grade 2 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma with a susceptible IDH1 or IDH2 mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test, following surgery including biopsy, sub-total resection, or gross total resection.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver function tests every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, then monthly for the first 2 years of treatment, and as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose or discontinue VORANIGO based on severity. ( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : VORANIGO can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective nonhormonal contraception. ( 5.2 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\tHepatotoxicity VORANIGO can cause hepatic transaminase elevations, which can lead to hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, and autoimmune hepatitis. In the pooled safety population [see , 58% of patients treated with VORANIGO experienced increased ALT and 44% of patients experienced increased AST. Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT or AST occurred in 9% and 4.8% of patients respectively. Among these patients, 4.1% (10/244) had concurrent Grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST elevations. A total of 34% of patients treated with VORANIGO had increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), of these 2.2% were Grade 3 or 4. Bilirubin increases occurred in 4.8% of patients treated with VORANIGO, with 0.4% Grade 3 or 4. Nine percent of patients treated with VORANIGO had increased alkaline phosphatase, with 0.9% Grade 3 or 4. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Two patients met the laboratory criteria for Hy's Law and had concurrent elevations in ALT or AST >3 times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of normal; these events were associated with cases of autoimmune hepatitis and hepatic failure. The median time to first onset of increased ALT or AST was 57 days (range: 1 to 1049). Permanent discontinuation of VORANIGO was required for 2.9% of patients with ALT elevations, 1.6% of AST elevations, and 0.4% of GGT elevations. Dosage reductions of VORANIGO were required for 7% of patients with ALT elevations, 1.2% of AST elevations, and 0.4% of GGT elevations. Dosage interruptions were required in 14% of patients with ALT elevations, 6% of AST elevations, and 1.6% of GGT elevations. Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) prior to the start of VORANIGO, every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment, then monthly for the first 2 years of treatment, and as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations. Reduce the dose, withhold, or permanently discontinue VORANIGO based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.2\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies, VORANIGO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal embryo-fetal development studies, oral administration of vorasidenib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicities at doses \u226545 times the human exposure based on the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) at the highest recommended dose. Oral administration of vorasidenib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at doses \u22658 times the human exposure based on the AUC at the highest recommended dose. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective nonhormonal contraception during treatment with VORANIGO and for 3 months after the last dose, since VORANIGO can render some hormonal contraceptives ineffective [see . Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VORANIGO and for 3 months after the last dose Drug Interactions (7.2) ] [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most common (\u226515%) adverse reactions include fatigue, headache, COVID-19, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and seizure. Grade 3 or 4 (\u22652%) laboratory abnormalities were ALT increased, AST increased, GGT increased, and neutrophils decreased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Servier Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-807-6124 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to VORANIGO 40 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in the 244 patients with astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma with susceptible IDH1 or IDH2 mutation in trials AG881-C-002 (NCT02481154, n=11), AG120-881-001 (NCT03343197, n=14) and INDIGO (NCT04164901, n=167 randomized patients and n=52 crossover patients). Among the 244 patients who received VORANIGO, 78% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 44% were exposed for greater than one year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (\u226515%) adverse reactions were fatigue (33%), headache (28%), COVID-19 (28%), musculoskeletal pain (24%), diarrhea (21%), nausea (20%), and seizure (16%). In this pooled safety population, the most common (\u22652%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were increased ALT (9%), increased AST (4.8%), increased GGT (2.2%), and decreased neutrophils (2.2%). INDIGO The safety of VORANIGO was evaluated in 330 patients with Grade 2 astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma with an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation who received at least one dose of either VORANIGO 40 mg daily (N=167) or placebo (N=163) in the INDIGO trial [see . Patients received VORANIGO 40 mg orally once daily or placebo orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among the 167 patients who were randomized and received VORANIGO, the median duration of exposure to VORANIGO was 12.7 months (range: 1 to 30 months) with 153 patients (92%) exposed to VORANIGO for at least 6 months and 89 (53%) exposed for at least 1 year. Clinical Studies (14) ] The demographics of patients randomized to VORANIGO were: median age 41 years (range: 21 to 71 years); 60% male, 74% White, 20% race not reported, 3% Asian, and 1.2% Black or African American; and 5% were Hispanic or Latino. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 7% of patients who received VORANIGO. The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in \u22652% of patients who received VORANIGO includes seizure (3%). Permanent discontinuation of VORANIGO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 3.6% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of VORANIGO in \u22652% of patients included ALT increased (3%). Dosage interruptions of VORANIGO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose interruption in \u22655% of patients included ALT increased (14%), COVID-19 (9%), and AST increased (6%). Dose reductions of VORANIGO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reduction in \u22655% of patients included ALT increased (8%). The most common (\u226515%) adverse reactions were fatigue (37%), COVID-19 (33%), musculoskeletal pain (26%), diarrhea (25%), and seizure (16%). Grade 3 or 4 (\u22652%) laboratory abnormalities were ALT increased (10%), AST increased (4.8%), GGT increased (3%) and neutrophil decreased (2.4%).
