    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE MICARDIS HCT (telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with MICARDIS HCT. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. MICARDIS HCT is not indicated for initial therapy for the treatment of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. MICARDIS HCT may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. MICARDIS HCT is a combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a thiazide diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive agents, to lower blood pressure.  Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1 ) MICARDIS HCT is not indicated for initial therapy ( 1 )",

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Avoid fetal or neonatal exposure ( 5.1 ) Correct volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy.  Observe for signs and symptoms of hypotension. ( 5.2 ) Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients ( 5.3 ) Observe for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance ( 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity Reaction ( 5.5 ) Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma ( 5.6 ) 5.1\tFetal Toxicity Telmisartan Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue MICARDIS HCT as soon as possible. Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. Adverse reactions include fetal or neonatal jaundice and thrombocytopenia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2\tHypotension in Volume- or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initialization of treatment with MICARDIS HCT. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of MICARDIS HCT. 5.3\tImpaired Renal Function Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia, or acute renal failure on MICARDIS HCT. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on MICARDIS HCT. 5.4\tElectrolytes and Metabolic Disorders Drugs, including telmisartan, that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes, or combination use with other angiotensin receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels [see . Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.4) ] Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.  Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. In controlled trials using the telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination treatment, no patient administered 40 mg/12.5 mg, 80 mg/12.5 mg, or 80 mg/25 mg experienced a decrease in potassium \u22651.4 mEq/L, and no patient experienced hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy. Because telmisartan decreases uric acid, telmisartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide attenuates the diuretic-induced hyperuricemia. 5.5\tHypersensitivity Reaction Hydrochlorothiazide Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history [see Contraindications (4) ]. 5.6\tAcute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. 5.7\tSystemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.8\tPostsympathectomy Patients The antihypertensive effects of hydrochlorothiazide may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.",

No patient discontinued treatment with MICARDIS HCT tablets because of an increase in BUN or creatinine [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MICARDIS HCT.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Eosinophilia Cardiac Disorders: Tachycardia Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Vertigo General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Asthenia, edema Hepato-biliary: Abnormal hepatic function/liver disorder Immune System Disorders: Anaphylactic reaction Investigations: Increased CPK Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Hypoglycemia (in diabetic patients), hyponatremia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: Headache, syncope Renal and Urinary Disorders: Renal failure, renal impairment including acute renal failure Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Erectile dysfunction Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Coughing Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Angioedema (with fatal outcome), drug eruption (toxic skin eruption mostly reported as toxicoderma, rash, and urticaria) Vascular Disorder: Orthostatic hypotension Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of \u226550,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.",
