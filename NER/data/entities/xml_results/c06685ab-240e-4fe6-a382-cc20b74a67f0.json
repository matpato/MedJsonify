Known hypersensitivity to allopurinol or to any of the ingredients of allopurinol.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Skin Rash and Hypersensitivity: Allopurinol has been associated with serious and sometimes fatal dermatological reactions. Discontinue allopurinol at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity reaction. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Gout Flares: May occur during initiation of treatment. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with colchicine or anti-inflammatory agents is recommended. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Nephrotoxicity: Allopurinol may affect kidney function. Patients with decreased kidney function require lower doses of allopurinol. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hepatoxicity: Cases of reversible hepatotoxicity have occurred. If signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity develop, evaluate liver function. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Myelosuppression: Bone marrow suppression has been reported with allopurinol. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Potential Effect on Driving and Use of Machinery: Drowsiness, somnolence and dizziness have been reported in patients taking allopurinol. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Skin Rash and Hypersensitivity Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients taking allopurinol [see Adverse Reactions ( . These reactions occur in approximately 5 in 10,000 (0.05%) patients taking allopurinol. Other serious hypersensitivity reactions that have been reported include exfoliative, urticarial and purpuric lesions, generalized vasculitis, and irreversible hepatotoxicity. Discontinue allopurinol permanently at the first appearance of skin rash or other signs which may indicate a hypersensitivity reaction. 6 )] The HLA-B*58:01 allele is a genetic marker for severe skin reactions indicative of hypersensitivity to allopurinol. Patients who carry the HLA-B*58:01 allele are at a higher risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS), but hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients who do not carry this allele. The frequency of this allele is higher in individuals of African, Asian (e.g., Han Chinese, Korean, Thai), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander ancestry [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . The use of allopurinol is not recommended in HLA- B*58:01 positive patients unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. 12.5 )] Consider screening for HLA-B*5801 before starting treatment with allopurinol in patients from populations in which the prevalence of this HLA-B*5801 allele is known to be high. Screening is generally not recommended in patients from populations in which the prevalence of HLA-B*58:01 is low, or in current allopurinol users, as the risk of SJS/TEN/DRESS is largely confined to the first few months of therapy, regardless of HLA- B*58:01 status. Hypersensitivity reactions to allopurinol may be increased in patients with decreased kidney function receiving thiazide diuretics and allopurinol concurrently. Concomitant use of the following drugs may also increase the risk of skin rash, which may be severe: bendamustine, ampicillin and amoxicillin [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 )] Discontinue allopurinol immediately if a skin rash develops. Instruct patients to stop taking allopurinol tablets immediately and seek medical attention promptly if they develop a rash. 5.2 Gout Flares Gout flares have been reported during initiation of treatment with allopurinol, even when normal or subnormal serum uric acid levels have been attained due to the mobilization of urates from tissue deposits. Even with adequate therapy with allopurinol, it may require several months to deplete the uric acid pool sufficiently to achieve control of the flares. The flares typically become shorter and less severe after several months of therapy. In order to prevent gout flares when treatment with allopurinol is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with colchicine or an anti-inflammatory agent is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( Advise patients to continue allopurinol and prophylactic treatment even if gout flares occur, as it may take months to achieve control of gout flares. 2.2 )]. 5.3 Nephrotoxicity Treatment with allopurinol may result in acute kidney injury due to formation of xanthine calculi or due to precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents. Patients with pre-existing kidney disease, including chronic kidney disease or history of kidney stones, may be at increased risk for worsening of kidney function or acute kidney injury due to xanthine calculi while receiving treatment with allopurinol. In patients receiving allopurinol for the management of gout or the management of recurrent calcium oxalate calculi, monitor kidney function frequently during the early stages of allopurinol administration. Maintain fluid intake sufficient to yield a urinary output of at least 2 liters per day of neutral or, preferably, slightly alkaline urine to avoid the possibility of formation of xanthine calculi and help prevent renal precipitation of urates in patients receiving concomitant uricosuric agents. In patients receiving allopurinol for the management of tumor lysis syndrome, monitor kidney function at least daily during the early stages of allopurinol administration. Maintain fluid intake sufficient to yield a urinary output of at least 2 liters per day in adults and at least 2 liters/m 2 /day (or at least 100 mL/m 2 /hour) in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Cases of reversible clinical hepatotoxicity have occurred in patients taking allopurinol, and in some patients, asymptomatic rises in serum alkaline phosphatase or serum transaminase have been observed. If anorexia, weight loss, or pruritus develop in patients on allopurinol, evaluate liver enzymes. In patients with pre-existing liver disease, monitor liver enzymes periodically. Discontinue allopurinol in patients with elevated liver enzymes. 5.5 Myelosuppression Myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, has been reported in patients receiving allopurinol. The cytopenias have occurred as early as 6 weeks up to 6 years after the initiation of therapy of allopurinol. Concomitant use of allopurinol with cytotoxic drugs associated with myelosuppression may increase the risk of myelosuppression. Monitor blood counts more frequently when cytotoxic drugs are used concomitantly [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.2 )] Concomitant use with allopurinol increases the exposure of either mercaptopurine or azathioprine which may increase the risk of myelosuppression. Reduce the dosage of mercaptopurine or azathioprine as recommended in their respective prescribing information when used concomitantly with allopurinol [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.2 )] 5.6 Potential Effect on Driving and Use of Machinery Drowsiness, somnolence and dizziness have been reported in patients taking allopurinol [see Adverse Reactions ( . Inform patients also that the central nervous system depressant effects of allopurinol may be additive to those of alcohol and other CNS depressants. 6 )] Advise patients to avoid operation of automobiles or other dangerous machinery and activities made hazardous by decreased alertness when starting allopurinol or increasing the dose, until they know how the drug affects them.",
