Confirm normal LVEF before starting lapatinib and continue evaluations during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Lapatinib has been associated with hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver function tests before initiation of treatment, every 4 to 6 weeks during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Discontinue and do not restart lapatinib if patients experience severe changes in liver function tests. ( 5.2 ) Dose reduction in patients with severe hepatic impairment should be considered. ( 2.2 , 5.3 , 8.7 ) Diarrhea, including severe diarrhea, has been reported during treatment. Manage with antidiarrheal agents, and replace fluids and electrolytes if severe. ( 5.4 ) Lapatinib has been associated with interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis. Discontinue lapatinib if patients experience severe pulmonary symptoms. ( 5.5 ) Lapatinib may prolong the QT interval in some patients. Consider electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrolyte monitoring. ( 5.6, 12.2 ) Severe cutaneous reactions have been reported. Discontinue lapatinib if life-threatening reactions are suspected. ( 5.7 ) Lapatinib can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.8 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Decreased Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Lapatinib has been reported to decrease LVEF [see Adverse Reactions ( . In clinical trials, the majority (greater than 57%) of LVEF decreases occurred within the first 12 weeks of treatment; however, data on long-term exposure are limited. Caution should be taken if lapatinib is to be administered to patients with conditions that could impair left ventricular function. LVEF should be evaluated in all patients prior to initiation of treatment with lapatinib to ensure that the patient has a baseline LVEF that is within the institution\u2019s normal limits. LVEF should continue to be evaluated during treatment with lapatinib to ensure that LVEF does not decline below the institution\u2019s normal limits 6.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hepatotoxicity Hepatotoxicity [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin greater than 2 times the ULN] has been observed in clinical trials (less than 1% of patients) and postmarketing experience. The hepatotoxicity may be severe and deaths have been reported. Causality of the deaths is uncertain. The hepatotoxicity may occur days to several months after initiation of treatment. Liver function tests (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) should be monitored before initiation of treatment, every 4 to 6 weeks during treatment, and as clinically indicated. If changes in liver function are severe, therapy with lapatinib should be discontinued and patients should not be retreated with lapatinib [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patients With Severe Hepatic Impairment If lapatinib is to be administered to patients with severe preexisting hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered [see Dosage and Administration . In patients who develop severe hepatotoxicity while on therapy, lapatinib should be discontinued and patients should not be retreated with lapatinib (2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] 5.4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Diarrhea Diarrhea has been reported during treatment with lapatinib [see Adverse Reactions ( . The diarrhea may be severe, and deaths have been reported. Diarrhea generally occurs early during treatment with lapatinib, with almost half of those patients with diarrhea first experiencing it within 6 days. This usually lasts 4 to 5 days. Lapatinib-induced diarrhea is usually low-grade, with severe diarrhea of NCI CTCAE Grades 3 and 4 occurring in less than 10% and less than 1% of patients, respectively. Early identification and intervention is critical for the optimal management of diarrhea. Patients should be instructed to report any change in bowel patterns immediately. Prompt treatment of diarrhea with antidiarrheal agents (such as loperamide) after the first unformed stool is recommended. Severe cases of diarrhea may require administration of oral or intravenous electrolytes and fluids, use of antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones (especially if diarrhea is persistent beyond 24 hours, there is fever, or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia), and interruption or discontinuation of therapy with lapatinib 6.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis Lapatinib has been associated with interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis in monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies [see Adverse Reactions ( . Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Lapatinib should be discontinued in patients who experience pulmonary symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis, which are greater than or equal to Grade 3 (NCI CTCAE v3.0). 6.1 )] 5.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0QT Prolongation A concentration-dependent QT prolongation has been associated with lapatinib [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Monitor patients who have or may develop prolongation of QTc during treatment with lapatinib. These conditions include patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, with congenital long QT syndrome, patients taking antiarrhythmic medicines or other medicinal products with known risk for QT prolongation/Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and cumulative high-dose anthracycline therapy. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to lapatinib administration. 12.2 )] 5.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions have been reported with lapatinib. If life-threatening reactions, such as erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis (e.g., progressive skin rash often with blisters or mucosal lesions) are suspected, discontinue treatment with lapatinib. 5.8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal studies, lapatinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproductive studies, administration of lapatinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis and through lactation led to death of offspring within the first 4 days after birth at maternal exposures that were \u2265 3.3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC following 1,250 mg dose of lapatinib plus capecitabine. When administered to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis, lapatinib caused fetal anomalies (rats) or abortions (rabbits) at maternally toxic doses (with maternal exposures approximately 6.4 and 0.2 times, respectively, the human clinical exposure based on AUC following 1,250 mg dose of lapatinib plus capecitabine). Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology ( . Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of lapatinib.

HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer : The safety of lapatinib has been evaluated in more than 12,000 patients in clinical trials. The efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with capecitabine in breast cancer was evaluated in 198 patients in a randomized, Phase 3 trial [see Clinical Studies ( . Adverse reactions, which occurred in at least 10% of patients in either treatment arm and were higher in the combination arm, are shown in Table 1. 14.1 )] The most common adverse reactions (greater than 20%) during therapy with lapatinib plus capecitabine were gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), dermatologic (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and rash), and fatigue. Diarrhea was the most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of study medication. The most common Grades 3 and 4 adverse reactions (NCI CTCAE v3.0) were diarrhea and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. Selected laboratory abnormalities are shown in Table 2. Table 1.

In this trial, the safety profile of the treatment groups was consistent with the known safety of these agents. The most frequent study treatment-related AEs (> 10%) in each of the lapatinib-containing treatment arms were diarrhea, rash, paronychia, nausea, stomatitis, dermatitis acneiform, and decreased appetite, which were infrequent to absent in the trastuzumab treatment arm. The frequency of cardiac AEs (mostly decrease in ejection fraction) was 7% in the lapatinib+trastuzumab+AI group, 2% in the lapatinib+AI group and 3% in the trastuzumab+AI group.

LVEF decreases were defined as signs or symptoms of deterioration in left ventricular cardiac function that are greater than or equal to Grade 3 (NCI CTCAE v3.0), or a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction relative to baseline which is below the institution's lower limit of normal. Among 198 patients who received combination treatment with lapatinib/capecitabine, 3 experienced Grade 2 and one had Grade 3 LVEF adverse reactions (NCI CTCAE v3.0). Among 654 patients who received combination treatment with lapatinib/letrozole, 26 patients experienced Grade 1 or 2 and 6 patients had Grade 3 or 4 LVEF adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 )] Hepatotoxicity : Lapatinib has been associated with hepatotoxicity [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis : Lapatinib has been associated with interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis in monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapies [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.5 )] 6.2     Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lapatinib. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Nail disorders, including paronychia. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), skin fissures. Cardiac Disorders : Ventricular arrhythmias/Torsades de Pointes (TdP).
