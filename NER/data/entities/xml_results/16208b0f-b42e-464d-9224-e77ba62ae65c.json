    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Matzim LA (diltiazem hydrochloride) extended-release tablets are a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker indicated for treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. It can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensives. ( 1.1 ) improving exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Hypertension Matzim LA (diltiazem hydrochloride) extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including this drug. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Matzim LA (diltiazem hydrochloride) extended-release tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications. 1.2 Angina Matzim LA (diltiazem hydrochloride) extended-release tablets are indicated to improve exercise tolerance in patients with chronic stable angina.",

( 5.2 ) Increased liver enzymes and acute hepatic injury. ( 5.3 ) Severe skin reactions. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Bradycardia or AV Block Matzim LA (diltiazem hydrochloride) extended-release tablets may cause abnormally slow heart rates or second- or third-degree AV block. Patients with sick sinus syndrome are at increased risk of bradycardia. Concomitant use of diltiazem with beta-blockers or digitalis may result in additive effects on cardiac conduction. A patient with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina developed periods of asystole (2 to 5 seconds) after a single dose of 60 mg of diltiazem [see . Monitor for effects on heart rate and cardiac conduction. Adverse Reactions (6) ] 5.2 Heart Failure Worsening of heart failure has been reported in patients with impairment of ventricular function. Experience with the use of diltiazem in combination with beta-blockers in patients with impaired ventricular function is limited. 5.3 Acute Hepatic Injury Significant elevations in liver enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, LDH, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) and signs of acute hepatic injury have been reported with diltiazem therapy. These reactions tended to occur early after therapy initiation (1 to 8 weeks) and have been reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy. Mild elevations of transaminases with and without concomitant elevation in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin have also been observed. Such elevations were usually transient and frequently resolved even with continued diltiazem treatment. 5.4 Severe Skin Reactions Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme and/or exfoliative dermatitis have been reported.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail, in other sections: Bradycardia and AV block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute hepatic injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Severe skin reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) are lower limb edema, sinus congestion and rash in patients treated for hypertension, and lower limb edema, headache, dizziness, fatigue, bradycardia, first-degree AV block and cough in patients treated for angina. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. For the hypertension studies, the following table presents adverse reactions more common on diltiazem than on placebo (but excluding events with no plausible relationship to treatment), as reported in placebo-controlled hypertension trials in patients receiving a diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release formulation (once-a-day dosing) up to 540 mg. Adverse Reactions (MedDRA Term) Placebo Diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release n=120 # pts. (%) 120-360 mg n=501 # pts. (%) 540 mg n=123 # pts. (%) Edema lower limb 4 (3) 24 (5) 10 (8) Sinus congestion 0 (0) 2 (1) 2 (2) Rash 0 (0) 3 (1) 2 (2) In the angina study, the adverse event profile of diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release tablets\u00a0was consistent with what has been previously described for diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release tablets\u00a0and other formulations of diltiazem HCl. The most frequent adverse effects experienced by diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release tablets-treated patients were edema lower-limb (6.8%), dizziness (6.4%), fatigue (4.8%), bradycardia (3.6%), first-degree atrioventricular block (3.2%), and cough (2%). In addition, the following events have been reported infrequently (less than 1%) in angina or hypertension trials: Cardiovascular: Angina, bundle branch block, palpitations, syncope, tachycardia, ventricular extrasystoles [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2 ) ] Nervous System: Abnormal dreams, amnesia, depression, gait abnormality, hallucinations, insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, personality change, somnolence, tinnitus, tremor. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, dysgeusia, dyspepsia, thirst, vomiting, weight increase. Dermatological: Petechiae, photosensitivity, pruritus, urticaria [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Other: Amblyopia, CPK increase, dyspnea, epistaxis, eye irritation, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, impotence, muscle cramps, nasal congestion, nocturia, osteoarticular pain, polyuria, sexual difficulties. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of diltiazem. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following post-marketing reactions have been reported infrequently in patients receiving diltiazem: acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, allergic reactions, alopecia, angioedema (including facial or periorbital edema), erythema multiforme, extrapyramidal symptoms, gingival hyperplasia, hemolytic anemia, increased bleeding time, leukopenia, photosensitivity (including lichenoid keratosis and hyperpigmentation at sun-exposed skin areas), purpura, retinopathy, myopathy, and thrombocytopenia. In addition, events such as myocardial infarction have been observed which are not readily distinguishable from the natural history of the disease in these patients. A number of well-documented cases of generalized rash, some characterized as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, have been reported.",
