    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Guanfacine extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Guanfacine extended-release tablets are a central alpha 2A -adrenergic receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications (1, 14).",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Guanfacine is contraindicated in patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction to guanfacine extended-release tablets or its inactive ingredients, or other products containing guanfacine. Rash and pruritus have been reported. History of hypersensitivity to guanfacine, its inactive ingredients, or other products containing guanfacine (4).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension, bradycardia, syncope: Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension, heart block, bradycardia, syncope, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure. Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated. Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated (5.1). Sedation and somnolence: Occur commonly with guanfacine. Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to guanfacine (5.2). Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities: May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently (5.3). Rebound Hypertension: Abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine can lead to clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension. Subsequent hypertensive encephalopathy was also reported. To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of guanfacine should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days (5.4). 5.1 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Syncope Treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets can cause dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy, following dose increases, and periodically while on therapy. Titrate guanfacine slowly in patients with a history of hypotension, and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia; e.g., heart block, bradycardia, cardiovascular disease, vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or chronic renal failure. In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or dehydration, advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate, and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope. 5.2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Before using guanfacine extended-release tablets with other centrally active depressants, consider the potential for additive sedative effects. Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended-release tablets . Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol. 5.3 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of guanfacine may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular (AV) block, especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs. Titrate guanfacine slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs. 5.4 Rebound Hypertension In post marketing experience, abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets has resulted in clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension above baseline levels and increases in heart rate. Hypertensive encephalopathy has also been reported in association with rebound hypertension with both guanfacine extended-release and immediate release guanfacine [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . In these cases, high-dosage guanfacine was discontinued; concomitant stimulant use was also reported, which may potentially increase hypertensive response upon abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets. Children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting, and a resulting inability to take medications, so they may be especially at risk for rebound hypertension. To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation, the total daily dose of guanfacine should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . Blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing guanfacine extended-release tablets. If abrupt discontinuation occurs (especially with concomitant stimulant use), patients should be closely followed for rebound hypertension.",

The data described below reflect clinical trial exposure to guanfacine in 2,825 patients. This includes 2,330 patients from completed studies in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17 years and 495 patients in completed studies in adult healthy volunteers. The mean duration of exposure of 446 patients that previously participated in two 2-year, open-label long-term studies was approximately 10 months.

Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate In the monotherapy pediatric, short-term, controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2), the maximum mean changes from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were \u22125.4 mmHg, \u22123.4 mmHg, and \u22125.5 bpm, respectively, for all doses combined (generally one week after reaching target doses). For the respective fixed doses 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 3 mg/day or 4 mg/day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were -4.3 mmHg, -5.5 mmHg, -5.4 mmHg and -8.2 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were -3.4 mmHg, -3.3 mmHg, -4.4 mmHg and -5.4 mmHg. For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were -4.8 bpm, -3.1 bpm, -6.5 bpm and -8.6 bpm. Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic; however, hypotension and bradycardia can occur. Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7% of the guanfacine group and 3% of the placebo group. This includes orthostatic hypotension, which was reported for 1% of the guanfacine group and none in the placebo group. These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials (Studies 4 and 5). In the adjunctive trial, hypotension (3%) and bradycardia (2%) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine as compared to none in the placebo group. In long-term, open-label studies, (mean exposure of approximately 10 months), maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy. Decreases were less pronounced over time. Syncope occurred in 1% of pediatric patients in the clinical program. The majority of these cases occurred in the long-term, open-label studies. Discontinuation of Treatment Blood pressure and pulse may increase above baseline values following discontinuation of guanfacine. In five studies of children and adolescents [see Clinical Studies (14)] , increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaging approximately 3 mmHg and increases in heart rate averaging 5 beats per minute above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation with tapering of guanfacine. In a maintenance of efficacy study, increases in blood pressure and heart rate above baseline slowly diminished over the follow up period, which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose; the estimated average time to return to baseline was between six and twelve months. In this study, the increases in blood pressure and pulse were not considered serious or associated with adverse events. However, individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes. In postmarketing experience, following abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine, rebound hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)] . Effects on Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) Patients taking guanfacine demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data. Patients taking guanfacine had a mean increase in weight of 0.5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period. Patients receiving guanfacine for at least 12 months in open-label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm (3 in) in height. The height, weight, and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long-term studies compared to when they began receiving guanfacine. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Table 13 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short-term, placebo-controlled and long-term, open-label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6.1, listed by organ system. Table 13: Other adverse reactions observed in clinical studies Body System Adverse Reaction Cardiac Atrioventricular block General Asthenia, chest pain Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity Investigations Increased alanine amino transferase Nervous system Convulsion Renal Increased urinary frequency Vascular Hypertension, pallor 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of guanfacine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Less frequent, possibly guanfacine-related events observed in the post-marketing study and/or reported spontaneously, not included in section 6.1, include: edema, malaise, tremor General: palpitations, tachycardia, rebound hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy Cardiovascular: paresthesias, vertigo Central Nervous System: blurred vision Eye Disorders: arthralgia, leg cramps, leg pain, myalgia Musculo-Skeletal System: confusion, hallucinations Psychiatric: erectile dysfunction Reproductive System, Male: dyspnea Respiratory System: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, pruritus, rash Skin and Appendages: alterations in taste Special Senses:",
