    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Levocarnitine oral solution is indicated in the treatment of primary systemic carnitine deficiency. In the reported cases, the clinical presentation consisted of recurrent episodes of Reye-like encephalopathy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and/or cardiomyopathy. Associated symptoms included hypotonia, muscle weakness and failure to thrive. A diagnosis of primary carnitine deficiency requires that serum, red cell and/or tissue carnitine levels be low and that the patient does not have a primary defect in fatty acid or organic acid oxidation (see ). In some patients, particularly those presenting with cardiomyopathy, carnitine supplementation rapidly alleviated signs and symptoms. Treatment should include, in addition to carnitine, supportive and other therapy as indicated by the condition of the patient. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Levocarnitine oral solution is also indicated for the acute and chronic treatment of patients with an inborn error of metabolism which results in a secondary carnitine deficiency.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS None known.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, and facial edema have been reported with oral levocarnitine. Other serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, laryngeal edema, and bronchospasm have been reported following intravenous levocarnitine administration, mostly in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis. Discontinue use of levocarnitine and instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction.PRECAUTIONS General Levocarnitine oral solution is for oral/internal use only. Not for parenteral use. Gastrointestinal reactions may result from a too rapid consumption of carnitine. Levocarnitine oral solution may be consumed alone, or dissolved in drinks or other liquid foods to reduce taste fatigue. They should be consumed slowly and doses should be spaced evenly throughout the day to maximize tolerance. The safety and efficacy of oral levocarnitine have not been evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. Chronic administration of high doses of oral levocarnitine in patients with severely compromised renal function or in ESRD patients on dialysis may result in accumulation of the potentially toxic metabolites, trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), since these metabolites are normally excreted in the urine. Drug Interactions Reports of INR increase with the use of warfarin have been observed. It is recommended that INR levels be monitored in patients on warfarin therapy after the initiation of treatment with levocarnitine or after dose adjustments. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Mutagenicity tests performed in Salmonella typhimurium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe indicate that levocarnitine is not mutagenic. No long-term animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of levocarnitine. Pregnancy Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 3.8 times the human dose on the basis of surface area and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to levocarnitine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Levocarnitine supplementation in nursing mothers has not been specifically studied. Studies in dairy cows indicate that the concentration of levocarnitine in milk is increased following exogenous administration of levocarnitine. In nursing mothers receiving levocarnitine, any risks to the child of excess carnitine intake need to be weighed against the benefits of levocarnitine supplementation to the mother. Consideration may be given to discontinuation of nursing or of levocarnitine treatment. Pediatric Use See . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of oral formulations of levocarnitine were identified in clinical trials or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency, reliability, or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Reactions : Various mild gastrointestinal complaints have been reported during the long-term administration of oral L- or D,L-carnitine; these include transient nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions with levocarnitine oral solution dissolved in liquids might be avoided by a slow consumption of the solution or by a greater dilution. Decreasing the dosage often diminishes or eliminates drug-related patient body odor or gastrointestinal symptoms when present. Tolerance should be monitored very closely during the first week of administration and after any dosage increases. Musculoskeletal Reactions : Mild myasthenia has been described only in uremic patients receiving D,L-carnitine. Neurologic Reactions : Seizures have been reported to occur in patients with or without pre-existing seizure activity receiving either oral or intravenous levocarnitine. In patients with pre-existing seizure activity, an increase in seizure frequency and/or severity has been reported. Hypersensitivity Reactions : Rash, urticaria, and facial edema have been reported with oral levocarnitine (see ).
