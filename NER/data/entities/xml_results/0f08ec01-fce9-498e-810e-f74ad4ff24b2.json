Limitations of Use Glycopyrrolate is not indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of peptic ulcer because effectiveness in peptic ulcer healing has not been established. Glycopyrrolate is anticholinergics indicated in adults to reduce symptoms of a peptic ulcer as an adjunct to treatment of peptic ulcer. Limitations of Use: Not indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of peptic ulcer because effectiveness in peptic ulcer healing has not been established.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Glycopyrrolate tablets are contraindicated in: \u2022 Patients at risk for anticholinergic toxicity due to an underlying medical condition, including: o Glaucoma [ ] see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) o Obstructive uropathies, including prostatic hypertrophy o Mechanical obstructive diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., pyloroduodenal stenosis, strictures) [ ] see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) o Gastrointestinal motility disorders (e.g., achalasia, paralytic ileus, intestinal atony) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] o Bleeding gastrointestinal ulcer o Active inflammatory or infectious colitis which can lead to toxic megacolon o History of or current toxic megacolon o Myasthenia gravis \u2022 Patients with a hypersensitivity to glycopyrrolate or any of the inactive ingredients in glycopyrrolate tablets [ ]. see Adverse Reactions (6) and Description (11) \u2022 Patients at risk for anticholinergic toxicity due to various underlying medical conditions. ( 4 , 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity to glycopyrrolate or the inactive ingredients. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Precipitation of Acute Glaucoma: May increase intraocular pressure; if symptoms occur, discontinue use and promptly seek medical care. ( 4 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Partial or Complete Mechanical Intestinal Obstruction: Diarrhea may be an early symptom, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. If the obstruction is suspected, discontinue use and\u00a0evaluate the patient for obstruction. ( 4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 GI Adverse Reactions Due to Decreased GI Motility: Delayed gastric emptying, constipation, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction may occur and precipitate or aggravate paralytic ileus and toxic megacolon; not recommended for use with anticholinergics or other medications that decrease GI peristalsis. ( 4 , 5.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Cognitive and Visual Adverse Reactions: May impair mental and/or physical function. Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or perform other hazardous tasks until reasonably certain they are not adversely affected; discontinue use if signs or symptoms develop. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Heat Prostration at High Environmental Temperatures: Heat prostration resulting in fever and heatstroke can occur, especially in geriatric patients. Avoid exposure to hot or very warm environmental temperatures. ( 5.5 , 5.7 ) \u2022 Other Conditions Exacerbated by Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions: Use is not recommended in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, cardiac disease, hiatal hernia, etc. ( 5.6 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Increased Risk of Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Geriatric Patients: Complications include urinary retention, bowel obstruction, heat prostration, arrhythmias, delirium, and falls or fractures. Not recommended in geriatric patients and may be contraindicated in some patients with underlying medical conditions. ( 4 , 5.7 , 8.5 ) 5.1\tPrecipitation of Acute Glaucoma Glycopyrrolate may cause increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma and reduce the effects of antiglaucoma agents. Instruct patients to discontinue glycopyrrolate tablets and promptly seek medical care if they experience symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma (pain and reddening of the eyes accompanied by dilated pupils) [ ]. see Contraindications (4) 5.2\tPartial or Complete Mechanical Intestinal Obstruction Glycopyrrolate may worsen intestinal mechanical obstruction, and diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. If partial or complete intestinal obstruction is suspected, discontinue the use of glycopyrrolate tablets and evaluate for potential intestinal obstruction [ ]. see Contraindications (4 ) 5.3\tGastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Due to Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Glycopyrrolate reduces gastrointestinal motility and may result in delayed gastric emptying, constipation, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction and may precipitate or aggravate paralytic ileus and toxic megacolon [ ]. The risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions is further increased with the use of other anticholinergics and other medications that decrease gastrointestinal peristalsis. see Contraindications (4 ) Monitor patients for symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility. Concomitant use of glycopyrrolate tablets and other anticholinergics or other medications that decrease GI peristalsis is not recommended [ . see Drug Interactions (7.2 )] 5.4\tCognitive and Visual Adverse Reactions Glycopyrrolate may produce drowsiness and blurred vision and impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery, or performing other hazardous work [ ]. Concomitant use of other drugs that have anticholinergic properties may increase these effects [ see Adverse Reactions (6 ) ]. see Drug Interactions (7.1) Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or perform other hazardous tasks until they are reasonably certain that glycopyrrolate tablets does not affect them adversely. Discontinue glycopyrrolate tablets if signs or symptoms of cognitive or visual impairment develop. 5.5\tHeat Prostration at High Environmental Temperatures In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration resulting in fever and heatstroke can occur with the use of glycopyrrolate tablets due to decreased sweating, particularly in geriatric patients [ ]. Advise patients to avoid exposure to hot or very warm environmental temperatures when taking glycopyrrolate tablets. Glycopyrrolate tablets are not recommended in geriatric patients [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 ) 5.6\tOther Conditions Exacerbated by Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions Glycopyrrolate tablets are not recommended in patients with other conditions exacerbated by anticholinergic adverse reactions (e.g., autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, cardiac disease, and hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis) and in patients taking other anticholinergic medications [ ]. see Drug Interactions (7.1) 5.7\tIncreased Risk of Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Geriatric Patients Geriatric patients 65 years of age and older are at increased risk of anticholinergic adverse reactions that may lead to complications of urinary retention, bowel obstruction, heat prostration, arrhythmias, delirium, and falls or fractures. Glycopyrrolate tablets are not recommended in geriatric patients and may be contraindicated in some geriatric patients with underlying medical conditions [ ]. see Contraindications (4 ), Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.5 ), Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)",
