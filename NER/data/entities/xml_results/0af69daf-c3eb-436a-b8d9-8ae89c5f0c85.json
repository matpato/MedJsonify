( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Infection : Serious and fatal infections (e.g., pneumonia and sepsis) ( 5.2 ) Hepatotoxicity : Beleodaq may cause hepatic toxicity and liver function test abnormalities. Monitor liver function tests and omit or modify dosage for hepatic toxicities. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Tumor lysis syndrome : Monitor patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden and take appropriate precautions ( 5.4 ) Gastrointestinal Toxicity : Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea occur with Beleodaq and may require\u00a0antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications ( 5.5 ). Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Hematologic Toxicity Beleodaq can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and/or anemia; monitor blood counts weekly during treatment, and modify dosage as necessary [see Dosage and Administration ( ) and 2.2 Adverse Reactions( . 6.1 )] 5.2 Infections Serious and sometimes fatal infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, have occurred with Beleodaq. Do not administer Beleodaq to patients with an active infection. Patients with a history of extensive or intensive chemotherapy may be at higher risk of life threatening infections [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Beleodaq can cause fatal hepatotoxicity and liver function test abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions ( . Monitor liver function tests before treatment and before the start of each cycle. Interrupt or adjust dosage until recovery, or permanently discontinue Beleodaq based on the severity of the hepatic toxicity 6.1 )] [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome has occurred in Beleodaq-treated patients in the clinical trial of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL [see Clinical Studies ( ) 14 ] . Monitor patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden and take appropriate precautions [see Adverse Reactions ( ) 6.1 ] . 5.5 Gastrointestinal Toxicity Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea occur with Beleodaq [see Adverse Reactions ( and may require the use of antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications. 6.1 )] 5.6 Embryo-fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings of genotoxicity, Beleodaq can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology ( and 12.1 ) Nonclinical Toxicology ( . Advise pregnant women of the risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with Beleodaq and for 6 months after the last dose 13.1 )] [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) .

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma The safety of Beleodaq was evaluated in 129 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL in the single arm clinical trial in which patients were administered Beleodaq at a dosage of 1,000 mg/m 2 administered over 30 minutes by IV infusion once daily on Days 1 through 5 of a 21-day cycle [see Clinical Studies ( ) 14 ] . The median duration of treatment was 2 cycles (range 1 \u2013 33 cycles). The most common adverse reactions observed in the trial of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL treated with Beleodaq were nausea, fatigue, pyrexia, anemia, and vomiting [see Clinical Studies ( ) 14 ] . Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions regardless of causality from the trial in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL.

The most common serious adverse reactions (> 2%) were pneumonia, pyrexia, infection, anemia, increased creatinine, thrombocytopenia, and multi-organ failure. One treatment-related death associated with hepatic failure was reported in the trial. One patient with baseline hyperuricemia and bulky disease experienced Grade 4 tumor lysis syndrome during the first cycle of treatment and died due to multi-organ failure. A treatment-related death from ventricular fibrillation was reported in another monotherapy clinical trial with Beleodaq. ECG analysis did not identify QTc prolongation. Discontinuations due to Adverse Reactions Twenty-five patients (19.4%) discontinued treatment with Beleodaq due to adverse reactions. The adverse reactions reported most frequently as the reason for discontinuation of treatment included anemia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and multi-organ failure. Dosage Modifications due to Adverse Reactions In the trial, dosage adjustments due to adverse reactions occurred in 12% of Beleodaq-treated patients.",
