    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Monitoring : Continuously monitor patients while receiving PRECEDEX. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest : Have occurred in young healthy volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration, e.g. , rapid intravenous or bolus administration. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypotension and Bradycardia : May necessitate medical intervention. May be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension, and in the elderly. Use with caution in patients with advanced heart block or severe ventricular dysfunction. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Co-administration with Other Vasodilators or Negative Chronotropic Agents : Use with caution due to additive pharmacodynamic effects. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Transient Hypertension : Observed primarily during the loading dose. Consider reduction in loading infusion rate. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Arousability : Patients can become aroused/alert with stimulation; this alone should not be considered as lack of efficacy. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis : Prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose-related increase in adverse events. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Drug Administration PRECEDEX should be administered only by persons skilled in the management of patients in the intensive care or operating room setting. Due to the known pharmacological effects of PRECEDEX, patients should be continuously monitored while receiving PRECEDEX. 5.2 Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Sinus Arrest Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported with PRECEDEX administration in young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or with different routes of administration including rapid intravenous or bolus administration. Reports of hypotension and bradycardia have been associated with PRECEDEX infusion. Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities. If medical intervention is required, treatment may include decreasing or stopping the infusion of PRECEDEX, increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration, elevation of the lower extremities, and use of pressor agents. Because PRECEDEX has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli, clinicians should be prepared to intervene. The intravenous administration of anticholinergic agents ( e.g. , glycopyrrolate, atropine ) should be considered to modify vagal tone. In clinical trials, glycopyrrolate or atropine were effective in the treatment of most episodes of PRECEDEX-induced bradycardia. However, in some patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction, more advanced resuscitative measures were required. Caution should be exercised when administering PRECEDEX to patients with advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction. Because PRECEDEX decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be expected to be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension and in elderly patients. In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co-administered with PRECEDEX an additive pharmacodynamic effect was not observed. Nonetheless, caution should be used when such agents are administered concomitantly with PRECEDEX. 5.3 Transient Hypertension Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during the loading dose in association with the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of PRECEDEX. Treatment of the transient hypertension has generally not been necessary, although reduction of the loading infusion rate may be desirable. 5.4 Arousability Some patients receiving PRECEDEX have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated. This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms. 5.5 Withdrawal Intensive Care Unit Sedation With administration up to 7 days, regardless of dose, 12 ( 5% ) PRECEDEX adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 ( 3% ) PRECEDEX adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug. The most common events were nausea, vomiting, and agitation [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] In adult subjects, tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of <5% . Procedural Sedation In adult subjects, withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of short\u2011term infusions of PRECEDEX ( <6 hours ) . In pediatric patients, mild transient withdrawal symptoms of emergence delirium or agitation were seen after discontinuation of short\u2011term infusions of PRECEDEX ( <2 hours ) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . 5.6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis Use of dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose\u2011related increase in adverse reactions [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.7 Hyperthermia or Pyrexia PRECEDEX may induce hyperthermia or pyrexia, which may be resistant to traditional cooling methods, such as administration of cooled intravenous fluids and antipyretic medications. Discontinue PRECEDEX if drug\u2011related hyperthermia or pyrexia is suspected and monitor patients until body temperature normalizes. 5.8 Hepatic Impairment Since PRECEDEX clearance decreases with severity of hepatic impairment, dose reduction should be considered in patients with impaired hepatic function [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) ]",

( 6.1 ) \u2022 Adverse reactions in adults, associated with infusions >24 hours in duration include ARDS, respiratory failure, and agitation.

Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of adult patients in both Intensive Care Unit and procedural sedation studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth. Intensive Care Unit Sedation Adverse reaction information is derived from the continuous infusion trials of PRECEDEX for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit setting in which 1.007 adult patients received PRECEDEX. The mean total dose was 7.4 mcg/kg ( range: 0.8 to 84.1 ) , mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr ( range: 0.1 to 6.0 ) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours ( range: 0.2 to 157.2 ) . The population was between 17 to 88 years of age, 43% \u226565 years of age, 77% male and 93% Caucasian.

The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg ( range: 0.5 to 6.7 ) , mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr ( range: 0.3 to 6.1 ) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours ( range: 0.1 to 6.2 ) . The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I\u2013IV, 30% \u226565 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian. Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring in adults at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 7. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth [see . Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table.

In pediatric patients 1 month to less than 2 years old, the median total dose for the PRECEDEX low, middle, and high dose treatment groups was 8.30, 18.90, and 22.75 mcg, respectively. The median duration of treatment ranged from 52.5 to 69 minutes across treatment groups. In pediatric patients 2 to less than 17 years old, the median total dose for the PRECEDEX low, middle, and high dose treatment groups was 21.30, 43.90, and 80.25 mcg, respectively. The median duration of treatment ranged from 56.5 to 66 minutes across treatment groups. Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ] All-causality treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring in the combined age group of pediatric patients during the procedure at an incidence of >5% are provided in Table 8. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were bradypnea, bradycardia, hypertension, and hypotension [see . In the combined age group and in each age group, increased incidence in bradycardia and hypertension was observed with increasing PRECEDEX dose. Mild transient withdrawal symptoms of emergence delirium or agitation occurred in 3 of 122 patients after discontinuation of PRECEDEX infusion Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) ] [see . All reported treatment\u2011emergent adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and the majority resolved without medical intervention. No subject in the study required airway intervention, including a jaw thrust or insertion of a nasal or oral airway. A similar profile was observed in the pediatric patients 1 month to less than 2 years old and in pediatric patients 2 to less than 17 years old.
