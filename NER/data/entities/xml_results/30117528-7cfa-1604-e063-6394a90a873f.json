    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE SEVENFACT [coagulation factor VIIa (recombinant)-jncw] is indicated for the treatment and control of bleeding episodes occurring in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Limitation of Use: SEVENFACT is not indicated for the treatment of patients with congenital Factor VII deficiency. SEVENFACT [coagulation factor VIIa (recombinant)-jncw] is a coagulation factor VIIa concentrate indicated for the treatment and control of bleeding episodes occurring in adults and adolescents (12 years of age and older) with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors ( 1 ). Limitation of Use: SEVENFACT is not indicated for treatment of congenital factor VII deficiency.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS SEVENFACT is contraindicated in known allergy to rabbits or rabbit proteins. Exposure to SEVENFACT in these patients can result in severe hypersensitivity reaction. patients with severe hypersensitivity reaction to SEVENFACT or any of its components. Exposure to SEVENFACT in these patients can result in severe hypersensitivity reaction. Known allergy to rabbits or rabbit proteins. Severe hypersensitivity reaction to SEVENFACT or any of its components ( 4 ).",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors who have other risk factors for thrombosis may be at increased risk of serious arterial and venous thrombotic events ( 5.1 ). Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, are possible with SEVENFACT. Should symptoms occur, patients should discontinue SEVENFACT and seek appropriate medical intervention ( 5.2 ). 5.1       Thrombosis There is limited information about the safety of SEVENFACT in patients with a history of arterial or venous thromboembolic disease, because such patients were excluded from SEVENFACT trials. Serious arterial and venous thrombotic reactions can occur with SEVENFACT. Such reactions have been reported in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance with a similar class of products. Neither arterial nor venous thrombotic events have been reported in SEVENFACT clinical trials. The following patients may have increased risk of thromboembolic events with use of SEVENFACT: - History of congenital or acquired hemophilia receiving concomitant treatment with aPCC/PCC (activated or non-activated prothrombin complex) or other hemostatic agents - History of atherosclerotic disease, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, crush injury, septicemia, or thromboembolism. Monitor patients who receive SEVENFACT for the development of signs and symptoms of activation of the coagulation system or thrombosis. When there is laboratory confirmation of intravascular coagulation or presence of clinical thrombosis, reduce the dose of SEVENFACT or stop treatment, depending on the patient\u2019s condition. 5.2       Hypersensitivity Reactions No hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in SEVENFACT trials; however, hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur with SEVENFACT. Symptoms may include hives, itching, rash, difficulty breathing, swelling around the mouth and throat, tightness of the chest, wheezing, dizziness or fainting, and low blood pressure. In the event of hypersensitivity reactions, patients should discontinue treatment and seek immediate medical attention. Patients with known IgE-based hypersensitivity to casein may be at higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Should signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, treatment should be discontinued. Subsequent treatment with SEVENFACT should be based on a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits. 5.3       Neutralizing Antibodies In the studies performed, no patients tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, neutralizing antibodies may occur with the use of SEVENFACT. If treatment with SEVENFACT does not result in adequate hemostasis, then suspect development of neutralizing antibody as the possible cause and perform testing as clinically indicated. Neutralizing antibodies to other Factor VIIa-containing products have been observed in congenital Factor VII-deficient patients. SEVENFACT has not been studied in this patient population. [ See limitation of use statement under Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. 5.4       Laboratory Tests Laboratory coagulation parameters (PT/INR, aPTT, FVII:C) do not correlate with clinical response to SEVENFACT treatment.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22651%) reported in clinical trials for SEVENFACT were headache, dizziness, infusion-site discomfort, infusion-site hematoma, infusion-related reaction, and fever. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22651%) reported in clinical trials for SEVENFACT were headache, dizziness, infusion-site discomfort, infusion-site hematoma, infusion-related reaction and fever ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact HEMA Biologics at 855-718-HEMA (4362) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or https://www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1       Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In two studies of SEVENFACT in patients with Hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors, 42 subjects (27 subjects in Study 1 and 15 subjects in Study 2) have been exposed to SEVENFACT. Study 1: The safety of SEVENFACT has been evaluated in a safety and efficacy study of 27 subjects with Hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, which included treatment of 468 bleeding episodes. As described in Table 2, a total of seven adverse reactions were observed in two subjects (7.4%) treated with SEVENFACT. One episode of fever occurred in a 12-year-old subject, lasted two days, and was managed symptomatically. Study 2: In a study with 15 subjects evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of three escalating doses of SEVENFACT (25 mcg/kg, 75 mcg/kg and 225 mcg/kg), a total of three (20%) subjects experienced four adverse reactions (Table 2). One subject developed an infusion reaction immediately following the infusion of the first dose of 75 mcg/kg; the reaction lasted 45 minutes. Signs and symptoms included flushing, chest tightness, shakiness, transient tachycardia, and mild hypotension. Symptoms resolved without any intervention and did not recur with subsequent administration at 225 mcg/kg dose. Adverse reactions reported in the two clinical studies are shown in Table 2. Table 2       Adverse Reactions Occurring in the Two Clinical Studies Preferred Terms Number of A dverse R eactions in Study 2 ( N=15 ) Number of A dverse R eactions in Study 1 ( N=27 ) Infusion site discomfort - 4 Infusion site hematoma - 2 Dizziness 2 - Headache 1 - Body temperature increased - 1 Infusion related reaction 1 - 6.2       Immunogenicity In Study 1, two out of 27 subjects had a positive screening assay for anti-SEVENFACT antibody at baseline, prior to exposure to SEVENFACT, and at follow-up visits. One of these two subjects had a transient SEVENFACT antibody with an additional confirmatory test for anti-SEVENFACT antibody, which was confirmed as non-neutralizing. In Study 2, five of 15 subjects tested positive for anti-SEVENFACT antibody using a screening assay. The confirmatory assay was negative for all subjects at all time points. No subject developed anti-rabbit milk protein antibodies during treatment with SEVENFACT. The detection of antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to SEVENFACT with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.",
