    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS): Has occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and in allogenic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant patients receiving 8 grams per day of valacyclovir tablets in clinical trials. Discontinue treatment if clinical symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with TTP/HUS occur. ( 5.1 ) Acute renal failure: May occur in elderly patients (with or without reduced renal function), patients with underlying renal disease who receive higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function, patients who receive concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, or inadequately hydrated patients. Use with caution in elderly patients and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Central nervous system adverse reactions (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, confusion, and encephalopathy): May occur in both adult and pediatric patients (with or without reduced renal function) and in patients with underlying renal disease who receive higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function. Elderly patients are more likely to have central nervous system adverse reactions. Use with caution in elderly patients and reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment. ( 2.4 , 5.3 ) 5.1 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TTP/HUS) TTP/HUS, in some cases resulting in death, has occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and also in allogeneic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant recipients participating in clinical trials of valacyclovir tablets at doses of 8 grams per day. Treatment with valacyclovir tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities consistent with TTP/HUS occur. 5.2 Acute Renal Failure Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in: Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir tablets to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function. Dosage reduction is recommended when administering valacyclovir tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. Patients receiving other nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir tablets to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs. Patients without adequate hydration. Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility (2.5 mg/mL) is exceeded in the intratubular fluid. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients. In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Adverse Reactions (6.3) ] 5.3 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system adverse reactions, including agitation, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, seizures, and encephalopathy, have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients with or without reduced renal function and in patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function. Elderly patients are more likely to have central nervous system adverse reactions. Valacyclovir tablets should be discontinued if central nervous system adverse reactions occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.3) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6) ].",

Herpes Zoster In 2 clinical trials for the treatment of herpes zoster, the adverse reactions reported by subjects receiving valacyclovir tablets 1 gram 3 times daily for 7 to 14 days (n = 967) or placebo (n = 195), respectively, included nausea (15%, 8%), headache (14%, 12%), vomiting (6%, 3%), dizziness (3%, 2%), and abdominal pain (3%, 2%). For the incidence of laboratory abnormalities see Table 2. Table 2. Incidence (%) of Laboratory Abnormalities in Herpes Zoster and Genital Herpes Trial Populations LLN = Lower limit of normal. ULN = Upper limit of normal.

Sixty-five of these pediatric subjects, aged 12 to less than 18 years, received oral tablets for 1 to 2 days for treatment of cold sores. The remaining 112 pediatric subjects, aged 1 month to less than 12 years, participated in 3 pharmacokinetic and safety trials and received valacyclovir oral suspension. Fifty-one of these 112 pediatric subjects received oral suspension for 3 to 6 days. The frequency, intensity, and nature of clinical adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were similar to those seen in adults. Pediatric Subjects Aged 12 to Less Than 18 Years (Cold Sores) In clinical trials for the treatment of cold sores, the adverse reactions reported by adolescent subjects receiving valacyclovir tablets 2 grams twice daily for 1 day, or valacyclovir tablets 2 grams twice daily for 1 day followed by 1 gram twice daily for 1 day (n = 65, across both dosing groups), or placebo (n = 30), respectively, included headache (17%, 3%) and nausea (8%, 0%). Pediatric Subjects Aged 1 Month to Less Than 12 Years Adverse events reported in more than 1 subject across the 3 pharmacokinetic and safety trials in children aged 1 month to less than 12 years were diarrhea (5%), pyrexia (4%), dehydration (2%), herpes simplex (2%), and rhinorrhea (2%). No clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values were observed. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of valacyclovir tablets. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to valacyclovir tablets.
