Risks include altered gastrointestinal anatomy, hypomotility disorders, and concomitant medications. Advise patients to chew or crush the tablet completely. ( 5.1 ) Lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets have radio-opaque properties and, therefore, may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects Serious cases of gastrointestinal obstruction, ileus, subileus, gastrointestinal perforation, and fecal impaction have been reported in patients taking lanthanum, some requiring surgery or hospitalization. Consider discontinuing lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets in patients without another explanation for severe gastrointestinal symptoms. Risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction and gastrointestinal perforation identified from post-marketing reports in patients taking lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets include abnormal gastrointestinal anatomy (e.g., diverticular disease, peritonitis, history of gastrointestinal surgery, gastrointestinal cancer, gastrointestinal ulceration), hypomotility disorders (e.g., constipation, ileus, subileus, diabetic gastroparesis), and the use of medications known to potentiate these effects. Some cases were reported in patients with no history of gastrointestinal disease. Patients with acute peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, or bowel obstruction were not included in lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets clinical studies [see Contraindications ( . 4 )] Advise patients who are prescribed lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets to chew the tablet completely and not to swallow them whole. Serious gastrointestinal complications have been reported in association with unchewed or incompletely chewed tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] 5.2 Diagnostic Tests Lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets have radio-opaque properties and therefore may give the appearance typical of an imaging agent during abdominal X-ray procedures.

    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] In controlled trials, the most common adverse reactions that were more frequent (\u22655% difference vs. placebo) in lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets: constipation, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, and tooth injury while chewing the tablet. ( 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Teva \u00a0at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at\u00a0 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Overall, the safety profile of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets has been studied in over 5,200 subjects in completed clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions for lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets were gastrointestinal events, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and they generally abated over time with continued dosing. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies where a total of 180 and 95 patients with ESRD were randomized to lanthanum carbonate chewable tablet and placebo, respectively, for 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, the most common reactions that were more frequent (\u22655% difference) in the lanthanum carbonate chewable tablet group were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (Table 1). Table 1. Adverse Reactions* That Were More Common on Lanthanum  Carbonate Chewable Tablets in Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Studies with Treatment Periods of 4 to 6 Weeks Lanthanum Carbonate Chewable Tablets % (N=180) Placebo % (N=95) Nausea 11 5 Vomiting 9 4 Abdominal pain 5 0 *Expressed as the event rate for each term In an open-label, long-term 2-year extension study in 93 patients who had transitioned from other studies, resulting in a total of up to 6 years treatment, mean baseline values and changes in transaminases were similar to those observed in the earlier comparative studies, with little change during treatment. The safety of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets was studied in two long-term, open-label clinical trials, which included 1,215 patients treated with lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets and 944 with alternative therapy. Fourteen percent (14%) of patients treated with\u00a0lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were the most common types of event leading to discontinuation. In pooled active comparator controlled clinical trials, hypocalcemia was noted with an incidence of approximately 5% in both lanthanum and active comparator groups. A nonclinical study and a phase 1 study have shown reduced absorption of calcium in the intestine with lanthanum carbonate treatment. In a crossover study in 72 healthy individuals comparing lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets to lanthanum carbonate oral powder, gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were more common for the oral powder formulation (18%) than for the chewable tablets (7%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cases of constipation, intestinal perforation, intestinal obstruction, ileus, subileus, dyspepsia, allergic skin reactions, hypophosphatemia, and tooth injury while chewing the tablet have been reported.",
