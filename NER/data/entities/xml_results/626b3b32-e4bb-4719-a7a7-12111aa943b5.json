    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hepatic Adverse Drug Reactions: Serious hepatic reactions have been reported. Evaluate liver-related laboratory tests at the start and during the course of CRESEMBA therapy. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Infusion-related reactions were reported during intravenous administration of CRESEMBA. Discontinue the infusion if these reactions occur. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, with fatal outcome, have been reported during treatment with CRESEMBA. Serious skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with other azole antifungal agents. Discontinue CRESEMBA if anaphylactic or serious skin reactions occur, and initiate supportive treatment as needed. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: CRESEMBA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception. ( 5.4 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) \u2022 Drug Interactions: Review patient\u2019s concomitant medications. Several drugs may significantly alter isavuconazole concentrations. Isavuconazole may alter concentrations of several drugs. ( 5.5 , 7 , 12.3 ) \u2022 Drug Particulates: Intravenous formulation may form insoluble particulates following reconstitution. Administer CRESEMBA through an in-line filter. ( 2.4 , 5.6 ) 5.1 Hepatic Adverse Drug Reactions Hepatic adverse drug reactions (e.g., elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) have been reported in clinical trials. The elevations in liver-related laboratory tests were generally reversible and did not require discontinuation of CRESEMBA. Cases of more severe hepatic adverse drug reactions including hepatitis, cholestasis or hepatic failure including death have been reported in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (e.g., hematologic malignancy) during treatment with azole antifungal agents, including CRESEMBA. Evaluate liver-related laboratory tests at the start and during the course of CRESEMBA therapy. Monitor patients who develop abnormal liver-related laboratory tests during CRESEMBA therapy for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Discontinue CRESEMBA if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to CRESEMBA [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions including hypotension, dyspnea, chills, dizziness, paresthesia, and hypoesthesia were reported during intravenous administration of CRESEMBA. Discontinue the infusion if these reactions occur [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic reactions, with fatal outcome, have been reported during treatment with CRESEMBA. Symptoms including dyspnea, hypotension, generalized erythema with flushing, and urticaria have been reported in such cases often soon after the initiation of treatment. Severe Skin Reactions Severe skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported during treatment with other azole antifungal agents. Discontinue CRESEMBA if a patient develops an anaphylactic or severe cutaneous adverse reaction and initiate supportive treatment as needed. There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between CRESEMBA and other azole antifungal agents though cross-sensitivity between other triazole agents has been reported. When prescribing CRESEMBA to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles, monitor for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. 5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies, CRESEMBA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Perinatal mortality was significantly increased in the offspring of pregnant rats dosed orally with isavuconazonium sulfate at 90\u00a0mg/kg/day (less than half the maintenance human dose based on AUC comparisons) during pregnancy through the weaning period. Isavuconazonium chloride administration was associated with dose-related increases in the incidences of rudimentary cervical ribs in rats and rabbits at 30 and 45\u00a0mg/kg, respectively, doses equivalent to about 0.2 and 0.1 of the human maintenance dose based on AUC comparisons. In rats, dose-related increases in the incidences of zygomatic arch fusion and supernumerary ribs/rudimentary supernumerary ribs were also noted at 30\u00a0mg/kg and above, equivalent to one fifth the maintenance human dose based on AUC comparisons [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with CRESEMBA and for 28 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.3 )] 5.5 Drug Interactions Coadministration of CRESEMBA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or high-dose ritonavir and strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, carbamazepine, St. John\u2019s wort, or long acting barbiturates is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( . 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] 5.6 Drug Particulates Following dilution, CRESEMBA intravenous formulation may form precipitate from the insoluble isavuconazole. Administer CRESEMBA through an in-line filter [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.4 )]",

( 6.1 ) \u2022 Pediatric Patients: The most frequent adverse reactions in pediatric patients were diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, elevated liver chemistry tests, rash, nausea, pruritus, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Astellas Pharma US, Inc. at 1-800-727-7003 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of CRESEMBA cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients A total of 403\u00a0adult patients were exposed to CRESEMBA in two clinical trials. The most frequently reported adverse reactions among CRESEMBA-treated patients were nausea (26%), vomiting (25%), diarrhea (22%), headache (17%), elevated liver chemistry tests (16%), hypokalemia (14%), constipation (13%), dyspnea (12%), cough (12%), peripheral edema (11%), and back pain (10%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 223/403 (55%) of patients and 56/403 (14%) of patients permanently discontinued treatment with CRESEMBA due to an adverse reaction in the two trials. The adverse reactions which most often led to permanent discontinuation of CRESEMBA therapy during the clinical trials were confusional state (0.7%), acute renal failure (0.7%), increased blood bilirubin (0.5%), convulsion (0.5%), dyspnea (0.5%), epilepsy (0.5%), respiratory failure (0.5%), and vomiting (0.5%). Patients in the clinical trials were immunocompromised with underlying conditions including hematological malignancy, neutropenia post-chemotherapy, graft-versus-host disease, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The patient population was 61% male, had a mean age of 51\u00a0years (range 17-92, including 85\u00a0patients aged greater than 65\u00a0years), and was 79% white and 3% black. One hundred forty-four (144) patients had a duration of CRESEMBA therapy of greater than 12\u00a0weeks, with 52\u00a0patients receiving CRESEMBA for over six months. In Trial 1, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial for treatment of invasive aspergillosis, treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurred in 247/257 (96%), and 255/259 (99%) patients in the CRESEMBA and voriconazole treatment groups, respectively. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were reported in 37 (14%) CRESEMBA-treated patients and 59 (23%) voriconazole-treated patients. Table 3 includes selected adverse reactions which were reported at an incidence of \u2265 5% during CRESEMBA therapy in Trial\u00a01. In Trial 2, an open-label, non-comparative trial of CRESEMBA in patients with invasive aspergillosis and renal impairment or invasive mucormycosis, adverse reactions occurred in 139/146 (95%) of patients in the CRESEMBA treatment group. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were reported in 19 (13%) CRESEMBA-treated patients. The frequencies and types of adverse reactions observed in CRESEMBA-treated patients were similar between Trial 1 and Trial 2. Table 3.

The list does not include reactions presented in Table 3 . This listing includes adverse reactions where a causal relationship to CRESEMBA cannot be ruled out or those which may help the physician in managing the risks to the patients. \u2022 Blood and lymphatic system disorders: agranulocytosis, leukopenia, pancytopenia \u2022 Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, bradycardia, reduced QT interval on electrocardiogram, palpitations, supraventricular extrasystoles, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular extrasystoles, cardiac arrest \u2022 Ear and labyrinth disorders: tinnitus, vertigo \u2022 Eye disorders: optic neuropathy \u2022 Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal distension, gastritis, gingivitis, stomatitis \u2022 General disorders and administration site conditions: catheter thrombosis, malaise, chills \u2022 Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, hepatitis, hepatomegaly, hepatic failure \u2022 Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity \u2022 Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: fall \u2022 Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hypoalbuminemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia \u2022 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: myositis, bone pain, neck pain \u2022 Nervous system disorders: convulsion, dysgeusia, encephalopathy, hypoesthesia, migraine, peripheral neuropathy, paresthesia, somnolence, stupor, syncope, tremor \u2022 Psychiatric disorders: confusion, hallucination, depression \u2022 Renal and urinary disorders: hematuria, proteinuria \u2022 Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: bronchospasm, tachypnea \u2022 Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: alopecia, dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema, petechiae, urticaria \u2022 Vascular disorders: thrombophlebitis Laboratory Effects In Trial 1, elevated liver transaminases (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase) greater than three times the upper limit of normal were reported at the end of study treatment in 4.4% of patients who received CRESEMBA. Elevations of liver transaminases greater than ten times the upper limit of normal developed in 1.2% of patients who received CRESEMBA. Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients The clinical safety of CRESEMBA was assessed in 77 pediatric patients who received at least one dose of intravenous or oral CRESEMBA in two uncontrolled studies. Fifteen (19.5%) subjects were in the 1 to < 6 years old cohort, 30 subjects (39.0%) were in the 6 to < 12 years old cohort, and 32 subjects (41.6%) were in the 12 to < 18 years old cohort. The duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 181 days with a median duration of treatment of 15 days. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea (26%), abdominal pain (23%), vomiting (21%), elevated liver chemistry tests (18%), rash (14%), nausea (13%), pruritus (13%) and headache (12%). In general, adverse reactions (including serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of CRESEMBA) were similar to those reported in adults. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CRESEMBA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
