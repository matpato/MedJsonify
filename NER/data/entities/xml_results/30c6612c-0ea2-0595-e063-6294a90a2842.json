    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher atorvastatin calcium dosage. Discontinue atorvastatin calcium if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue atorvastatin calcium in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing atorvastatin calcium dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever ( 2.5 , 5.1 , 7.1 , 8.5 , 8.6 ). Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue atorvastatin calcium if IMNM is suspected ( 5.2 ). Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin calcium ( 5.3 ). 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Atorvastatin calcium may cause myopathy (muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK]) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statins, including atorvastatin calcium. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher atorvastatin calcium dosage [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 )]. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Atorvastatin calcium exposure may be increased by drug interactions due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and/or transporters (e.g., breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP], organic anion-transporting polypeptide [OATP1B1/OATP1B3] and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]), resulting in an increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir, or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with atorvastatin calcium is not recommended. Atorvastatin calcium dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain anti-viral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications [see Dosage and Administration ( . Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with lipid modifying doses (>1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir 2.5 )] [see Adverse Reactions ( . Consider if the benefit of use of these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis 6.1 )] [see Drug Interaction s ( . 7.1 )] Concomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking atorvastatin calcium [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Discontinue atorvastatin calcium if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if atorvastatin calcium is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue atorvastatin calcium in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the atorvastatin calcium dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persists despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue atorvastatin calcium if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of atorvastatin calcium [see Adverse Reactions ( . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. Persistent increases to more than three times the ULN in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 0.7% of patients receiving atorvastatin calcium in clinical trials. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin calcium. 6.1 )] Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Consider liver enzyme testing before atorvastatin calcium initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Atorvastatin calcium is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications ( If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue atorvastatin calcium. 4 )]. 5.4 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including atorvastatin calcium. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices. 5.5 Increased Risk of Hemorrhagic Stroke in Patients on atorvastatin calcium 80 mg with Recent Hemorrhagic Stroke In a post-hoc analysis of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial where 2,365 adult patients, without CHD who had a stroke or TIA within the preceding 6 months, were treated with atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg, a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was seen in the atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg group compared to placebo (55, 2.3% atorvastatin calcium tablets vs. 33, 1.4% placebo; HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.59; p=0.0168). The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin calcium group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin calcium group [see Adverse Reactions ( . Consider the risk/benefit of use of atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg in patients with recent hemorrhagic stroke. 6.1 )]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5%) are nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, diarrhea, pain in extremity, and urinary tract infection ( 6.1 ).

In the atorvastatin calcium placebo-controlled clinical trial database of 16,066 patients (8,755 atorvastatin calcium vs. 7,311 placebo; age range 10 to 93 years, 39% female, 91% White, 3% Black or African American, 2% Asian, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, the most common adverse reactions in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), diarrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported in \u2265 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in patients treated with atorvastatin calcium (n=8,755), from seventeen placebo-controlled trials. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u2265 2% in Patients Atorvastatin calcium -Treated with any Dose and Greater than Placebo Adverse Reaction % Placebo N=7,311 % 10 mg N=3,908 % 20 mg N=188 % 40 mg N=604 % 80 mg N=4,055 % Any dose N=8,755 Nasopharyngitis 8.2 12.9 5.3 7.0 4.2 8.3 Arthralgia 6.5 8.9 11.7 10.6 4.3 6.9 Diarrhea 6.3 7.3 6.4 14.1 5.2 6.8 Pain in extremity 5.9 8.5 3.7 9.3 3.1 6.0 Urinary tract infection 5.6 6.9 6.4 8.0 4.1 5.7 Dyspepsia 4.3 5.9 3.2 6.0 3.3 4.7 Nausea 3.5 3.7 3.7 7.1 3.8 4.0 Musculoskeletal pain 3.6 5.2 3.2 5.1 2.3 3.8 Muscle spasms 3.0 4.6 4.8 5.1 2.4 3.6 Myalgia 3.1 3.6 5.9 8.4 2.7 3.5 Insomnia 2.9 2.8 1.1 5.3 2.8 3.0 Pharyngolaryngeal pain 2.1 3.9 1.6 2.8 0.7 2.3 Other adverse reactions reported in placebo-controlled trials include: Body as a Whole : malaise, pyrexia Digestive System: abdominal discomfort, eructation, flatulence, hepatitis, cholestasis Musculoskeletal System : musculoskeletal pain, muscle fatigue, neck pain, joint swelling Metabolic and Nutritional System : transaminases increase, liver function test abnormal, blood alkaline phosphatase increase, creatine phosphokinase increase, hyperglycemia Nervous System : nightmare Respiratory System: epistaxis Skin and Appendages : urticaria Special Senses : vision blurred, tinnitus Urogenital System: white blood cells urine positive Elevations in Liver Enzyme Tests Persistent elevations in serum transaminases, defined as more than 3 times the ULN and occurring on 2 or more occasions, occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium in clinical trials. The incidence of these abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in liver enzyme tests in other patients were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent liver enzyme elevations continued treatment with a reduced dose of atorvastatin calcium. Treating to New Targets Study (TNT) In TNT , [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] 10,001 patients (age range 29 to 78 years, 19% female; 94% White, 3% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 2% other) with clinically evident CHD were treated with atorvastatin calcium tablet 10 mg daily (n=5,006) or atorvastatin calcium tablet 80 mg daily (n=4,995). In the high-dose atorvastatin group, there were more patients with serious adverse reactions (1.8%) and discontinuations due to adverse reactions (9.9%) as compared to the low-dose group (1.4%; 8.1%, respectively) during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. Persistent transaminase elevations (\u22653 x ULN twice within 4 to 10 days) occurred in 1.3% of individuals with atorvastatin calcium tablet 80 mg and in 0.2% of individuals with atorvastatin calcium tablet 10 mg. Elevations of CK (\u2265 10 x ULN) were higher in the high-dose atorvastatin group (0.3%) compared to the low-dose atorvastatin group (0.1%). Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) In SPARCL, 4,731 patients (age range 21 to 92 years, 40% female; 93% White, 3% Black or African American, 1% Asian, 3% other) without clinically evident CHD but with a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the previous 6 months were treated with atorvastatin calcium 80 mg (n=2,365) or placebo (n=2,366) for a median follow-up of 4.9 years. There was a higher incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevations (\u2265 3 x ULN twice within 4 to 10 days) in the atorvastatin group (0.9%) compared to placebo (0.1%). Elevations of CK (>10 x ULN) were rare, but were higher in the atorvastatin group (0.1%) compared to placebo (0.0%). Diabetes was reported as an adverse reaction in 6.1% of subjects in the atorvastatin group and 3.8% of subjects in the placebo group. In a post-hoc analysis, atorvastatin calcium 80 mg reduced the incidence of ischemic stroke (9.2% vs. 11.6%) and increased the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (2.3% vs. 1.4%) compared to placebo. The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar between groups (17 atorvastatin calcium vs. 18 placebo). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes was significantly greater in the atorvastatin group (38 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes) as compared to the placebo group (16 non-fatal hemorrhagic strokes). Patients who entered the trial with a hemorrhagic stroke appeared to be at increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke (16% atorvastatin calcium vs. 4% placebo). Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies of Atorvastatin calcium in Pediatric Patients with HeFH In a 26-week controlled study in pediatric patients with HeFH (ages 10 years to 17 years) (n=140, 31% female; 92% White, 1.6% Black or African American, 1.6% Asian, 4.8% other), the safety and tolerability profile of atorvastatin calcium 10 to 20 mg daily, as an adjunct to diet to reduce total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apo B levels, was generally similar to that of placebo [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6)]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atorvastatin calcium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders: pancreatitis General Disorders: fatigue Hepatobiliary Disorders: fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis Injury: tendon rupture Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : rhabdomyolysis, myositis. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use. Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, peripheral neuropathy. There have been rare reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with the use of all statins. Cognitive impairment was generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks).\u00a0There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Psychiatric Disorders: depression Respiratory Disorders: interstitial lung disease Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: angioneurotic edema, bullous rashes (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis)",
