Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.1 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 \tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, REZUROCK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of belumosudil to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo-fetal mortality and malformations at maternal exposures (AUC) less than those in patients at the recommended dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with REZUROCK and for one week after the last dose [see .

Chronic Graft versus Host Disease In two clinical trials (Study KD025-213 and Study KD025-208), 83 adult patients with chronic GVHD were treated with REZUROCK 200 mg once daily [see . The median duration of treatment was 9.2 months (range 0.5 to 44.7 months). Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Fatal adverse reaction was reported in one patient with severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and multi-organ failure. Permanent discontinuation of REZUROCK due to adverse reactions occurred in 18% of patients. The adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of REZUROCK in >3% of patients included nausea (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption occurred in 29% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to dose interruption in \u22652% were infections (11%), diarrhea (4%), and asthenia, dyspnea, hemorrhage, hypotension, liver function test abnormal, nausea, pyrexia, edema, and renal failure with (2% each). The most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were infections, asthenia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, edema, hemorrhage, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, headache, phosphate decreased, gamma glutamyl transferase increased, lymphocytes decreased, and hypertension.
