For prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum due to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis . The effectiveness of erythromycin in the prevention of ophthalmia caused by penicillinase-producing N.gonorrhoeae is not established. For infants born to mothers with clinically apparent gonorrhea, intravenous or intramuscular injections of aqueous crystalline penicillin G should be given; a single dose of 50,000 units for term infants or 20,000 units for infants of low birth weight. Topical prophylaxis alone is inadequate for these infants.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS: This drug is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to erythromycin.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "PRECAUTIONS: General: The use of antimicrobial agents may be associated with the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi; in such a case, antibiotic administration should be stopped and appropriate measures taken. Information for Patients: Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye, fingers, or other source. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Two year oral studies conducted in rats with erythromycin did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted. No evidence of impaired fertility that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in animal studies. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats, mice, and rabbits using erythromycin and its various salts and esters, at doses that were several multiples of the usual human dose. No evidence of harm to the fetus that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in these studies. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, the erythromycins should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use - See and INDICATIONS AND USAGE DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Geriatric Use: No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients.",
