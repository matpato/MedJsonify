( 4 ) Concomitant use with strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors, except ritonavir. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7.1 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery: Patients receiving alprazolam extended-release tablets should be cautioned against operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, as well as avoiding concomitant use of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs. ( 5.4 ) Patients with Depression: Exercise caution in patients with signs or symptoms of depression. Prescribe the least number of tablets feasible to avoid intentional overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome: Alprazolam extended-release tablets use during pregnancy can result in neonatal sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal. ( 5.8 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam extended-release tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe alprazolam extended-release tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of alprazolam extended-release tablets than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking alprazolam extended-release tablets, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when alprazolam extended-release tablets is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction The use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam extended-release tablets, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( . 9.2 )] Before prescribing alprazolam extended-release tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of alprazolam extended-release tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of alprazolam extended-release tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. 5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam extended-release tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.3 )] Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam extended-release tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam extended-release tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( . 9.3 )] Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( . 9.3 )] Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to alprazolam extended-release tablets. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( . Even after relatively short-term use at doses of \u2264 4 mg/day, there is some risk of dependence. Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of dependence and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg/day and for long periods (more than 12 weeks). However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients who received alprazolam, the duration of treatment (3 months compared to 6 months) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. In contrast, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than those treated with less than 4 mg/day. 9.3 )] In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss. Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal. Interdose Symptoms Early morning anxiety and emergence of anxiety symptoms between doses of alprazolam have been reported in patients with panic disorder taking prescribed maintenance doses. These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose. In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound, or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval. 5.4 Effects on Driving and\nOperating Machinery Because of its CNS depressant effects, patients receiving alprazolam extended-release tablets should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. For the same reason, patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with alprazolam extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 )] 5.5 Interaction with Drugs\nthat Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Alprazolam extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3A such as azole antifungal agents [see Contraindications ( . Ketoconazole and itraconazole have been shown 4 )] in vivo to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations 3.98 fold and 2.70 fold, respectively. Dosage adjustment is necessary when alprazolam extended-release tablets and ritonavir are initiated concomitantly or when ritonavir is added to a stable dosage of alprazolam extended-release tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Drugs demonstrated to be CYP3A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving alprazolam: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, and cimetidine [see Drug Interaction ( Use caution and consider dose reduction of alprazolam extended-release tablets, as appropriate, during co-administration with these drugs. ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 7.1 12.3 )]. 5.6 Patients with\nDepression Benzodiazepines may worsen depression. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients. Consequently, appropriate precautions (e.g., limiting the total prescription size and increased monitoring for suicidal ideation) should be considered in patients with depression. 5.7 Mania Episodes of hypomania and mania have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam extended-release tablets in patients with depression [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.8 Neonatal Sedation and\nWithdrawal Syndrome Use of alprazolam extended-release tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Monitor neonates exposed to alprazolam extended-release tablets during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to alprazolam extended-release tablets during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly. 8.1 )] 5.9 Risks in Patients with\nImpaired Respiratory Function There have been reports of death in patients with severe pulmonary disease shortly after the initiation of treatment with alprazolam. Closely monitor patients with impaired respiratory function. If signs and symptoms of respiratory depression, hypoventilation, or apnea occur, discontinue alprazolam extended-release tablets.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Patients with Depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Risks in Patients with Impaired Respiratory Function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] The most common adverse reactions in panic disorder patients treated with alprazolam extended-release tablets (incidence of \u22655% and at least twice that of placebo) include: somnolence, memory impairment, dysarthria, coordination abnormal, ataxia, libido decreased, constipation, and nausea.

The information included in the section on Adverse Reactions Observed in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials with alprazolam extended-release tablets is based on pooled data of five 6- and 8-week placebo-controlled clinical studies in panic disorder. Adverse Reactions Observed in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Alprazolam Extended-Release Tablets Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment in Placebo-Controlled Trials Approximately 17% of the 531 patients who received alprazolam extended-release tablets in placebo-controlled clinical trials for panic disorder had at least 1 adverse event that led to discontinuation compared to 8% of 349 placebo-treated patients. The most common events leading to discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of the patients treated with alprazolam extended-release tablets at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in \u22651% of Alprazolam Extended-Release Tablets-treated Patients and at least twice the Rate of Placebo-treated Patients in Placebo-Controlled Trials Percentage of Patients Discontinuing Due to Adverse Reactions Alprazolam Extended-Release Tablets (n=531) Placebo (n=349) Nervous system disorders Sedation 7.5 0.6 Somnolence 3.2 0.3 Dysarthria 2.1 0 Coordination abnormal 1.9 0.3 Memory impairment 1.5 0.3 General disorders/administration site conditions Fatigue 1.7 0.6 Psychiatric disorders Depression 2.5 1.2 n=number of patients Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Patients Treated with Alprazolam Extended-Release Tablets Table 2 shows the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred during 6- and 8-week placebo-controlled trials in 1% or more of patients treated with alprazolam extended-release tablets where the incidence in patients treated with alprazolam extended-release tablets was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in panic disorder patients treated with alprazolam extended-release tablets (incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice\u00a0the incidence in placebo patients) were: sedation, somnolence, memory impairment, dysarthria, coordination abnormal, ataxia, libido decreased.

Adverse reactions are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: those occurring in at least l/l00 patients (frequent); those occurring in less than l/100 patients but at least l/1,000 patients (infrequent); those occurring in fewer than l/1,000 patients (rare). Cardiac disorders: Frequent: palpitation; Infrequent: sinus tachycardia Ear and Labyrinth disorders: Frequent: Vertigo; Infrequent : tinnitus, ear pain Eye disorders: Frequent: blurred vision; Infrequent: mydriasis, photophobia : Gastrointestinal disorders Frequent: diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain; Infrequent : dysphagia, salivary hypersecretion : General disorders and administration site conditions Frequent : malaise, weakness, chest pains; Infrequent: fall, pyrexia, thirst, feeling hot and cold, edema, feeling jittery, sluggishness, asthenia, feeling drunk, chest tightness, increased energy, feeling of relaxation, hangover, loss of control of legs, rigors : Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Frequent : back pain, muscle cramps, muscle twitching : Nervous system disorders Frequent: headache, dizziness, tremor; Infrequen t: amnesia, clumsiness, syncope, hypotonia, seizures, depressed level of consciousness, sleep apnea syndrome, sleep talking, stupor : Psychiatric system disorders Frequent : irritability, insomnia, nervousness, derealization, libido increased, restlessness, agitation, depersonalization, nightmare; Infrequent: abnormal dreams, apathy, aggression, anger, bradyphrenia, euphoric mood, logorrhea, mood swings, dysphonia, hallucination, homicidal ideation, mania, hypomania, impulse control, psychomotor retardation, suicidal ideation : Renal and urinary disorders Frequent : difficulty in micturition; Infrequent : urinary frequency, urinary incontinence Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders : Frequent : nasal congestion, hyperventilation; Infrequent: choking sensation, epistaxis, rhinorrhea : Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Frequent: sweating increased; Infrequent: clamminess, rash, urticaria : Vascular disorders Infrequent: hypotension Discontinuation-Emergent Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 5% or More Among Patients Treated with Alprazolam Extended-Release Tablets Table 3 shows the incidence of discontinuation-emergent adverse reactions that occurred during short-term, placebo-controlled trials in 5% or more of patients treated with alprazolam extended-release tablets where the incidence in patients treated with alprazolam extended-release tablets was 2 times greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. Table 3: Discontinuation-Emergent Symptom Incidence Reported in \u22655% of Alprazolam Extended-Release Tablets-treated Patients and at least twice the Rate of Placebo-treated Patients in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Alprazolam Extended-Release Tablets n=422 (%) Placebo n=261 (%) Nervous system disorders Tremor 28.2 10.7 Headache 26.5 12.6 Hypoesthesia 7.8 2.3 Paresthesia 7.1 2.7 Psychiatric disorders Insomnia 24.2 9.6 Nervousness 21.8 8.8 Depression 10.9 5.0 Derealization 8.0 3.8 Anxiety 7.8 2.7 Depersonalization 5.7 1.9 Gastrointestinal disorders Diarrhea 12.1 3.1 Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Hyperventilation 8.5 2.7 Metabolism and nutrition disorders Appetite decreased 9.5 3.8 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Muscle twitching 7.4 2.7 Vascular disorders Hot flushes 5.9 2.7 There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 )]. Paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation, rage, irritability, and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects, patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur, alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder, a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability, hostility, and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. 6.2 Postmarketing\nExperience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of alprazolam tablets and/or alprazolam extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Endocrine disorders: Hyperprolactinemia General disorders and administration site conditions: Edema peripheral Hepatobiliary disorders: Hepatitis, hepatic failure, jaundice Investigations: Liver enzyme elevations Psychiatric disorders: Hypomania, mania Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, galactorrhea, menstruation irregular Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome",
