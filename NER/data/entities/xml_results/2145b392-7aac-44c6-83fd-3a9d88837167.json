    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of parenteral phytonadione were identified in clinical studies or post-marketing reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactoid reactions and deaths, have been reported following parenteral administration. The majority of these reported events occurred following intravenous administration. Transient \u201cflushing sensations\u201d and \u201cpeculiar\u201d sensations of taste have been observed with parenteral phytonadione, as well as instances of dizziness, rapid and weak pulse, profuse sweating, brief hypotension, dyspnea, and cyanosis. Hyperbilirubinemia has been observed in the newborn following administration of parenteral phytonadione. This has occurred primarily with doses above those recommended. Most common adverse reactions are transient \u201cflushing sensations\u201d, \u201cpeculiar\u201d sensations of taste and instances of dizziness, rapid and weak pulse, profuse sweating, brief hypotension, dyspnea, and cyanosis.
