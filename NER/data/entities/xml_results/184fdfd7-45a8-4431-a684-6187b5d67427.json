    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) indicated for: Treatment of acute, uncomplicated influenza A and B in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. (1.1) Prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older. (1.2) Limitations of Use : Not a substitute for annual influenza vaccination. (1.3) Consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use. (1.3) Not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis. (1.3) 1.1 Treatment of Influenza Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are indicated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated illness due to influenza A and B infection in patients 2 weeks of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. 1.2\nProphylaxis of Influenza Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza A and B in patients 1 year and older. 1.3 Limitations of Use Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance substitutions could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use oseltamivir phosphate capsules [see . Microbiology (12.4) ] Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease not undergoing dialysis [see and Dosage and Administration (2.4) . Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Oseltamivir phosphate capsules are contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir or any component of the product. Severe allergic reactions have included anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir or any of the components of oseltamivir phosphate capsules. (4)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme: Discontinue oseltamivir phosphate and initiate appropriate treatment if allergic-like reactions occur or are suspected. (5.1) Neuropsychiatric events: Patients with influenza, including those receiving oseltamivir phosphate, particularly pediatric patients, may be at an increased risk of confusion or abnormal behavior early in their illness. Monitor for signs of abnormal behavior. (5.2) 5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in post-marketing experience with oseltamivir phosphate. Stop oseltamivir phosphate and institute appropriate treatment if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. The use of oseltamivir phosphate is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir phosphate [see and Contraindications (4) . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Events There have been post-marketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir phosphate [see . Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir phosphate usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of oseltamivir phosphate to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. Closely monitor oseltamivir phosphate-treated patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing oseltamivir phosphate for each patient. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.3 Risk of Bacterial Infections There is no evidence for efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Oseltamivir phosphate has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Neuropsychiatric events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Most common adverse reactions (> 1% and more common than with placebo): Treatment studies \u2013 Nausea, vomiting, headache. (6.1) Prophylaxis studies \u2013 Nausea, vomiting, headache, pain. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older) The overall safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate is based on data from 2,646 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days for treatment of influenza and 1,943 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally once daily for up to 6 weeks for prophylaxis of influenza in clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions in the pooled treatment and pooled prophylaxis trials in adults and adolescents are displayed in Table 5. The majority of these adverse reactions were reported on a single occasion, occurred on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within 1 to 2 days. This summary includes otherwise healthy adults/adolescents and subjects \u201cat risk\u201d (subjects at higher risk of developing complications associated with influenza, e.g., elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, the safety profile in the subjects \u201cat risk\u201d was qualitatively similar to that in otherwise healthy adults/adolescents. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u2265 1% of Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older) in Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials* System Organ Class Adverse Reaction Treatment Trials Prophylaxis Trials Oseltamivir Phosphate 75 mg twice daily (n = 2,646) Placebo (n = 1,977) Oseltamivir Phosphate 75 mg once daily (n = 1,943) Placebo (n = 1,586) Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea Vomiting 10% 8% 6% 3% 8% 2% 4% 1% Nervous System Disorders Headache General Disorders Pain 2% < 1% 1% < 1% 17% 4% 16% 3% * Adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 1% of oseltamivir phosphate-treated adults and adolescents and \u2265 1% greater in oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects in either the treatment or prophylaxis trials. Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age) A total of 1,481 pediatric subjects (including otherwise healthy pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years and asthmatic pediatric subjects aged 6 to 12 years) participated in clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza. A total of 859 pediatric subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension either at a 2 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days or weight-band dosing. Vomiting was the only adverse reaction reported at a frequency of \u2265 1% in subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate (16%) compared to placebo (8%). Amongst the 148 pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years who received oseltamivir phosphate at doses of 30 to 60 mg once daily for 10 days in a post-exposure prophylaxis study in household contacts (n = 99), and in a separate 6\u2013week seasonal influenza prophylaxis safety study (n = 49), vomiting was the most frequent adverse reaction (8% on oseltamivir phosphate versus 2% in the no prophylaxis group). Adverse Reactions from Treatment Trials in Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age) Assessment of adverse reactions in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age was based on two open-label studies that included safety data on 135 influenza-infected subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age) exposed to oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg of the formulation for oral suspension twice daily orally for 5 days. The safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate was similar across the age range studied, with vomiting (9%), diarrhea (7%) and diaper rash (7%) being the most frequently reported adverse reactions, and was generally comparable to that observed in older pediatric and adult subjects. Adverse Reactions from the Prophylaxis Trial in Immunocompromised Subjects In a 12-week seasonal prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised subjects, including 18 pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age, the safety profile in the 238 subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily was consistent with that previously observed in other oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis clinical trials [see . Clinical Studies (14.2) ] 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oseltamivir phosphate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to oseltamivir phosphate exposure. General disorders and administration site conditions: Swelling of the face or tongue, allergy, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, hypothermia. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash, dermatitis, urticaria, eczema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme [ see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) Gastrointestinal Disorders: Gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic colitis. Cardiac Disorders: Arrhythmia. Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests. Nervous System Disorders: Seizure. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Aggravation of diabetes. Psychiatric Disorders: Abnormal behavior, delirium, including symptoms such as hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, altered level of consciousness, confusion, nightmares, delusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].",
