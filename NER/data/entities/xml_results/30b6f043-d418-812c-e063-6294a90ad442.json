    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Doxazosin tablets are an alpha1 adrenergic antagonist indicated for: Signs and symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Treatment of Hypertension 1.1 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) Doxazosin tablets are indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of BPH. 1.2 Hypertension Doxazosin tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including this drug. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Doxazosin tablets are may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensives.",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of doxazosin tablets is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to doxazosin, other quinazolines (e.g., prazosin, terazosin), or any of its components. Hypersensitivity to doxazosin, other quinazolines, or any other ingredient in doxazosin tablets. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Postural hypotension with or without syncope may occur. ( 5.1 ) Risk of Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome during cataract surgery. ( 5.2 ) Screen for the presence of prostate cancer prior to treatment for BPH and at regular intervals afterwards. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Postural Hypotension Postural hypotension with or without symptoms (e.g., dizziness) may develop within a few hours following administration of doxazosin. However, infrequently, symptomatic postural hypotension has also been reported later than a few hours after dosing. As with other alpha-blockers, there is a potential for syncope, especially after the initial dose or after an increase in dosage strength. Advise patient how to avoid symptoms resulting from postural hypotension and what measures to take should they develop. Concomitant administration of doxazosin with a PDE-5 inhibitor can result in additive blood pressure lowering effects and symptomatic hypotension. 5.2 Cataract Surgery Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) has been observed during cataract surgery in some patients on or previously treated with alpha 1 blockers. This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in response to intraoperative irrigation currents, progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative dilation with standard mydriatic drugs, and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. The patient's surgeon should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique, such as the utilization of iris hooks, iris dilator rings, or viscoelastic substances. There does not appear to be a benefit of stopping alpha 1 blocker therapy prior to cataract surgery. 5.3 Prostate Cancer Carcinoma of the prostate causes many of the symptoms associated with BPH and the two disorders frequently co-exist. Carcinoma of the prostate should therefore be ruled out prior to commencing therapy with doxazosin for the treatment of BPH. 5.4 Priapism Alpha 1 antagonists, including doxazosin, have been associated with priapism (painful penile erection, sustained for hours and unrelieved by sexual intercourse or masturbation). This condition can lead to permanent impotence if not promptly treated.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions from clinical trials are Fatigue, malaise, hypotension, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) The incidence of adverse events has been ascertained from worldwide clinical trials in 965 BPH patients. The incidence rates presented below (Table 2) are based on combined data from seven placebo-controlled trials involving once-daily administration of doxazosin in doses of 1 to 16 mg in hypertensives and 0.5 to 8 mg in normotensives. Adverse reactions occurring more than 1% more frequently in BPH patients treated with doxazosin vs. placebo are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Adverse Reactions Occurring more than 1% More Frequently in BPH Patients Treated with Doxazosin Versus Placebo \u2020 I n c l u d e s v e r t i g o Doxazosin Placebo BODY SYSTEM N = 665 N = 300 NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Dizziness \u2020 15.6% 9% Somnolence 3% 1% CARDIAC DISORDERS Hypotension 1.7% 0% RESPIRATORY , THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL DISORDERS Dyspnoea 2.6% 0.3% GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS Dry\u00a0Mouth 1.4% 0.3% GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS Fatigue 8% 1.7% Oedema 2.7% 0.7% Other adverse reactions occurring less than 1% more frequently in BPH patients treated with doxazosin vs. placebo but plausibly related to doxazosin include: palpitations. Hypertension Doxazosin has been administered to approximately 4000 hypertensive patients in clinical trials, of whom 1679 were included in the hypertension clinical development program. In placebo-controlled studies, adverse events occurred in 49% and 40% of patients in the doxazosin and placebo groups, respectively, and led to discontinuation in 2% of patients in each group. Adverse reactions occurring more than 1% more frequently in hypertensive patients treated with doxazosin vs. placebo are summarized in Table 1. . Postural effects and edema appeared to be dose-related. The prevalence rates presented below are based on combined data from placebo-controlled studies involving once-daily administration of doxazosin at doses ranging from 1 to 16 mg. Table 2Adverse Reactions Occurring more than 1% More Frequently inHypertensive Patients Treated with Doxazosin versus Placebo Doxazosin Placebo BODY SYSTEM N = 339 N = 336 NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS Dizziness 19% 9% Somnolence 5% 1% RESPIRATORY , THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL DISORDERS Rhinitis 3% 1% RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS Polyuria 2% 0% REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND BREAST DISORDERS GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION SITE CONDITIONS Fatigue/Malaise 12% 6% Other adverse reactions occurring less than 1% more frequently in hypertensive patients treated with doxazosin vs. placebo but plausibly related to doxazosin use include vertigo, hypotension, hot flushes, epistaxis and oedema. Doxazosin has been associated with decreases in white blood cell counts. Laboratory changes observed in clinical studies Leukopenia/Neutropenia: Decreases in mean white blood cell (WBC) and mean neutrophil count were observed in controlled clinical trials of hypertensive patients receiving doxazosin. In cases where follow-up was available, WBC and neutrophil counts returned to normal after discontinuation of doxazosin. No patients became symptomatic as a result of the low WBC or neutrophil counts. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of doxazosin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. In post-marketing experience, the following additional adverse reactions have been reported: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; Immune System Disorders: allergic reaction; Nervous System Disorders: hypoesthesia; Eye Disorders: Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome [see Warnings and precautions (5.4)] ; Cardiac Disorders: bradycardia; Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: bronchospasm aggravated; Gastrointestinal Disorders: vomiting; Hepatobiliary Disorders: cholestasis, hepatitis cholestatic; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: urticaria; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: muscle cramps, muscle weakness; Renal and Urinary Disorders: hematuria, micturition disorder, micturition frequency, nocturia; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: gynecomastia, priapism.",
