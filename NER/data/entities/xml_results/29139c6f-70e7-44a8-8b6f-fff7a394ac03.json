    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hyper- or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen: Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia: May be life-threatening. Factors which may increase the risk include changes in nutrition and co-administered medication and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended in patients at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur. Discontinue MYXREDLIN, monitor, and treat if indicated. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening. Monitor potassium levels and treat if indicated. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin strength, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] or hyperglycemia. These changes should be made cautiously and under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased. 5.2 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including MYXREDLIN. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death. Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time. Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual. Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system ( e.g. , beta-blockers ) [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia. Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia Factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in nutrition and co-administered medication [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6, 8.7 ) ] . Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize hypoglycemia. In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended. 5.3 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with MYXREDLIN. Generalized allergy to insulin may manifest as a whole body rash ( including pruritus ) , dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue MYXREDLIN; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve. MYXREDLIN is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin human or any of the excipients in MYXREDLIN [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . 5.4 Hypokalemia All insulins, including MYXREDLIN, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. Monitor potassium levels and treat if indicated. 5.5 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) -gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with insulin, including MYXREDLIN, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 Hypokalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Adverse Reactions from Clinical Studies or Postmarketing Reports The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during clinical studies or from postmarketing reports with use of insulin human injection. Because some of these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions associated with insulin initiation and glucose control intensification Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy, and acute painful peripheral neuropathy. Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Hypersensitivity reactions Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction with MYXREDLIN. Hypokalemia MYXREDLIN can cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia. Peripheral edema Insulins, including MYXREDLIN, may cause sodium retention and edema, particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapies, including MYXREDLIN, and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic peptides, insulin administration may cause anti-insulin antibodies to form. Increases in titers of anti-insulin antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed in patients treated with subcutaneous insulin human injection. Adverse reactions observed with insulin human injection include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, weight gain and edema ( 6 ) .
