( 5.1 ) \u2022 Precipitation with Ceftriaxone: do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with CLINIMIX E via a Y-site. ( 4 , 5.2 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue infusion if reactions occur. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Risk of Infections, Refeeding Complications, and Hyperglycemia or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State: monitor for signs and symptoms; monitor laboratory parameters. ( 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Vein Damage and Thrombosis: solutions with osmolarity of \u2265 900 mOsm/L must be infused through a central catheter. ( 2.2 , 5.7 ) \u2022 Hepatobiliary Disorders: monitor liver function parameters and ammonia levels. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Aluminum Toxicity: increased risk in patients with impaired kidney function, including  preterm infants. ( 5.9 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease: increased risk in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time, especially preterm infants; monitor liver function tests, if abnormalities occur consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. ( 5.10 , 8.4 ) \u2022 Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload: patients with cardiac insufficiency or kidney disease may require adjustment of fluid, protein and electrolyte content. ( 5.11 , 8.4 ) 5.1 Pulmonary Embolism due to Pulmonary Vascular Precipitates Pulmonary vascular precipitates causing pulmonary vascular emboli and pulmonary distress have been reported in patients receiving parenteral nutrition.  In some cases, fatal outcomes due to pulmonary embolism have occurred.  Patients, especially those with hypophosphatemia, may require the addition of phosphate. To prevent hypocalcemia, calcium supplementation should always accompany phosphate administration. Excessive addition of calcium and phosphate increases the risk of the formation of calcium phosphate precipitates.  Precipitates have been reported even in the absence of phosphate salt in the solution.  Precipitation following passage through an in-line filter and suspected in vivo precipitate formation has also been reported.  If signs of pulmonary distress occur, stop the infusion and initiate a medical evaluation.  In addition to inspection of the solution [see , the infusion set and catheter should also periodically be checked for precipitates. Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 )] 5.2 Precipitation with Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone-calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium-containing parenteral nutrition solutions, such as CLINIMIX E, in the same intravenous administration line. Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with CLINIMIX E via a Y-site. Deaths have occurred in neonates (less than 28 days of age) who received concomitant intravenous calcium-containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys, even when separate infusion lines were used. CLINIMIX E is contraindicated in neonates receiving ceftriaxone [see Contraindications (4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. In patients older than 28 days (including adults), ceftriaxone and CLINIMIX E may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid . 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported with CLINIMIX E.  Stop infusion immediately and treat patient accordingly if any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction develop. Signs or symptoms may include: hypotension, hypertension, peripheral cyanosis, tachycardia, dyspnea, vomiting, nausea, urticaria, rash, pruritus, erythema, hyperhidrosis, pyrexia, and chills. 5.4 Risk of Infections Patients who require parenteral nutrition are at high risk of infections because the nutritional components of these solutions can support microbial growth. Infection and sepsis may also occur as a result of the use of intravenous catheters to administer parenteral nutrition. The risk of infection is increased in patients with malnutrition-associated immunosuppression, hyperglycemia exacerbated by dextrose infusion, long-term use and poor maintenance of intravenous catheters, or immunosuppressive effects of other concomitant conditions, drugs, or other components of the parenteral formulation (e.g., lipid emulsion). To decrease the risk of infection, ensure aseptic technique in catheter placement and maintenance, as well as aseptic technique in the preparation and administration of the nutritional formula. Monitor for signs and symptoms (including fever and chills) of early infections, including laboratory test results (including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia) and frequent checks of the parenteral access device and insertion site for edema, redness and discharge. 5.5 Refeeding Syndrome Refeeding severely undernourished patients may result in refeeding syndrome, characterized by the intracellular shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium as the patient becomes anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase nutrient intakes. 5.6 Hyperglycemia or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State When using CLINIMIX E in patients with diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia. Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient\u2019s utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia, coma, and death. Patients with dehydration, resulting in a transient reduction in glomerular filtration rate and pre-renal azotemia, may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.  Monitor blood glucose levels and treat hyperglycemia to maintain optimum levels while administering CLINIMIX E. Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose levels during CLINIMIX E administration. 5.7 Vein Damage and Thrombosis Solutions with osmolarity of 900 mOsm/L or greater must be infused through a central catheter.  CLINIMIX E solutions containing more than 5% dextrose have an osmolarity greater than or equal to 900 mOsm/L. CLINIMIX E 4.25/10, 5/15, 5/20, 8/10 and 8/14 are indicated for administration into a central vein only, such as the superior vena cava [see . The infusion of hypertonic nutrient injections into a peripheral vein may result in vein irritation, vein damage, and/or thrombosis. Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] CLINIMIX E 2.75/5 and 4.25/5 are indicated for peripheral administration, or may be infused into a central vein [see . The primary complication of peripheral access is venous thrombophlebitis, which manifests as pain, erythema, tenderness or a palpable cord. Remove the catheter as soon as possible, if thrombophlebitis develops. Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.8 Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders are known to develop in some patients without preexisting liver disease who receive parenteral nutrition, including cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholestasis, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, possibly leading to hepatic failure. The etiology of these disorders is thought to be multifactorial and may differ between patients. Increase in blood ammonia levels and hyperammonemia may occur in patients receiving amino acid solutions. In some patients this may indicate hepatic insufficiency or the presence of an inborn error of amino acid metabolism [see . Contraindications (4) ] Monitor liver function parameters and ammonia levels. Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in liver diseases in order to identify possible causative and contributory factors, and possible therapeutic and prophylactic interventions. 5.9 Aluminum Toxicity CLINIMIX E contains no more than 25 mcg/L of aluminum.  The aluminum contained in CLINIMIX E may reach toxic levels with prolonged administration in patients with impaired kidney function. Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.  Patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity.  Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. 5.10 Risk of Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease (PNALD) has been reported in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time, especially preterm infants, and can present as cholestasis or steatohepatitis. The exact etiology is unknown and is likely multifactorial. If CLINIMIX E treated patients develop liver test abnormalities consider discontinuation or dosage reduction. 5.11 Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload Patients with abnormal renal function due to pre-renal azotemia, renal obstruction, or intrinsic kidney disease may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance. Patients with cardiac insufficiency due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction are susceptible to excess fluid accumulation. Use CLINIMIX E with caution in patients with cardiac insufficiency or kidney disease. CLINIMIX E dosage may require adjustment with specific attention to fluid, protein, and electrolyte content in these patients. Monitor renal function parameters. Patients developing signs of kidney disease should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in kidney disease in order to determine the appropriate CLINIMIX E dosage and other treatment options. 5.12 Monitoring/Laboratory Tests Monitor fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count and coagulation parameters throughout treatment. In situations of severely elevated electrolyte levels, stop CLINIMIX E until levels have been corrected.",
