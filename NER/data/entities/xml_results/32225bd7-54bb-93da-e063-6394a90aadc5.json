    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression may occur, with the potential for glucocorticosteroid\u00a0insufficiency during or after treatment. Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression. (5.1) Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also include Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Use of potent corticosteroids on large areas, for prolonged durations, under occlusive dressings, or on an altered skin barrier may increase systemic exposure. (5.1) Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids. (5.1, 8.4) Local adverse reactions with topical steroids may include atrophy, striae, irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis. Adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. (5.2, 5.5) Topical corticosteroids may increase the risk of cataract and glaucoma formation. If visual symptoms occur, consider referral to an ophthalmologist tor evaluation. (5.3) Initiate appropriate therapy if concomitant skin infections develop. (5.4) 5.1 Effects on Endocrine System ULTRAVATE lotion has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may include reversible HPA axis suppression, with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of treatment of the topical corticosteroid.The potential for hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) suppression with ULTRAVATE lotion was evaluated in the following studies: In a study of 20 adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis involving \udbc0\udcd920% of their body surtace area. ULTRAVATE lotion produced HPA axis suppression when used twice daily for two weeks in 5 out of 20 (25%) adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. The effects of HPA axis suppression were reversible on discontinuation of the treatment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . In another clinical study, 16 adolescent subjects (12 to less than 17 years old) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis involving 10% or more of their body surtace area applied a maximum of approximately 50 grams of ULTRAVATE lotion to affected areas twice daily for two weeks. Of the 14 subjects evaluated for HPA axis suppression, adrenal suppression occurred in 1 subject (7%) which recovered upon retest [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids, including ULTRAVATE lotion, may require that patients be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surtace areas, prolonged use, occlusive use, use on an altered skin barrier, concomitant use of multiple corticosteroid-containing products, liver failure, and young age. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression.If HPA axis suppression is documented, attempt to gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also include Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic exposure to topical corticosteroids. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from the use of topical corticosteroids due to their larger surtace-to-body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions from topical corticosteroids may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. These may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids, including ULTRAVATE lotion. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Concomitant Skin Infections Use an appropriate antimicrobial agent if a skin infection is present or develops. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, discontinue use of ULTRAVATE lotion until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.5 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation. Consider confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis by appropriate patch testing. Discontinue ULTRAVATE lotion if allergic contact dermatitis is established.",
