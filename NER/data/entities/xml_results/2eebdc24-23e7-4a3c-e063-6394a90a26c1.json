( 4.1 ) Coadministration of posaconazole delayed-release tablets with the following drugs is contraindicated; posaconazole delayed-release tablets increase concentrations and toxicities of: Sirolimus ( 4.2 , 5.1 , 7.1 ) CYP3A4 substrates (pimozide, quinidine): can result in QTc interval prolongation and cases of torsades de pointes (TdP) ( 4.3 , 5.2 , 7.2 ) HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Primarily Metabolized through CYP3A4 ( 4.4 , 7.3 ) Ergot alkaloids ( 4.5 , 7.4 ) Venetoclax: In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) at initiation and during the ramp-up phase ( 4.6 , 5.11 , 7.16 ) 4.1 Hypersensitivity Posaconazole delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in persons with known hypersensitivity to posaconazole or other azole antifungal agents. 4.2 Use with Sirolimus Posaconazole delayed-release tablets are contraindicated with sirolimus. Concomitant administration of posaconazole delayed-release tablets with sirolimus increases the sirolimus blood concentrations by approximately 9-fold and can result in sirolimus toxicity [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 4.3 QT Prolongation with Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Substrates Posaconazole delayed-release tablets are contraindicated with CYP3A4 substrates that prolong the QT interval. Concomitant administration of posaconazole delayed-release tablets with the CYP3A4 substrates, pimozide and quinidine may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs, leading to QTc prolongation and cases of torsades de pointes [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 4.4 HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Primarily Metabolized Through CYP3A4 Coadministration with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are primarily metabolized through CYP3A4 (e.g., atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) is contraindicated since increased plasma concentration of these drugs can lead to rhabdomyolysis [see .

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Calcineurin-Inhibitor Toxicity: Posaconazole delayed-release tablets increase concentrations of cyclosporine or tacrolimus; reduce dose of cyclosporine and tacrolimus and monitor concentrations frequently. ( 5.1 ) Arrhythmias and QTc Prolongation: Posaconazole delayed-release tablets have been shown to prolong the QTc interval and cause cases of TdP. Administer with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions. Do not administer with drugs known to prolong QTc interval and metabolized through CYP3A4. ( 5.2 ) Electrolyte Disturbances: Monitor and correct, especially those involving potassium (K + ), magnesium (Mg ++ ), and calcium (Ca ++ ), before and during posaconazole delayed-release tablets therapy. ( 5.3 ) Pseudoaldosteronism: Manifested by the onset or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels, and manage as necessary. ( 5.4 ) Hepatic Toxicity: Elevations in liver tests may occur. Discontinuation should be considered in patients who develop abnormal liver tests\u00a0or monitor liver tests\u00a0during treatment. ( 5.5 ) Concomitant Use with\u00a0Midazolam: Posaconazole delayed-release tablets can prolong hypnotic/sedative effects. Monitor patients and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists should be available. ( 5.7 , 7.5 ) Vincristine Toxicity: Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole delayed-release tablets, with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions; reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole delayed-release tablets, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options. ( 5.8 , 7.10 ) Breakthrough Fungal Infections: Monitor patients with severe diarrhea or vomiting when receiving posaconazole delayed-release tablets. ( 5.10 ) Venetoclax Toxicity: Concomitant administration of posaconazole delayed-release tablets with venetoclax may increase venetoclax toxicities, including the risk of tumor lysis syndrome, neutropenia, and serious infections; monitor for toxicity and reduce venetoclax dose. ( 4.6 , 5.11 , 7.16 ) 5.1 Calcineurin-Inhibitor Toxicity Concomitant administration of posaconazole delayed-release tablets with cyclosporine or tacrolimus increases the whole blood trough concentrations of these calcineurin-inhibitors [see . Nephrotoxicity and leukoencephalopathy (including deaths) have been reported in clinical efficacy studies in patients with elevated cyclosporine or tacrolimus concentrations. Frequent monitoring of tacrolimus or cyclosporine whole blood trough concentrations should be performed during and at discontinuation of posaconazole treatment and the tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose adjusted accordingly. Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.2 Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation Some azoles, including posaconazole, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. In addition, cases of torsades de pointes have been reported in patients taking posaconazole. Results from a multiple time-matched ECG analysis in healthy volunteers did not show any increase in the mean of the QTc interval. Multiple, time-matched ECGs collected over a 12-hour period were recorded at baseline and steady-state from 173 healthy male and female volunteers (18-85 years of age) administered Noxafil \u00ae Oral Suspension\u00a0400 mg twice daily with a high-fat meal. In this pooled analysis, the mean QTc (Fridericia) interval change from baseline was \u20135 msec following administration of the recommended clinical dose. A decrease in the QTc(F) interval (\u20133 msec) was also observed in a small number of subjects (n=16) administered placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean maximum QTc(F) interval change from baseline was <0 msec (\u20138 msec). No healthy subject administered posaconazole had a QTc(F) interval \u2265500 msec or an increase \u226560 msec in their QTc(F) interval from baseline. Posaconazole should be administered with caution to patients with potentially proarrhythmic conditions. Do not administer with drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval and are metabolized through CYP3A4 [see . Contraindications (4.3) and Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 5.3 Electrolyte Disturbances Electrolyte disturbances, especially those involving potassium, magnesium or calcium levels, should be monitored and corrected as necessary before and during posaconazole therapy. 5.4\u00a0Pseudoaldosteronism Pseudoaldosteronism, manifested by the onset of hypertension or worsening of hypertension, and abnormal laboratory findings (hypokalemia, low serum renin and aldosterone, and elevated 11-deoxycortisol), has been reported with posaconazole use in the postmarket setting. Monitor blood pressure and potassium levels and manage as necessary. Management of pseudoaldosteronism may include discontinuation of posaconazole delayed-release tablets, substitution with an appropriate antifungal drug that is not associated with pseudoaldosteronism, or use of aldosterone receptor antagonists. 5.5 Hepatic Toxicity Hepatic reactions (e.g., mild to moderate elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and/or clinical hepatitis) have been reported in clinical trials. The elevations in liver tests were generally reversible on discontinuation of therapy, and in some instances these tests normalized without drug interruption. Cases of more severe hepatic reactions including cholestasis or hepatic failure including deaths have been reported in patients with serious underlying medical conditions (e.g., hematologic malignancy) during treatment with posaconazole. These severe hepatic reactions were seen primarily in subjects receiving the Noxafil \u00ae Oral Suspension 800 mg daily (400 mg twice daily or 200 mg four times a day) in clinical trials. Liver tests should be evaluated at the start of and during the course of posaconazole therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver tests during posaconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Patient management should include laboratory evaluation of hepatic function (particularly liver tests and bilirubin). Discontinuation of posaconazole must be considered if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to posaconazole. 5.6 Renal Impairment Due to the variability in exposure with posaconazole delayed-release tablets, Noxafil \u00ae Oral Suspension, and Noxafil \u00ae PowderMix for Delayed-Release Oral Suspension, patients with severe renal impairment should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections [see . Dosage and Administration (2.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] 5.7 Midazolam Toxicity Concomitant administration of posaconazole delayed-release tablets with midazolam increases the midazolam plasma concentrations by approximately 5-fold. Increased plasma midazolam concentrations could potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects. Patients must be monitored closely for adverse effects associated with high plasma concentrations of midazolam and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists must be available to reverse these effects [see . Drug Interactions (7.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.8 Vincristine Toxicity Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole delayed-release tablets, with vincristine has been associated with neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions, including seizures, peripheral neuropathy, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and paralytic ileus. Reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole delayed-release tablets, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options [see . Drug Interactions (7.10) ] 5.10 Breakthrough Fungal Infections Patients who have severe diarrhea or vomiting should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections when receiving posaconazole delayed-release tablets. 5.11 Venetoclax Toxicity Concomitant administration of posaconazole delayed-release tablets, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with venetoclax may increase venetoclax toxicities, including the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), neutropenia, and serious infections.

Clinical Trial Experience in Adults Clinical Trial Experience with P osaconazole Delayed-Release Tablets for Prophylaxis The safety of posaconazole delayed-release tablets has been assessed in 230 patients in clinical trials. Patients were enrolled in a non-comparative pharmacokinetic and safety trial of posaconazole delayed-release tablets when given as antifungal prophylaxis (Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablet Study). Patients were immunocompromised with underlying conditions including hematological malignancy, neutropenia postchemotherapy, GVHD, and post HSCT. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 51 years (range 19-78 years, 17% of patients were \u226565 years of age), and were 93% white and 16% Hispanic. Posaconazole therapy was given for a median duration of 28 days . Twenty patients received 200 mg daily dose and 210 patients received 300 mg daily dose (following twice daily dosing on Day 1 in each cohort). Table 9 presents adverse reactions observed in patients treated with 300 mg daily dose at an incidence of \u226510% in Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablet Study. Table 9: Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablet Study: Adverse Reactions in at Least 10% of Subjects Treated with 300 mg Daily Dose Body System Posaconazole delayed- release tablet (300 mg) n=210 (%) Subjects Reporting any Adverse Reaction 207 (99) Blood and Lymphatic System Disorder Anemia 22 (10) Thrombocytopenia 29 (14) Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal Pain 23 (11) Constipation 20 (10) Diarrhea 61 (29) Nausea 56 (27) Vomiting 28 (13) General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Asthenia 20 (10) Chills 22 (10) Mucosal Inflammation 29 (14) Edema Peripheral 33 (16) Pyrexia 59 (28) Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hypokalemia 46 (22) Hypomagnesemia 20 (10) Nervous System Disorders Headache 30 (14) Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders Cough 35 (17) Epistaxis 30 (14) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 34 (16) Vascular Disorders Hypertension 23 (11) The most frequently reported adverse reactions (>25%) with posaconazole delayed-release tablets 300 mg once daily were diarrhea, pyrexia, and nausea. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of posaconazole delayed-release tablets 300 mg once daily was nausea (2%). Additional Pediatric Use information is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.\u2019s NOXAFIL (posaconazole) delayed-release tablets. However, due to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during the post-approval use of posaconazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency. Endocrine Disorders: Pseudoaldosteronism",
