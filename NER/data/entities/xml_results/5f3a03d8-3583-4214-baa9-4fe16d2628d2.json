    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sirolimus oral solution is     an mTOR inhibitor immunosuppressant indicated for the prophylaxis of organ     rejection in patients aged \u226513 years receiving renal\u00a0transplants: Patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk: Use         initially with cyclosporine (CsA) and corticosteroids. CsA withdrawal is         recommended\u00a02-4\u00a0months\u00a0after\u00a0transplantation\u00a0( 1.1 ). Patients at high-immunologic risk: Use in         combination with CsA and corticosteroids for the first 12 months following         transplantation ( 1.1 ). Safety and efficacy of CsA withdrawal has not\u00a0been\u00a0established\u00a0in\u00a0high\u00a0risk\u00a0patients\u00a0( 1.1 , 1.2 , 14.3 ). Sirolimus\u00a0 oral solution is an mTOR inhibitor indicated     for the treatment of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis\u00a0( 1.3 ). 1.1 Prophylaxis of Organ Rejection in Renal Transplantation Sirolimus oral solution is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years or older receiving renal transplants. In patients at low-to moderate-immunologic risk , it is recommended that sirolimus oral solution be used initially in a regimen with cyclosporine and corticosteroids; cyclosporine should be withdrawn 2 to 4 months after transplantation [ see Dosage and Administration ( ]. 2.2 ) In patients at high-immunologic risk (defined as Black recipients and/or repeat renal transplant recipients who lost a previous allograft for immunologic reason and/or patients with high panel-reactive antibodies [PRA; peak PRA level >80%]), it is recommended that sirolimus oral solution be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first year following transplantation [ see Dosage and Administration ( , 2.3 ) Clinical Studies ( ]. 14.3 ) 1.2 Limitations of Use in Renal Transplantation Cyclosporine withdrawal has not been studied in patients with Banff Grade 3 acute rejection or vascular rejection prior to cyclosporine withdrawal, those who are dialysis-dependent, those with serum creatinine >4.5 mg/dL, Black patients, patients of multi-organ transplants, secondary transplants, or those with high levels of panel-reactive antibodies [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. 14.2 ) In patients at high-immunologic risk , the safety and efficacy of sirolimus used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids has not been studied beyond one year; therefore after the first 12 months following transplantation, any adjustments to the immunosuppressive regimen should be considered on the basis of the clinical status of the patient [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. 14.3 ) In pediatric patients , the safety and efficacy of sirolimus have not been established in patients <13 years old, or in pediatric (<18 years) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6.5 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.6 ) The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine have not been established in renal transplant patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.12 ) The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. 14.4 ) 1.3 Treatment of Patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Sirolimus oral solution is indicated for the treatment of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).",

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions ( 5.4 ) Angioedema ( 5.5 ) Fluid Accumulation and Impairment of Wound Healing     ( 5.6 ) Hyperlipidemia ( 5.7 ) Decline in Renal Function ( 5.8 ) Proteinuria ( 5.9 ) Latent Viral Infections ( 5.10 ) Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis     ( 5.11 ) De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine (5.12 ) Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced     Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/ Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/ Thrombotic     Microangiopathy ( 5.13 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Use of     highly effective contraception is recommended for females of reproductive     potential during treatment and for 12 weeks after final dose of sirolimus ( 5.15 , 8.1 ) Male Infertility: Azoospermia or oligospermia may     occur ( 5.16 , 13.1 ) Immunizations: Avoid live vaccines ( 5.19 ) 5.1 Increased Susceptibility to Infection and the Possible Development of Lymphoma Increased susceptibility to infection and the possible development of lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, may result from immunosuppression. The rates of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease observed in Studies 1 and 2 were 0.7-3.2% (for sirolimus-treated patients) versus 0.6-0.8% (azathioprine and placebo control) [ see Adverse Reactions ( and 6.1 ) ( ]. Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, fatal infections, and sepsis. Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use sirolimus for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources. The physician responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow-up of the patient. 6.2 ) 5.2 Liver Transplantation \u2013 Excess Mortality, Graft Loss, and Hepatic Artery Thrombosis The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in liver transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. The use of sirolimus has been associated with adverse outcomes in patients following liver transplantation, including excess mortality, graft loss and hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT). In a study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with tacrolimus was associated with excess mortality and graft loss (22% in combination versus 9% on tacrolimus alone). Many of these patients had evidence of infection at or near the time of death. In this and another study in de novo liver transplant patients, the use of sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine or tacrolimus was associated with an increase in HAT (7% in combination versus 2% in the control arm); most cases of HAT occurred within 30 days post-transplantation, and most led to graft loss or death. In a clinical study in stable liver transplant patients 6-144 months post-liver transplantation and receiving a CNI-based regimen, an increased number of deaths was observed in the group converted to a sirolimus-based regimen compared to the group who was continued on a CNI-based regimen, although the difference was not statistically significant (3.8% versus 1.4%) [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. 14.5 ) 5.3 Lung Transplantation \u2013 Bronchial Anastomotic Dehiscence Cases of bronchial anastomotic dehiscence, most fatal, have been reported in de novo lung transplant patients when sirolimus has been used as part of an immunosuppressive regimen. The safety and efficacy of sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy have not been established in lung transplant patients; therefore, such use is not recommended. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis and hypersensitivity vasculitis, have been associated with the administration of sirolimus [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6.7 ) 5.5 Angioedema Sirolimus has been associated with the development of angioedema. The concomitant use of sirolimus with other drugs known to cause angioedema, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, may increase the risk of developing angioedema. Elevated sirolimus levels (with/without concomitant ACE inhibitors) may also potentiate angioedema [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. In some cases, the angioedema has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. 7.2 ) 5.6 Fluid Accumulation and Impairment of Wound Healing There have been reports of impaired or delayed wound healing in patients receiving sirolimus, including lymphocele and wound dehiscence [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as sirolimus have been shown 6.1 ) in vitro to inhibit production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability. Lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurred significantly more often in a dose-related fashion in patients treated with sirolimus [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. Appropriate measures should be considered to minimize such complications. Patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m 6.1 ) 2 may be at increased risk of abnormal wound healing based on data from the medical literature. There have also been reports of fluid accumulation, including peripheral edema, lymphedema, pleural effusion, ascites, and pericardial effusions (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults), in patients receiving sirolimus. 5.7 Hyperlipidemia Increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides requiring treatment occurred more frequently in patients treated with sirolimus compared with azathioprine or placebo controls in Studies 1 and 2 [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. There were increased incidences of hypercholesterolemia (43-46%) and/or hypertriglyceridemia (45- 57%) in patients receiving sirolimus compared with placebo controls (each 23%). The risk/benefit should be carefully considered in patients with established hyperlipidemia before initiating an immunosuppressive regimen including sirolimus. 6.1 ) Any patient who is administered sirolimus should be monitored for hyperlipidemia. If detected, interventions such as diet, exercise, and lipid-lowering agents should be initiated as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. In clinical trials of patients receiving sirolimus plus cyclosporine or sirolimus after cyclosporine withdrawal, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels. The concomitant administration of sirolimus and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors resulted in adverse reactions such as CPK elevations (3%), myalgia (6.7%) and rhabdomyolysis (<1%). In these trials, the number of patients was too small and duration of follow-up too short to evaluate the long-term impact of sirolimus on cardiovascular mortality. During sirolimus therapy with or without cyclosporine, patients should be monitored for elevated lipids, and patients administered an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and/or fibrate should be monitored for the possible development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects, as described in the respective labeling for these agents. 5.8 Decline in Renal Function Renal function should be closely monitored during the co-administration of sirolimus with cyclosporine, because long-term administration of the combination has been associated with deterioration of renal function. Patients treated with cyclosporine and sirolimus were noted to have higher serum creatinine levels and lower glomerular filtration rates compared with patients treated with cyclosporine and placebo or azathioprine controls (Studies 1 and 2). The rate of decline in renal function in these studies was greater in patients receiving sirolimus and cyclosporine compared with control therapies. Appropriate adjustment of the immunosuppressive regimen, including discontinuation of sirolimus and/or cyclosporine, should be considered in patients with elevated or increasing serum creatinine levels. In patients at low- to moderate-immunologic risk, continuation of combination therapy with cyclosporine beyond 4 months following transplantation should only be considered when the benefits outweigh the risks of this combination for the individual patients. Caution should be exercised when using agents (e.g., aminoglycosides and amphotericin B) that are known to have a deleterious effect on renal function. In patients with delayed graft function, sirolimus may delay recovery of renal function. 5.9 Proteinuria Periodic quantitative monitoring of urinary protein excretion is recommended. In a study evaluating conversion from calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients 6-120 months post- transplant, increased urinary protein excretion was commonly observed from 6 through 24 months after conversion to sirolimus compared with CNI continuation [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. Patients with the greatest amount of urinary protein excretion prior to sirolimus conversion were those whose protein excretion increased the most after conversion. New onset nephrosis (nephrotic syndrome) was also reported as a treatment-emergent adverse reaction in 2.2% of the sirolimus conversion group patients in comparison to 0.4% in the CNI continuation group of patients. Nephrotic range proteinuria (defined as urinary protein to creatinine ratio >3.5) was also reported in 9.2% in the sirolimus conversion group of patients in comparison to 3.7% in the CNI continuation group of patients. In some patients, reduction in the degree of urinary protein excretion was observed for individual patients following discontinuation of sirolimus. The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant patients have not been established. 14.4 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.4 ) 5.10 Latent Viral Infections Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for opportunistic infections, including activation of latent viral infections. These include BK virus-associated nephropathy, which has been observed in renal transplant patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for BK virus-associated nephropathy. Reduction in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of BK virus-associated nephropathy. 6.7 ) Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. PML commonly presents with hemiparesis, apathy, confusion, cognitive deficiencies and ataxia. Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function. In immunosuppressed patients, physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated. Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop PML. In transplant patients, physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the graft. 5.11 Interstitial Lung Disease/Non-Infectious Pneumonitis Cases of interstitial lung disease [ILD] (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the ILD was reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]) as a secondary event. In some cases, the ILD has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the trough sirolimus concentration increases [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6.7 ) 5.12 De Novo Use Without Cyclosporine The safety and efficacy of de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine is not established in renal transplant patients. In a multicenter clinical study, de novo renal transplant patients treated with sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), steroids, and an IL-2 receptor antagonist had significantly higher acute rejection rates and numerically higher death rates compared to patients treated with cyclosporine, MMF, steroids, and IL-2 receptor antagonist. A benefit, in terms of better renal function, was not apparent in the treatment arm with de novo use of sirolimus without cyclosporine. These findings were also observed in a similar treatment group of another clinical trial. 5.13 Increased Risk of Calcineurin Inhibitor-Induced Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome/Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Thrombotic Microangiopathy The concomitant use of sirolimus with a calcineurin inhibitor may increase the risk of calcineurin inhibitor- induced hemolytic uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP/TMA) [ see Adverse Reactions ( ]. 6.7 ) 5.14 Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia have been reported in transplant patients not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis. Therefore, antimicrobial prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia should be administered for 1 year following transplantation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis is recommended for 3 months after transplantation, particularly for patients at increased risk for CMV disease. 5.15 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( ], sirolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal studies, sirolimus caused embryo-fetal toxicity when administered during the period of organogenesis at maternal exposures that were equal to or less than human exposures at the recommended lowest starting dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception while using sirolimus and for 12 weeks after ending treatment [ 12.1 ) see Use in Specific Populations ( ] 8.1 ) . 5.16 Male Infertility Azoospermia or oligospermia may be observed [ ] see Adverse Reactions (6.7) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 ) . Sirolimus is an anti-proliferative drug and affects rapidly dividing cells like the germ cells. 5.17 Different Sirolimus Trough Concentrations Reported between Chromatographic and Immunoassay Methodologies Currently in clinical practice, sirolimus whole blood concentrations are being measured by various chromatographic and immunoassay methodologies. Patient sample concentration values from different assays may not be interchangeable [ see Dosage and Administration ( ]. 2.5 ) 5.18 Skin Cancer Events Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for skin cancer. Exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a broad spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor [ see Adverse Reactions ( ] 6.1 , 6.2 , 6.7 ) . 5.19 Immunizations The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with sirolimus; live vaccines may include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid. Immunosuppressants may affect response to vaccination. Therefore, during treatment with sirolimus, vaccination may be less effective. 5.20 Interaction with Strong Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, or clarithromycin) or strong inducers of CYP3A4 and/or P-gp (such as rifampin or rifabutin) [ see Drug Interactions ( ]. 7.2 ) 5.21\tCannabidiol Drug Interactions When cannabidiol and sirolimus are co-administered, closely monitor for an increase in sirolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of sirolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of sirolimus should be considered as needed when sirolimus is co-administered with cannabidiol [ see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Drug Interactions (7.5) ].",

The most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions observed with sirolimus in the clinical study for the treatment of\u00a0LAM\u00a0are:\u00a0stomatitis,\u00a0diarrhea,\u00a0abdominal\u00a0pain,\u00a0nausea,\u00a0nasopharyngitis,\u00a0acne,\u00a0chest\u00a0pain,\u00a0peripheral\u00a0edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and\u00a0hypercholesterolemia. The following adverse reactions resulted in a rate of discontinuation of >5% in clinical trials for renal transplant rejection prophylaxis: creatinine increased, hypertriglyceridemia, and TTP. In patients with LAM, 11% of subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions, with no single adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in more than one patient being treated with sirolimus. Prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants: Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226530%) are peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, creatinine increased, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, nausea, arthralgia, pain, and thrombocytopenia ( 6 ). Lymphangioleiomyomatosis: Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) are stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia ( 6.6 ).

The safety profiles in the two studies were similar. 14.1 ) The incidence of adverse reactions in the randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 2) in which 219 renal transplant patients received sirolimus oral solution 2 mg/day, 208 received sirolimus oral solution 5 mg/day, and 124 received placebo is presented in Table 1 below. The study population had a mean age of 46 years (range 15 to 71 years), the distribution was 67% male, and the composition by race was: White (78%), Black (11%), Asian (3%), Hispanic (2%), and Other (5%). All patients were treated with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Data (\u2265 12 months post-transplant) presented in the following table show the adverse reactions that occurred in at least one of the sirolimus treatment groups with an incidence of \u226520%. The safety profile of the tablet did not differ from that of the oral solution formulation [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. 14.1 ) In general, adverse reactions related to the administration of sirolimus were dependent on dose/concentration. Although a daily maintenance dose of 5 mg, with a loading dose of 15 mg, was shown to be safe and effective, no efficacy advantage over the 2 mg dose could be established for renal transplant patients. Patients receiving 2 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day demonstrated an overall better safety profile than did patients receiving 5 mg of sirolimus oral solution per day. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In Studies 1 and 2, in de novo renal transplant patients who began the study with fasting, total serum cholesterol <200 mg/dL or fasting, total serum triglycerides <200 mg/dL, there was an increased incidence of hypercholesterolemia (fasting serum cholesterol >240 mg/dL) or hypertriglyceridemia (fasting serum triglycerides >500 mg/dL), respectively, in patients receiving both sirolimus 2 mg and sirolimus 5 mg compared with azathioprine and placebo controls. Treatment of new-onset hypercholesterolemia with lipid-lowering agents was required in 42-52% of patients enrolled in the sirolimus arms of Studies 1 and 2 compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm and 22% of patients in the azathioprine arm. In other sirolimus renal transplant studies, up to 90% of patients required treatment for hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia with anti-lipid therapy (e.g., statins, fibrates). Despite anti-lipid management, up to 50% of patients had fasting serum cholesterol levels >240 mg/dL and triglycerides above recommended target levels [ see Warnings and Precautions ( ]. 5.7 ) Abnormal Healing Abnormal healing events following transplant surgery include fascial dehiscence, incisional hernia, and anastomosis disruption (e.g., wound, vascular, airway, ureteral, biliary). Malignancies Table 2 below summarizes the incidence of malignancies in the two controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) for the prevention of acute rejection [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. 14.1 ) At 24 months (Study 1) and 36 months (Study 2) post-transplant, there were no significant differences among treatment groups.

All patients were treated with corticosteroids. The safety profile prior to randomization (start of cyclosporine withdrawal) was similar to that of the 2 mg sirolimus\u00a0groups in Studies 1 and 2. 14.2 ) Following randomization (at 3 months), patients who had cyclosporine eliminated from their therapy experienced higher incidences of the following adverse reactions: abnormal liver function tests (including increased AST/SGOT and increased ALT/SGPT), hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal healing. Conversely, the incidence of the following adverse events was higher in patients who remained on cyclosporine than those who had cyclosporine withdrawn from therapy: hypertension, cyclosporine toxicity, increased creatinine, abnormal kidney function, toxic nephropathy, edema, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and gum hyperplasia. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure improved significantly following cyclosporine withdrawal. Malignancies The incidence of malignancies in Study 3 [ see Clinical Studies ( ] is presented in Table 3. 14.2 ) In Study 3, the incidence of lymphoma/lymphoproliferative disease was similar in all treatment groups. The overall incidence of malignancy was higher in patients receiving sirolimus\u00a0plus cyclosporine compared with patients who had cyclosporine withdrawn. Conclusions regarding these differences in the incidence of malignancy could not be made because Study 3 was not designed to consider malignancy risk factors or systematically screen subjects for malignancy. In addition, more patients in the sirolimus\u00a0with cyclosporine group had a pre-transplantation history of skin carcinoma.

Overall, the incidence and nature of adverse reactions was similar to those seen in previous combination studies with sirolimus. The incidence of malignancy was 1.3% at 12 months. 14.3 ) 6.4 Conversion from Calcineurin Inhibitors to Sirolimus Oral Solution in Maintenance Renal Transplant Population The safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus in maintenance renal transplant population have not been established [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. In a study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus (initial target sirolimus concentrations of 12-20 ng/mL, and then 8-20 ng/mL, by chromatographic assay) in maintenance renal transplant patients, enrollment was stopped in the subset of patients (n = 87) with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min. There was a higher rate of serious adverse events, including pneumonia, acute rejection, graft loss and death, in this stratum of the sirolimus treatment arm. 14.4 ) The subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of less than 40 mL/min had 2 years of follow-up after randomization. In this population, the rate of pneumonia was 25.9% (15/58) versus 13.8% (4/29), graft loss (excluding death with functioning graft loss) was 22.4% (13/58) versus 31.0% (9/29), and death was 15.5% (9/58) versus 3.4% (1/29) in the sirolimus conversion group and CNI continuation group,\u00a0respectively. In the subset of patients with a baseline glomerular filtration rate of greater than 40 mL/min, there was no benefit associated with conversion with regard to improvement in renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria in the sirolimus conversion arm. Overall in this study, a 5-fold increase in the reports of tuberculosis among sirolimus 2.0% (11/551) and comparator 0.4% (1/273) treatment groups was observed with 2:1 randomization scheme. In a second study evaluating the safety and efficacy of conversion from tacrolimus to sirolimus 3 to 5 months post-kidney transplant, a higher rate of adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, acute rejection, and new onset diabetes mellitus was observed following conversion to sirolimus. There was also no benefit with respect to renal function and a greater incidence of proteinuria was observed after conversion to sirolimus [(see Clinical Studies ( ) 14.4 ] . 6.5 Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients Safety was assessed in a controlled clinical trial in pediatric (<18 years of age) renal transplant patients considered at high-immunologic risk, defined as a history of one or more acute allograft rejection episodes and/or the presence of chronic allograft nephropathy on a renal biopsy [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. The use of sirolimus\u00a0in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids was associated with a higher incidence of deterioration of renal function (creatinine increased) compared to calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy, serum lipid abnormalities (including, but not limited to, increased serum triglycerides and cholesterol), and urinary tract infections. 14.6 ) 6.6 Patients with Lymphangioleiomyomatosis Safety was assessed in a controlled trial involving 89 patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, 46 of whom were treated with sirolimus [ see Clinical Studies ( ]. The adverse drug reactions observed in this trial were consistent with the known safety profile for renal transplant patients receiving sirolimus, with the addition of weight decreased which was reported at a greater incidence with sirolimus when compared to placebo. Adverse reactions occurring at a frequency of \u226520% in the sirolimus treatment group and greater than placebo include stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, nasopharyngitis, acne, chest pain, peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, myalgia, and hypercholesterolemia. 14.7 ) 6.7 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sirolimus in transplant patients. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2013 Lymphedema. \u2022 Body as a Whole \u2022 \u2013 Pericardial effusion (including hemodynamically significant effusions and tamponade requiring intervention in children and adults) and fluid accumulation. Cardiovascular \u2022 \u2013 Ascites. Digestive System \u2022 \u2013 Pancytopenia, neutropenia. Hematological/Lymphatic \u2022 \u2013 Hepatotoxicity, including fatal hepatic necrosis, with elevated sirolimus trough concentrations. Hepatobiliary Disorders \u2022 \u2013 Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, angioedema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis Immune System [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. \u2022 \u2013 Tuberculosis. BK virus associated nephropathy has been observed in patients receiving immunosuppressants, including sirolimus. This infection may be associated with serious outcomes, including deteriorating renal function and renal graft loss. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), sometimes fatal, have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including sirolimus Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. Clostridium difficile enterocolitis . \u2022 \u2013 Liver function test abnormal, AST/SGOT increased, ALT/SGPT increased, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus. Metabolic/Nutritional \u2022 - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Nervous system \u2022 \u2013 Cases of interstitial lung disease (including pneumonitis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia [BOOP], and pulmonary fibrosis), some fatal, with no identified infectious etiology have occurred in patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens including sirolimus. In some cases, the interstitial lung disease has resolved upon discontinuation or dose reduction of sirolimus. The risk may be increased as the sirolimus trough concentration increases [ Respiratory see Warnings and Precautions ( ] 5.11 ) ; pulmonary hemorrhage; pleural effusion; alveolar proteinosis. \u2022 \u2013 Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin (Merkel cell carcinoma) [ Skin see Warnings and Precautions ( ], exfoliative dermatitis [ 5.18 ) see Warnings and Precautions ( ] 5.4 ) . \u2022 \u2013 Nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, ovarian cysts, menstrual disorders (including amenorrhea and menorrhagia). Azoospermia has been reported with the use of sirolimus and has been reversible upon discontinuation of sirolimus in most cases. Urogenital",
