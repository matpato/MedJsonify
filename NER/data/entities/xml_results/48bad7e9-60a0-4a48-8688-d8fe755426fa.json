    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma :  Monitor for increased intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy as needed. Discontinue if signs or symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions :  May cause psychiatric and cognitive effects, seizures and impair mental and/or physical abilities. Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment and during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women :  Avoid use in patients with severe preeclampsia. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders :  Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction; patients with pyloric obstruction, urinary bladder neck obstruction or receiving other anticholinergic drugs. Discontinue if patient develops difficulty in urination. ( 5.4 , 7.2 ) \u2022 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms :  Anticholinergic symptoms may occur 24 hours or more after removal of the transdermal system. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Blurred Vision :  Avoid contact with the eyes. ( 2.1 , 5.6 ) \u2022 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns :  Remove scopolamine transdermal system prior to MRI scan. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma The mydriatic effect of scopolamine may cause an increase in intraocular pressure resulting in acute angle closure glaucoma. Monitor intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma and adjust glaucoma therapy during scopolamine transdermal system use, as needed. Advise patients to immediately remove the transdermal system and contact their healthcare provider if they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (e.g., eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Scopolamine has been reported to exacerbate psychosis. Other psychiatric reactions have also been reported, including acute toxic psychosis, agitation, speech disorder, hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions [see Adverse Reactions ( . Monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system. Also, monitor patients for new or worsening psychiatric symptoms during concomitant treatment with other drugs that are associated with similar psychiatric effects 6.2 )] [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 )] Seizures Seizures and seizure-like activity have been reported in patients receiving scopolamine. Weigh this potential risk against the benefits before prescribing scopolamine transdermal system to patients with a history of seizures, including those receiving anti-epileptic medication or who have risk factors that can lower the seizure threshold. Cognitive Adverse Reactions Scopolamine can cause drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion. Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system if signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment develop. Elderly and pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychiatric effects of scopolamine transdermal system. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Scopolamine transdermal system is not approved for use in pediatric patients 8.5 )] [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] Hazardous Activities Scopolamine transdermal system may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle, operating machinery or participating in underwater sports. Concomitant use of other drugs that cause central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, and anxiolytics) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may increase this effect [see Drug Interactions ( . Inform patients not to operate motor vehicles or other dangerous machinery or participate in underwater sports until they are reasonably certain that scopolamine transdermal system does not affect them adversely. 7.1 )] 5.3 Eclamptic Seizures in Pregnant Women Eclamptic seizures have been reported in pregnant women with severe preeclampsia soon after injection of intravenous and intramuscular scopolamine [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Avoid use of scopolamine transdermal system in patients with severe preeclampsia. 5.4 Gastrointestinal and Urinary Disorders Scopolamine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can decrease gastrointestinal motility and cause urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients suspected of having intestinal obstruction, patients with pyloric obstruction or urinary bladder neck obstruction and patients receiving other anticholinergic drugs [see Drug Interactions ( . Discontinue scopolamine transdermal system in patients who develop difficulty in urination. 7.2 )] 5.5 Drug Withdrawal/Post-Removal Symptoms Discontinuation of scopolamine transdermal system, usually after several days of use, may result in withdrawal symptoms, such as disturbances of equilibrium, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, sweating, headache, mental confusion, muscle weakness, bradycardia and hypotension. The onset of these symptoms is generally 24 hours or more after the transdermal system has been removed. Instruct patients to seek medical attention if they experience severe symptoms. 5.6 Blurred Vision Scopolamine can cause temporary dilation of the pupils resulting in blurred vision if it comes in contact with the eyes. Advise patients to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry their hands immediately after handling the transdermal system [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.1 )] 5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Skin Burns Scopolamine transdermal system contains an aluminized membrane. Skin burns have been reported at the application site in patients wearing an aluminized transdermal system during an MRI scan. Remove scopolamine transdermal system before undergoing an MRI.",

( 6.1 ) \u2022 PONV (\u2265 3%):  dry mouth, dizziness, somnolence, agitation, visual impairment, confusion, mydriasis and pharyngitis.

Motion Sickness The most common adverse reaction (approximately two thirds) was dry mouth. Less common adverse reactions, included drowsiness (less than one sixth), blurred vision and dilation of the pupils. PONV Common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 3% of patients in PONV clinical trials are shown in Table 1.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
