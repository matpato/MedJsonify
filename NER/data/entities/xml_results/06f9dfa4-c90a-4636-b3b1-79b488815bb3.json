    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Toxicity: QT prolongation and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with AGRYLIN. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. Monitor patients for cardiovascular effects. ( 5.1 ) Pulmonary Hypertension: Assess underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating therapy. ( 5.2 ) Bleeding Risk: Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding. ( 5.3 ) 5.1\tCardiovascular Toxicity Torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with AGRYLIN. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. During treatment with AGRYLIN monitor patients for cardiovascular effects and evaluate as necessary. AGRYLIN increases the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and increases the heart rate in healthy volunteers [ see . Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] Do not use AGRYLIN in patients with known risk factors for QT interval prolongation, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalemia [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Hepatic impairment increases anagrelide exposure and could increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for QTc prolongation and other cardiovascular adverse reactions. The potential risks and benefits of AGRYLIN therapy in a patient with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Reduce AGRYLIN dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use of AGRYLIN in patients with severe hepatic impairment. In patients with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms [see . Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] AGRYLIN is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor and may cause vasodilation, tachycardia, palpitations, and congestive heart failure. Other drugs that inhibit PDE3 have caused decreased survival when compared with placebo in patients with Class III-IV congestive heart failure [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] In patients with cardiac disease, use AGRYLIN only when the benefits outweigh the risks. 5.2 Pulmonary Hypertension Cases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in patients treated with AGRYLIN. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating and during AGRYLIN therapy [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3 Bleeding Risk Use of concomitant AGRYLIN and aspirin increased major hemorrhagic events in a postmarketing study. Assess the potential risks and benefits for concomitant use of AGRYLIN with aspirin, since bleeding risks may be increased. Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [see . Drug Interactions (7.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial lung diseases (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia and interstitial pneumonitis) have been reported to be associated with the use of AGRYLIN in post-marketing reports. Most cases presented with progressive dyspnea with lung infiltrations. The time of onset ranged from 1 week to several years after initiating AGRYLIN. If suspected, discontinue AGRYLIN and evaluate. Symptoms may improve after discontinuation [see . Adverse Reactions (6) ]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Pulmonary Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Bleeding Risk [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5%) are headache, palpitations, diarrhea, asthenia, edema, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, pain, dyspnea, cough, flatulence, vomiting, fever, peripheral edema, rash, chest pain, anorexia, tachycardia, malaise, paresthesia, back pain, pruritus, and dyspepsia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Takeda Pharmaceuticals\u00a0U.S.A., Inc. at 1-877-TAKEDA-7 (1-877-825-3327)- or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or\u00a0www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 \tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Studies in Adult Patients In three single-arm clinical studies, 942 patients [see diagnosed with myeloproliferative neoplasms of varying etiology (ET: 551; PV: 117; OMPN: 274) were exposed to AGRYLIN with a mean duration of approximately 65 weeks. Serious adverse reactions reported in these patients included the following: congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident, pericardial effusion Clinical Trials (14) ] [see , pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and pancreatitis. Of the 942 patients treated with AGRYLIN, 161 (17%) were discontinued from the study because of adverse reactions or abnormal laboratory test results. The most common adverse reactions resulting in treatment discontinuation were headache, diarrhea, edema, palpitations, and abdominal pain. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions to AGRYLIN (in 5% or greater of 942 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms) in clinical trials were listed in Table 1.

Other less frequent adverse reactions (<1%) were: Cardiac disorders : Ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia. Nervous system disorders : Hypoesthesia. Clinical Study in Pediatric Patients The frequency of adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients was similar to adult patients. The most common adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients were fever, epistaxis, headache, and fatigue during the 3-month AGRYLIN treatment in the study. Episodes of increased pulse and decreased systolic or diastolic blood pressure beyond the normal ranges in the absence of clinical symptoms were observed. Other adverse reactions reported in these pediatric patients receiving AGRYLIN treatment were palpitations, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, anorexia, fatigue, and muscle cramps. 6.2\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-marketing use of AGRYLIN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders : Prinzmetal angina, Torsades de pointes. Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders : Interstitial lung diseases (including allergic alveolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial pneumonitis) [see .
