    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets contains hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ] . Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets.\u00a0 Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused. Assess each patient\u2019s risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, and reassess all patients receiving Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see ] WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ; DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose . Opioids are sought for non-medical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and proper disposal of unused drug . Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical status [see ] OVERDOSAGE . Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are essential [see ] DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Overestimating the Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose. Accidental ingestion of even one dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, especially by children, can result in respiratory depression and death due to an overdose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see ] PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers . Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see ] DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver and assess the potential need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see ] PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers . Consider prescribing naloxone, based on the patient\u2019s risk factors for overdose, such as concomitant use of other CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or overdose. If naloxone is prescribed, educate patients and caregivers on how to treat with naloxone [see ] WARNINGS, Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse , Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants ; PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients/Caregivers . Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants, including alcohol (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone. Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see ; WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ]. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs). Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs [see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions , ]. Information for Patients Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients , ]. Pregnancy Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation\nStrategy (REMS) To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following: Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain. Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG . Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them. Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities. To obtain further information on the opioid analgesic REMS and for a list of accredited REMS CME/CE, call 800-503-0784, or log on to The FDA Blueprint can be found at www.opioidanalgesicrems.com . . www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSBlueprint Risks of Concomitant Use or Discontinuation of Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers Concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), may increase plasma concentrations of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and prolong opioid adverse reactions, which may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are achieved. ] WARNINGS Similarly, discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets-treated patients may increase hydrocodone plasma concentrations and prolong opioid adverse reactions. When adding CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuing CYP3A4 inducers in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets-treated patients, evaluate patients at frequent intervals and consider dosage reduction of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets until stable drug effects are achieved [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions Concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of an CYP3A4 inhibitor could decrease hydrocodone plasma concentrations, decrease opioid efficacy or, possibly, lead to a withdrawal syndrome in a patient who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone. When using Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuing CYP3A4 inhibitors, follow patients at frequent intervals and consider increasing the opioid dosage if needed to maintain adequate analgesia or if symptoms of opioid withdrawal occur [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions Hepatotoxicity Acetaminophen has been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. Most of the cases of liver injury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 4,000 milligrams per day, and often involve more than one acetaminophen-containing product. The excessive intake of acetaminophen may be intentional to cause self-harm or unintentional as patients attempt to obtain more pain relief or unknowingly take other acetaminophen-containing products. The risk of acute liver failure is higher in individuals with underlying liver disease and in individuals who ingest alcohol while taking acetaminophen. Instruct patients to look for acetaminophen or APAP on package labels and not to use more than one product that contains acetaminophen. Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately upon ingestion of more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day, even if they feel well. Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior. ]. Dependence Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , ]. WARNINGS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients The use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated. Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease : Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablet-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets [see ]. WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients : Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see ]. WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Regularly evaluate, particularly when initiating and titrating Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and when Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see . Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. ] WARNINGS; Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any\u00a0particular opioids particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. Severe Hypotension Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see . Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. In patients with circulatory shock Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may cause vasodilatation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with circulatory shock. ] PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions Serious Skin Reactions Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity/Anaphylaxis There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, pruritus, and vomiting. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergency medical attention. Instruct patients to discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets immediately and seek medical care if they experience these symptoms. Do not prescribe Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for patients with acetaminophen allergy [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients ]. Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Follow such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus. The administration of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets or other opioids may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. Hydrocodone may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. \u00a0Regularly evaluate patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablet therapy. Withdrawal Do not abruptly discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ]. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g, pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Drug InteractionsPRECAUTIONS Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and know how they will react to the medication [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients /Caregivers ]. Information for Patients/Caregivers Storage and Disposal: Because of the risks associated with accidental ingestion, misuse, and abuse, advise patients to store Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets securely, out of sight and reach of children, and in a location not accessible by others, including visitors to the home [see . Inform patients that leaving Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets unsecured can pose a deadly risk to others in the home. , WARNINGS ] DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Advise patients and caregivers that when medicines are no longer needed, they should be disposed of promptly. Expired, unwanted, or unused Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets should be disposed of by flushing the unused medication down the toilet if a drug take-back option is not readily available. Inform patients that they can visit www.fda.gov/drugdisposal for a complete list of medicines recommended for disposal by flushing, as well as additional information on disposal of unused medicines. Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Inform patients that the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, even when taken as recommended, can result in addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death [see Instruct patients not to share Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets with others and to take steps to protect Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets from theft or misuse. ]. WARNINGS Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Inform patients of the risk of life-threatening respiratory depression, including information that the risk is greatest when starting Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets or when the dosage is increased, and that it can occur even at recommended dosages. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see ]. WARNINGS, Life Threatening Respiratory Depression Accidental Ingestion Inform patients that accidental ingestion, especially by children, may result in respiratory depression or death [see . Instruct patients to take steps to Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and to dispose of unused Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets by flushing down the toilet. ] WARNINGS Interactions with Benzodiazepines and Other CNS Depressants Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, and not to use these concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider [see WARNINGS , ]. PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss with the patient and caregiver the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Inform patients and caregivers about the various ways to obtain naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program) [see ; WARNINGS, Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression ]. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose. Explain to patients and caregivers that naloxone\u2019s effects are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if naloxone is administered [see ]. OVERDOSAGE If naloxone is prescribed, also advise patients and caregivers: How to treat with naloxone in the event of an opioid overdose To tell family and friends about their naloxone and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency To read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their naloxone. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do. Hyperalgesia and Allodynia Inform patients and caregivers not to increase opioid dosage without first consulting a clinician. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see ]. WARNINGS , Adverse Reactions Serotonin Syndrome Inform patients that Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Interaction Inform patients to avoid taking Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen Tablets while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen Tablets [see . ] PRECAUTIONS; Drug Interactions Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients how to properly take Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , ]. WARNINGS Important Discontinuation Instructions In order to avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see ]. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Maximum Daily Dose of Acetaminophen Inform patients not to take more than 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen per day. Advise patients to call their prescriber if they take more than the recommended dose. Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery Inform patients that Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see ]. WARNINGS Constipation Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see ADVERSE REACTIONS , ]. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Adrenal Insufficiency Inform patients that Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see ]. WARNINGS Hypotension Inform patients that Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) [see ]. WARNINGS Anaphylaxis Inform patients that anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. Advise patients how to recognize such a reaction and when to seek medical attention [see , CONTRAINDICATIONS ]. ADVERSE REACTIONS Pregnancy Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Inform female patients of reproductive potential that use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for an extended period of time\u00a0during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated [see , WARNINGS ]. PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Inform female patients of reproductive potential that Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets can cause fetal harm and to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy Lactation Advise nursing mothers to carefully observe\u00a0infants for increased sleepiness (more than usual), breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to seek immediate medical care if they notice these signs [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Nursing Mothers Infertility Inform patients that use of opioids for an extended period of time\u00a0may cause reduced fertility. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see ]. ADVERSE REACTIONS Laboratory Tests In patients with severe hepatic or renal disease, effects of therapy should be followed with serial liver and/or renal function tests. DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 The concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), and protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), can increase the plasma concentration of the hydrocodone from Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are achieved [see ]. WARNINGS After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the hydrocodone plasma concentration will decrease [see , resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate patients at frequent intervals for respiratory depression and sedation. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal. Inducers of CYP3A4 The concomitant use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, can decrease the plasma concentration of hydrocodone [see , resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to hydrocodone ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY [see ]. WARNINGS After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the hydrocodone plasma concentration will increase [see , which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression. ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved.\u00a0 Evaluate the patient for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage reduction and evaluate patients at frequent intervals for signs of respiratory depression and sedation. Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines and other sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see WARNINGS ]. Serotonergic Drugs The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see ]. PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets immediately if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) The concomitant use of opioids and MAOIs, such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, or linezolid, may manifest as serotonin syndrome, or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see ]. WARNINGS The use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression. Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics The concomitant use of opioids with other opioid analgesics, such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, may reduce the analgesic effect of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Advise patient to avoid concomitant use of these drugs. Muscle Relaxants Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression. Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see WARNINGS ]. Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. Anticholinergic Drugs The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus. Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the combination of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets have not been conducted. Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were fed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6,000 ppm. Female rats demonstrated equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia at 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD) of 4 grams/day, based on a body surface area comparison. In contrast, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in male rats that received up to 0.7 times or mice at up to 1.2 to 1.4 times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison. Mutagenesis In the published literature, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic when administered at 1,500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison). In contrast, no clastogenicity was noted at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (1.8-times the MHDD, based on a body surface area comparison), suggesting a threshold effect. Impairment of Fertility In studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program, fertility assessments with acetaminophen have been completed in Swiss CD-1 mice via a continuous breeding study. There were no effects on fertility parameters in mice consuming up to 1.7 times the MHDD of acetaminophen, based on a body surface area comparison. Although there was no effect on sperm motility or sperm density in the epididymis, there was a significant increase in the percentage of abnormal sperm in mice consuming 1.78 times the MHDD (based on a body surface comparison) and there was a reduction in the number of mating pairs producing a fifth litter at this dose, suggesting the potential for cumulative toxicity with chronic administration of acetaminophen near the upper limit of daily dosing. Published studies in rodents report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced spermatogenesis, reduced fertility, and reduced implantation sites in females given the same doses. These effects appear to increase with the duration of treatment. The clinical significance of these findings is not known. Infertility Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see ]. ADVERSE REACTIONS Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Use of opioid for an extended period of time analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, high pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn. Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [see ]. WARNINGS Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression. Nursing Mothers Hydrocodone is present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Infants exposed to Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets. In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration. Titrate the dosage of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets slowly in geriatric patients and frequently reevaluate the patient for signs of central nervous system and respiratory depression [see ]. WARNINGS Hydrocodone and acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment may have higher plasma hydrocodone concentrations than those with normal function. Use a low initial dose of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in patients with hepatic impairment and follow closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression and sedation. Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment may have higher plasma hydrocodone concentrations than those with normal function. Use a low initial dose Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets in patients with renal impairment and follow closely for adverse events such as respiratory depression and sedation.",
