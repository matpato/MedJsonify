    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myelosuppression : Monitor complete blood count (CBC) and adjust the dose of mercaptopurine tablets for excessive myelosuppression. Consider testing in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) or nucleotide diphosphatase (NUDT15) deficiency. Patients with homozygous or homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity : Monitor transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Withhold mercaptopurine tablets at onset of hepatotoxicity. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Immunosuppression : Response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Treatment Related Malignancies : Aggressive and fatal cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have occurred. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Macrophage Activation Syndrome : Monitor for and treat promptly; discontinue mercaptopurine tablets. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelosuppression The most consistent, dose-related adverse reaction is myelosuppression, manifested by anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination of these. Monitor CBC and adjust the dosage of mercaptopurine tablets for excessive myelosuppression [see . Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] Consider testing for TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression or repeated episodes of myelosuppression. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) and NUDT15 genotyping can identify patients who have reduced activity of these enzymes. Patients with heterozygous or homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency may require a dose reduction [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] Myelosuppression can be exacerbated by coadministration with allopurinol, aminosalicylates or other products that cause myelosuppression [see . Reduce the dose of mercaptopurine tablets when coadministered with allopurinol Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.3 , 7.4) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic. There are reports of deaths attributed to hepatic necrosis associated with the administration of mercaptopurine. Hepatic injury can occur with any dosage but seems to occur with greater frequency when the recommended dosage is exceeded. In some patients, jaundice has cleared following withdrawal of mercaptopurine and reappeared with rechallenge. Usually, clinically detectable jaundice appears early in the course of treatment (1 to 2 months); however, jaundice has been reported as early as 1 week and as late as 8 years after the starting mercaptopurine. The hepatotoxicity has been associated in some cases with anorexia, diarrhea, jaundice, ascites, and pruritus . Hepatic encephalopathy has occurred. Monitor serum transaminase levels, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels at weekly intervals when first beginning therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving mercaptopurine tablets with other hepatotoxic products [see or with known pre-existing liver disease. Withhold mercaptopurine tablets at onset of hepatotoxicity. Drug Interactions (7.5) ] Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy Postmarketing cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) have been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who received mercaptopurine during pregnancy. Mercaptopurine tablets are not indicated for use in inflammatory bowel disease [see . Indications and Usage (1.1) ] Discontinue mercaptopurine tablets if ICP develops in a pregnant woman. 5.3 Immunosuppression Mercaptopurine is immunosuppressive and may impair the immune response to infectious agents or vaccines. Due to the immunosuppression associated with maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, response to all vaccines may be diminished and there is a risk of infection with live virus vaccines. Consult immunization guidelines for immunocompromised patients. 5.4 Treatment Related Malignancies Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients treated with mercaptopurine for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), an unapproved use. Mercaptopurine is mutagenic in animals and humans, carcinogenic in animals, and may increase the risk of secondary malignancies. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the lymphoproliferative disorder. A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 5.5 Macrophage Activation Syndrome Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with the use of mercaptopurine (an unapproved use). If MAS occurs, or is suspected, discontinue mercaptopurine tablets. Monitor for and promptly treat infections such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known triggers for MAS. 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Mercaptopurine tablets can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. An increased incidence of miscarriage has been reported in women who received mercaptopurine in the first trimester of pregnancy. Adverse embryo-fetal findings, including miscarriage and stillbirth, have been reported in women who received mercaptopurine after the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with mercaptopurine tablets and for 3 months after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Treatment related malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Macrophage activation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] The most common adverse reaction (> 20%) is myelosuppression, including anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 (1-877-4-INFO-RX) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Based on multicenter cooperative group ALL trials, the most common adverse reaction occurring in > 20% of patients was myelosuppression, including anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 20% of patients included anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malaise and rash. Adverse reactions occurring in < 5 % of patients included urticaria, hyperuricemia, oral lesions, increased transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperpigmentation, infections, and pancreatitis. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations. Delayed or late adverse reactions include hepatic fibrosis, hyperbilirubinemia, alopecia, pulmonary fibrosis, oligospermia and secondary malignancies [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.2) ] Drug fever has been reported with mercaptopurine. Additional adverse reactions that have been reported in patients who have received mercaptopurine include photosensitivity, hypoglycemia, and portal hypertension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of mercaptopurine tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions include: intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP).",
