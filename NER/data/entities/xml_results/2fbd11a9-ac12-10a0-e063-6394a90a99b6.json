    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme: Discontinue oseltamivir phosphate capsules and initiate appropriate treatment if allergic-like reactions occur or are suspected. ( 5.1 ) Neuropsychiatric events: Patients with influenza, including those receiving oseltamivir phosphate capsules, particularly pediatric patients, may be at an increased risk of confusion or abnormal behavior early in their illness. Monitor for signs of abnormal behavior. ( 5.2 ) 5.1 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with oseltamivir phosphate capsules.\u00a0 Stop oseltamivir phosphate capsules and instituteappropriate treatment if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. The use of oseltamivir phosphate capsules is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir phosphate capsules [ see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.2 Neuropsychiatric Events There have been postmarketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving oseltamivir phosphate capsules [ see . Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on oseltamivir phosphate capsules usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of oseltamivir phosphate capsules to these events has not been established. Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease. Closely monitor oseltamivir phosphate capsules-treated patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing oseltamivir phosphate capsules for each patient. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.3 Risk of Bacterial Infections There is no evidence for efficacy of oseltamivir phosphate capsules in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Oseltamivir phosphate capsules have not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (>1% and more common than with placebo): Treatment studies \u2013 Nausea, vomiting, headache. ( 6.1 ) Prophylaxis studies \u2013 Nausea, vomiting, headache, pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus at 1-877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions [ see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.1) Neuropsychiatric events [ see ] Warnings and Precautions (5.2) 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Adult and Adolescent Subjects (13 years of age and older) The overall safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate is based on data from 2,646 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days for treatment of influenza and 1,943 adult and adolescent subjects that received the recommended dosage of 75 mg orally once daily for up to 6 weeks for prophylaxis of influenza in clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions in the pooled treatment and pooled prophylaxis trials in adults and adolescents are displayed in Table 5. The majority of these adverse reactions were reported on a single occasion, occurred on either the first or second treatment day and resolved spontaneously within 1-2 days.\u00a0 This summary includes otherwise healthy adults/adolescents and subjects \"at risk\" (subjects at higher risk of developing complications associated with influenza, e.g., elderly patients and patients with chronic cardiac or respiratory disease). In general, the safety profile in the subjects \"at risk\" was qualitatively similar to that in the otherwise healthy adults/adolescents. Table 5 Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22651% of Adults and Adolescents (13 years of age and older) in Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials Adverse reactions that occurred in \u22651% of oseltamivir phosphate-treated adults and adolescents and \u22651% greater in oseltamivir phosphate-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects in either the treatment or prophylaxis trials. System Organ Class Treatment Trials Prophylaxis Trials Adverse Reaction Oseltamivir Phosphate 75 mg twice daily (n = 2646) Placebo (n = 1977) Oseltamivir Phosphate 75 mg once daily (n = 1943) Placebo (n = 1586) Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 10% 6% 8% 4% Vomiting 8% 3% 2% 1% Nervous System Disorders Headache 2% 1% 17% 16% General Disorders Pain <1% <1% 4% 3% Adverse Reactions from Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials in Pediatric Subjects (1 year to 12 years of age) A total of 1,481 pediatric subjects (including otherwise healthy pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years and asthmatic pediatric subjects aged 6 to 12 years) participated in clinical trials of oseltamivir phosphate given for the treatment of influenza. A total of 859 pediatric subjects received treatment with oseltamivir phosphate for oral suspension either at a 2 mg per kg twice daily for 5 days or weight-band dosing. Vomiting was the only adverse reaction reported at a frequency of \u22651% in subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate (16%) compared to placebo (8%). Amongst the 148 pediatric subjects aged 1 year to 12 years who received oseltamivir phosphate at doses of 30 to 60 mg once daily for 10 days in a post-exposure prophylaxis study in household contacts (n = 99), and in a separate 6-week seasonal influenza prophylaxis safety study (n = 49), vomiting was the most frequent adverse reaction (8% on oseltamivir phosphate versus 2% in the no prophylaxis group). Adverse Reactions from Treatment Trials in Pediatric Subjects (2 weeks to less than 1 year of age) Assessment of adverse reactions in pediatric subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age\u00a0 was based on two open-label studies that included safety data on 135 influenza-infected subjects 2 weeks to less than 1 year of age (including premature infants at least 36 weeks post conceptional age) exposed to oseltamivir phosphate at doses ranging from 2 to 3.5 mg per kg of the formulation for oral suspension twice daily orally for 5 days. The safety profile of oseltamivir phosphate was similar across the age range studied, with vomiting (9%), diarrhea (7%) and diaper rash (7%) being the most frequently reported adverse reactions, and was generally comparable to that observed in older pediatric and adult subjects. Adverse Reactions from the Prophylaxis Trial in Immunocompromised Subjects In a 12-week seasonal prophylaxis study in 475 immunocompromised subjects, including 18 pediatric subjects 1 year to 12 years of age, the safety profile in the 238 subjects receiving oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg once daily was consistent with that previously observed in other oseltamivir phosphate prophylaxis clinical trials [ see . Clinical Studies (14.2) ] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oseltamivir phosphate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to oseltamivir phosphate exposure. General disorders and administration site conditions : Swelling of the face or tongue, allergy, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, hypothermia Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Rash, dermatitis, urticaria, eczema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Gastrointestinal Disorders: Gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic colitis Cardiac Disorders : Arrhythmia Hepatobiliary Disorders: Hepatitis, abnormal liver function tests. Nervous System Disorders : Seizure Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Aggravation of diabetes Psychiatric Disorders : Abnormal behavior, delirium, including symptoms such as hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, altered level of consciousness, confusion, nightmares, delusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]",
