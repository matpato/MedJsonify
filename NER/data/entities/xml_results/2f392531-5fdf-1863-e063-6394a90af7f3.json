    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection is indicated as adjunctive therapy in pediatric and adult patients for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia and associated encephalopathy in patients with deficiencies in enzymes of the urea cycle. During acute hyperammonemic episodes, arginine supplementation, caloric supplementation, dietary protein restriction, hemodialysis, and other ammonia lowering therapies should be considered [see ]. Warnings and Precautions (5) Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection is a nitrogen binding agent indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of acute hyperammonemia and associated encephalopathy in patients with deficiencies in enzymes of the urea cycle.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Decreased Potassium Levels : Plasma potassium levels should be carefully monitored and appropriate treatment given when necessary. ( 5.1 ) Conditions Associated with Fluid Overload : Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection contains 30.5 mg of sodium per mL of undiluted product. Caution should be used if Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection is administered to patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, or with conditions in which there is sodium retention with edema. ( 5.2 ) Extravasation : Extravasation of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection into the perivenous tissues during high flow bolus infusion may lead to skin necrosis, especially in infants. The infusion site must be monitored closely for possible tissue infiltration during drug administration. ( 5.3 ) Neurotoxicity of Phenylacetate : Because of prolonged plasma levels achieved by phenylacetate in pharmacokinetic studies, repeat loading doses should not be administered. Additionally, neurotoxicity related to phenylacetate has been reported in cancer patients. Monitor patients for symptoms of acute neurotoxicity. ( 5.4 ) Hyperventilation and Metabolic Acidosis : Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection may cause side effects typically associated with salicylate overdose, such as hyperventilation and metabolic acidosis. Monitor patient blood chemistry profiles and perform frequent blood pH and pCO 2 measurements. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Decreased Potassium Levels Because urine potassium loss is enhanced by the excretion of the non-reabsorbable anions, phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate, plasma potassium levels should be carefully monitored and appropriate treatment given when necessary. 5.2 Conditions Associated with Fluid Overload Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection contains 30.5 mg of sodium per mL of undiluted product. Thus, Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema. Discontinue administration of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection, evaluate the patient, and institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures if an adverse event occurs. 5.3 Extravasation Administration must be through a central venous catheter. Administration through a peripheral line may cause burns. Bolus infusion flow rates are relatively high, especially for infants [see ]. Extravasation of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection into the perivenous tissues may lead to skin necrosis. If extravasation is suspected, discontinue the infusion and resume at a different infusion site, if necessary. The infusion site must be monitored closely for possible infiltration during drug administration. Do not administer undiluted product. Dosage and Administration (2) 5.4 Neurotoxicity of Phenylacetate Because of prolonged plasma levels achieved by phenylacetate in pharmacokinetic studies, repeat loading doses of Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection should not be administered. Additionally, neurotoxicity was reported in cancer patients receiving intravenous phenylacetate, 250\u2013300 mg/kg/day for 14 days, repeated at 4-week intervals. Manifestations were predominantly somnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness, with less frequent headaches, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, disorientation, impaired memory, and exacerbation of a pre-existing neuropathy. The acute onset of symptoms upon initiation of treatment and reversibility of symptoms when the phenylacetate was discontinued suggest a drug effect [see ]. Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology (13.2) 5.5 Hyperventilation and Metabolic Acidosis Due to structural similarities between phenylacetate and benzoate to salicylate, Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection may cause side effects typically associated with salicylate overdose, such as hyperventilation and metabolic acidosis. Monitoring of blood chemistry profiles, blood pH and pCO 2 should be performed.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported adverse reactions (incidence \u22656%) are vomiting, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, convulsions, and mental impairment. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oceanside Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The safety data were obtained from 316 patients who received Sodium Phenylacetate and Sodium Benzoate Injection as emergency (rescue) or prospective treatment for hyperammonemia as part of an uncontrolled, open-label study. The study population included patients between the ages of 0 to 53 years with a mean (SD) of 6.2 (8.54) years; 51% were male and 49% were female who had the following diagnoses: OTC (46%), ASS (22%), CPS (12%), ASL (2%), ARG (<1%), THN (<1%), and other (18%). Adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in patients with OTC, ASS, CPS, and diagnoses categorized as \u201cother.\u201d Nervous system disorders were more frequent in patients with OTC and CPS, compared with patients with ASS and patients with \u201cother\u201d diagnoses. Convulsions and mental impairment were reported in patients with OTC and CPS. These observations are consistent with literature reports that patients with enzyme deficiencies occurring earlier in the urea cycle (i.e., OTC and CPS) tend to be more severely affected. Adverse reactions profiles differed by age group. Patients \u226430 days of age had more blood and lymphatic system disorders and vascular disorders (specifically hypotension), while patients >30 days of age had more gastrointestinal disorders (specifically nausea, vomiting and diarrhea). Less common adverse reactions (<3% of patients) that are characterized as severe are listed below by body system.
