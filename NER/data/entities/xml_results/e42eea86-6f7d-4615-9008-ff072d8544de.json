( 1.1 ) Post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in patients 5 years of age and older following contact with an individual who has influenza. ( 1.2 ) Limitations of Use Influenza viruses change over time, and factors such as the virus type or subtype, emergence of resistance, or changes in viral virulence could diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Consider available information on drug susceptibility patterns for circulating influenza virus strains when deciding whether to use XOFLUZA. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Influenza XOFLUZA is indicated for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 5 years of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours and who are otherwise healthy or at high risk of developing influenza-related complications 1 [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 1.2 Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of Influenza XOFLUZA is indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in persons 5 years of age and older following contact with an individual who has influenza [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. 1.3 Limitations of Use Influenza viruses change over time, and factors such as the virus type or subtype, emergence of resistance, or changes in viral virulence could diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs.

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and erythema multiforme: Initiate appropriate treatment if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. ( 5.1 ) Increased incidence of Treatment-Emergent Resistance in Patients Less Than 5 Years of Age: XOFLUZA is not indicated in patients less than 5 years of age due to increased incidence of treatment-emergent resistance in this age group . In clinical trials, incidence of virus with treatment-emergent substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir (resistance) was higher in pediatric subjects younger than 5 years of age than older subjects. ( 5.2 ) Risk of bacterial infection: Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with, or occur as, a complication of influenza. XOFLUZA has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to potential secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Cases of anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with XOFLUZA. Appropriate treatment should be instituted if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected. The use of XOFLUZA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to XOFLUZA [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.2\tIncreased Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Resistance in Patients Less Than 5 Years of Age XOFLUZA is not indicated in patients less than 5 years of age due to increased incidence of treatment-emergent resistance in this age group. In clinical trials, the incidence of virus with treatment-emergent substitutions associated with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir (resistance) was higher in pediatric subjects younger than 5 years of age (40%, 38/96) than in pediatric subjects \u2265 5 years to < 12 years of age (16%, 19/117) or subjects \u2265 12 years of age (7%, 60/842). The potential for transmission of resistant strains in the community has not been determined [see Indications and Usage (1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.4) , and Microbiology (12.4) ]. 5.3 Risk of Bacterial Infections There is no evidence of efficacy of XOFLUZA in any illness caused by pathogens other than influenza viruses. Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with, or occur as, a complication of influenza. XOFLUZA has not been shown to prevent such complications. Prescribers should be alert to potential secondary bacterial infections and treat them as appropriate.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse events reported in at least 1% of adult and adolescent influenza subjects treated with XOFLUZA included diarrhea (3%), bronchitis (3%), nausea (2%), sinusitis (2%), and headache (1%). ( 6.1 ) Adverse events reported in at least 5% of pediatric subjects (5 to < 12 years) treated with XOFLUZA included vomiting (5%) and diarrhea (5%). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The overall safety profile of XOFLUZA is based on data from 2,079 subjects, 5 years of age and older in 5 controlled clinical trials who received XOFLUZA. Of these subjects, 1,943 were adults and adolescents (\u2265 12 years of age) and 136 were in the pediatric age group (5 to < 12 years of age) [see . Clinical Studies (14) ] Treatment of Acute Uncomplicated Influenza Adult and Adolescent Subjects (\u2265 12 Years of Age): The safety of XOFLUZA in adult and adolescent subjects is based on data from 3 placebo-controlled trials in which a total of 1,640 subjects received XOFLUZA: 1,334 (81%) subjects were 18 to 64 years of age, 209 (13%) subjects were adults 65 years of age or older, and 97 (6%) subjects were adolescents 12 to 17 years of age. These trials included otherwise healthy adults and adolescents (N=910) and subjects at high risk of developing complications associated with influenza (N=730). Of these, 1,440 subjects received XOFLUZA at the recommended dose [see Trial T0821 was a phase 2 dose-finding placebo-controlled trial where otherwise healthy adult subjects 20 to 64 years of age received single oral dose of XOFLUZA or placebo. Trial T0831 was a placebo- and active-controlled trial in otherwise healthy adults and adolescents 12 to 64 years of age; subjects received weight-based XOFLUZA or placebo as a single oral dose on Day 1 or oseltamivir twice a day for 5 days. Trial T0832 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial where adults and adolescents at high risk of influenza complications 12 years of age and older received either XOFLUZA, placebo or oseltamivir. Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2) ]. Table 3 displays the most common adverse events (regardless of causality assessment) reported in at least 1% of adult and adolescent subjects who received XOFLUZA at the recommended dose in Trials T0821, T0831, and T0832. Table 3\tIncidence of Adverse Events Occurring in at Least 1% of Adult and Adolescent Subjects Receiving XOFLUZA in the Acute Uncomplicated Influenza Trials T0821, T0831, and T0832 Adverse Event XOFLUZA (N=1,440) Placebo (N=1,136) Diarrhea 3% 4% Bronchitis 3% 4% Nausea 2% 3% Sinusitis 2% 3% Headache 1% 1% Pediatric Subjects (5 to < 12 Years of Age): In an active-controlled, double-blind trial Trial CP40563 in pediatric subjects, a total of 79 subjects 5 to less than 12 years of age, received the recommended weight-based dosage of XOFLUZA, and 39 subjects received oseltamivir. Of the 118 subjects 5 to less than 12 years of age in Trial CP40563, 15 subjects in the XOFLUZA arm and 4 subjects in the oseltamivir arm were at high risk of developing influenza complications. The most frequently reported AEs (\u2265 5%) in all subjects in the XOFLUZA treatment arm were vomiting (5%) and diarrhea (5%).  Vomiting was reported in 18% of subjects in the oseltamivir arm [see There are limited safety data in patients 5 to <12 years at high risk of developing influenza complications. Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis of Influenza In a placebo-controlled clinical trial, Trial T0834, conducted in adults, and pediatric subjects \u2265 5 years of age, a total of 360 subjects received XOFLUZA, of which 291 (81%) were adults \u2265 18 years; 12 (3%) subjects were adolescents \u2265 12 to 17 years and 57 (16%) were pediatric subjects 5 to < 12 years of age. The safety profile was similar in pediatric patients aged 5 to < 12 years old as that reported in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of XOFLUZA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to XOFLUZA exposure. Immune System Disorders: Anaphylactic reactions, anaphylactic shock, anaphylactoid reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, angioedema (swelling of face, eyelids, tongue and lips) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash, urticaria, erythema multiforme Gastrointestinal Disorders: Vomiting, hematochezia, melena, colitis Psychiatric Disorders: Delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations",
