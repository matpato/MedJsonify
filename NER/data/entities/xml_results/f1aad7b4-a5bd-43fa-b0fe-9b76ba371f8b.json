    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5\tWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis may occur with any KRYSTEXXA infusion. Pre-medicate and monitor patients. ( 5.1 ) Infusion Reactions : Infusion reactions occurred in patients treated with KRYSTEXXA. Pre-medicate and monitor patients. ( 5.2 ) G6PD Deficiency Associated Hemolysis and Methemoglobinemia : Screen patients at risk for G6PD deficiency. Do not administer KRYSTEXXA to patients with G6PD deficiency. ( 5.3 ) Gout Flares : Gout flare prophylaxis is recommended for at least the first 6 months of KRYSTEXXA therapy. ( 5.4 ) Congestive Heart Failure : Congestive heart failure exacerbation may occur. Monitor patients closely following infusion. ( 5.5 ) 5.1\tAnaphylaxis In a 52-week controlled trial, which evaluated KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate compared to KRYSTEXXA alone, patients were pre-treated with standardized infusion reaction prophylaxis and were discontinued from treatment with KRYSTEXXA if serum uric acid levels increased to above 6 mg/dL at 2 consecutive visits after the initiation of KRYSTEXXA therapy to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis . One patient randomized to the group treated with KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate (1%) experienced anaphylaxis during the first infusion and no patients experienced anaphylaxis in the group treated with KRYSTEXXA alone [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14) ] During pre-marketing clinical trials with KRYSTEXXA alone, KRYSTEXXA was not discontinued following 2 consecutive serum uric acid levels above 6 mg/dL. Anaphylaxis was reported with a frequency of 6.5% (8/123) of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks and 4.8% (6/126) for the every 4-week dosing regimen. There were no cases of anaphylaxis in patients receiving placebo. Anaphylaxis generally occurred within 2 hours after treatment. Diagnostic criteria of anaphylaxis were skin or mucosal tissue involvement, and, either airway compromise, and/or reduced blood pressure with or without associated symptoms, and a temporal relationship to KRYSTEXXA or placebo injection with no other identifiable cause. Manifestations included wheezing, peri-oral or lingual edema, or hemodynamic instability, with or without rash or urticaria, nausea or vomiting. Cases occurred in patients being pre-treated with one or more doses of an oral antihistamine, an intravenous corticosteroid and/or acetaminophen. This pre-treatment may have blunted or obscured symptoms or signs of anaphylaxis and therefore the reported frequency may be an underestimate. KRYSTEXXA should be administered in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis. Patients should be pre-treated with antihistamines and corticosteroids. Anaphylaxis may occur with any infusion, including a first infusion, and generally manifests within 2 hours of the infusion. However, delayed type hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported. Patients should be closely monitored for an appropriate period of time for anaphylaxis after administration of KRYSTEXXA. Patients should be informed of the symptoms and signs of anaphylaxis and instructed to seek immediate medical care should anaphylaxis occur after discharge from the healthcare setting. The risk of anaphylaxis is higher in patients whose uric acid level increases to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and discontinue treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL. Because of the possibility that concomitant use of oral urate-lowering therapy and KRYSTEXXA may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels, it is recommended that before starting KRYSTEXXA patients discontinue oral urate-lowering medications and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering agents while taking KRYSTEXXA. 5.2\tInfusion Reactions In a 52-week, controlled trial which evaluated KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate compared to KRYSTEXXA alone [see , patients were pre-treated with standardized infusion reaction prophylaxis and were discontinued from treatment with KRYSTEXXA if serum uric acid levels increased to above 6 mg/dL at 2 consecutive visits after the initiation of KRYSTEXXA therapy to reduce the risk of infusion reactions Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14) ] . Infusion reactions were reported in 4% of patients in the KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate group compared to 31% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA alone experienced infusion reactions [see . In both treatment groups, the majority of infusion reactions occurred at the first or second KRYSTEXXA infusion and during the time of infusion. Manifestations of these infusion reactions were similar to that observed in the pre-marketing trials. Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14) During pre-marketing 24-week controlled clinical trials with KRYSTEXXA alone, KRYSTEXXA was not discontinued following 2 consecutive serum uric acid levels above 6 mg/dL. Infusion reactions were reported in 26% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, and 41% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, compared to 5% of patients treated with placebo. These infusion reactions occurred in patients being pre-treated with an oral antihistamine, intravenous corticosteroid and/or acetaminophen. This pre-treatment may have blunted or obscured symptoms or signs of infusion reactions and therefore the reported frequency may be an underestimate. Manifestations of these reactions included urticaria (frequency of 10.6%), dyspnea (frequency of 7.1%), chest discomfort (frequency of 9.5%), chest pain (frequency of 9.5%), erythema (frequency of 9.5%), and pruritus (frequency of 9.5%). These manifestations overlap with the symptoms of anaphylaxis, but in a given patient did not occur together to satisfy the clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis. Infusion reactions are thought to result from release of various mediators, such as cytokines. Infusion reactions occurred at any time during a course of treatment with approximately 3% occurring with the first infusion, and approximately 91% occurred during the time of infusion. KRYSTEXXA should be administered in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage infusion reactions. Patients should be pre-treated with antihistamines and corticosteroids. KRYSTEXXA should be infused slowly over no less than 120 minutes. In the event of an infusion reaction, the infusion should be slowed, or stopped and restarted at a slower rate. The risk of infusion reaction is higher in patients whose uric acid level increases to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to infusions and discontinue treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL. Because of the possibility that concomitant use of oral urate-lowering therapy and KRYSTEXXA may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels, it is recommended that before starting KRYSTEXXA patients discontinue oral urate-lowering medications and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering agents while taking KRYSTEXXA. 5.3\tG6PD Deficiency Associated Hemolysis and Methemoglobinemia Life threatening hemolytic reactions and methemoglobinemia have been reported with KRYSTEXXA in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Because of the risk of hemolysis and methemoglobinemia, do not administer KRYSTEXXA to patients with G6PD deficiency [see . Screen patients at risk for G6PD deficiency prior to starting KRYSTEXXA. For example, patients of African, Mediterranean (including Southern European and Middle Eastern), and Southern Asian ancestry are at increased risk for G6PD deficiency. Contraindications (4) ] 5.4\tGout Flares In a 52-week, randomized, double-blind trial which evaluated KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate compared to KRYSTEXXA alone, patients were administered gout flare prophylaxis similar to that in the pre-marketing, placebo-controlled trials. In this trial, the percentages of patients with any flare for the first 3 months were 66% and 69% for the group treated with KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate and the group treated with KRYSTEXXA alone, respectively. In the group treated with KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate, the percentages of patients with any flare for the subsequent 3 month increments of treatment were 27% during Month 6, 8% during Month 9 and 9% during Month 12. In the group treated with KRYSTEXXA alone, the percentages of patients with any flare were 14% during Month 6, 9% during Month 9 and 21% during Month 12. During pre-marketing, 24-week controlled clinical trials with KRYSTEXXA alone, the frequencies of gout flares were high in all treatment groups, but more so with KRYSTEXXA treatment during the first 3 months of treatment, and decreased in the subsequent 3 months of treatment. The percentages of patients with any flare for the first 3 months were 74%, 81%, and 51%, for KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, and placebo, respectively. The percentages of patients with any flare for the subsequent 3 months were 41%, 57%, and 67%, for KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks, KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 4 weeks, and placebo, respectively. Patients received gout flare prophylaxis with colchicine and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) starting at least one week before receiving KRYSTEXXA. Gout flares may occur after initiation of KRYSTEXXA. An increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon initiation of anti-hyperuricemic therapy, due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Gout flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended starting at least 1 week before initiation of KRYSTEXXA therapy and lasting at least 6 months, unless medically contraindicated or not tolerated. KRYSTEXXA does not need to be discontinued because of a gout flare. The gout flare should be managed concurrently as appropriate for the individual patient [see . Dosage and Administration (2) ] 5.5\tCongestive Heart Failure KRYSTEXXA has not been formally studied in patients with congestive heart failure, but some patients in the pre-marketing, 24-week controlled clinical trials experienced exacerbation of congestive heart failure. Two cases of congestive heart failure exacerbation occurred during the trials in patients receiving treatment with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks. No cases were reported in placebo-treated patients. Four subjects had exacerbations of pre-existing congestive heart failure while receiving KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks during the open-label extension study. Exercise caution when using KRYSTEXXA in patients who have congestive heart failure and monitor patients closely following infusion. 5.6\tRe-treatment with KRYSTEXXA No controlled trial data are available on the safety and efficacy of re-treatment with KRYSTEXXA after stopping treatment for longer than 4 weeks. Due to the immunogenicity of KRYSTEXXA, patients receiving re-treatment may be at increased risk of anaphylaxis and infusion reactions. Therefore, patients receiving re-treatment after a drug-free interval should be monitored carefully [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]",

Co-administration with Methotrexate A 52-week, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted in adult patients with chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy to evaluate administration of KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks co-administered with weekly administration of oral methotrexate 15 mg, compared to KRYSTEXXA alone. In this trial, patients who were able to tolerate two weeks on methotrexate 15 mg were then randomized to receive four additional weeks on either methotrexate 15 mg or matching placebo prior to initiating KRYSTEXXA therapy. A total of 152 subjects were randomized, and of these, 145 subjects completed the 4-week methotrexate run-in period and received KRYSTEXXA (96 subjects received KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate and 49 received KRYSTEXXA plus placebo) during the treatment period. All patients received pre-treatment with an oral antihistamine, intravenous corticosteroid and acetaminophen. These patients were between the ages of 24 and 83 years (average 55 years); 135 patients were male and 17 and were female; 105 patients were White/Caucasian, 22 were Black/African American, 14 were Asian, 5 were Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and 5 identified as Other; 28 were Hispanic or Latino. Common co-morbid conditions among the enrolled patients included hypertension (63%), osteoarthritis (25%), hyperlipidemia (24%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (22%), obesity (20%), type 2 diabetes (18%) and depression (16%). Patients with an eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were excluded from this trial. The most commonly reported adverse reaction during the methotrexate pre-treatment periods was gout flare. The most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 5% in either treatment group during the KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate or KRYSTEXXA alone period are provided in Table 1. Table 1.

These patients were between the ages of 23 and 89 years (average 55 years); 173 patients were male and 39 were female; and 143 patients were White/Caucasian, 27 were Black/African American, 24 were Hispanic/Latino and 18 were all other ethnicities. Common co-morbid conditions among the enrolled patients included hypertension (72%), dyslipidemia (49%), chronic kidney disease (28%), diabetes (24%), coronary artery disease (18%), arrhythmia (16%), and cardiac failure/left ventricular dysfunction (12%). During the pre-marketing placebo-controlled clinical trials, the most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA 8 mg every 2 weeks are provided in Table 2.

The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors including assay sensitivity and specificity and assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the comparison of the incidence of antibodies to pegloticase with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In a 52-week, randomized, double-blind trial which evaluated KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate compared to KRYSTEXXA alone, approximately 26% of patients had pre-existing antibodies to pegloticase. Patients with an increase in titer from baseline or who were negative at baseline and developed an anti-pegloticase response at one or more post dose time points was 30% and 51%, for the KRYSTEXXA co-administered with methotrexate and KRYSTEXXA alone treatment groups, respectively. Patients with higher antibody titers were more likely to have faster clearance and lower efficacy. During pre-marketing 24-week controlled clinical trials with KRYSTEXXA alone, anti-pegloticase antibodies developed in 92% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks, and 28% for placebo. Anti-PEG antibodies were also detected in 42% of patients treated with KRYSTEXXA. High anti-pegloticase antibody titer was associated with a failure to maintain pegloticase-induced normalization of uric acid. The impact of anti-PEG antibodies on patients' responses to other PEG-containing therapeutics is unknown. There was a higher incidence of infusion reactions in patients with high anti-pegloticase antibody titer: 53% (16 of 30) in the KRYSTEXXA every 2 weeks group compared to 6% in patients who had undetectable or low antibody titers. 6.3\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of KRYSTEXXA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship. General disorders and administration site conditions : asthenia, malaise, peripheral swelling",
