    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome : Increased risk when coadministered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If it occurs, discontinue TRINTELLIX and serotonergic agents and initiate supportive measures ( 5.2 ) . Increased Risk of Bleeding : Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation may increase risk ( 5.3 ) . Activation of Mania/Hypomania : Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.4 ) . Angle Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants ( 5.6 ) . Hyponatremia : Can occur in association with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) ( 5.7 ) . Sexual Dysfunction: TRINTELLIX may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction ( 5.8 ) . 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs ( SSRIs and other antidepressant classes ) that included approximately 77.000 adult patients and 4.500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1.000 patients treated are provided in Table 1 . Table 1: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric TRINTELLIX is not approved for use in pediatric patients. and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18 to 24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 years old 1 fewer patient \u226565 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e. , beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for all approved populations for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing TRINTELLIX, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts and behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonergic antidepressants, including TRINTELLIX, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs ( including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, meperidine, methadone, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort ) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. , MAOIs [see . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes ( e.g. , agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma ) , autonomic instability ( e.g. , tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular symptoms ( e.g. , tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination ) , seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms ( e.g. , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ) . The concomitant use of TRINTELLIX with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate TRINTELLIX in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes ( such as oral tablets or local tissue injection ) . If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking TRINTELLIX, discontinue TRINTELLIX before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] Monitor all patients taking TRINTELLIX for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with TRINTELLIX and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of TRINTELLIX with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Increased Risk of Bleeding The use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including TRINTELLIX, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies ( case-control and cohort design ) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs or SNRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see . Bleeding events related to drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding when TRINTELLIX is coadministered with NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing TRINTELLIX [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] 5.4 Activation of Mania/Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with TRINTELLIX or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. Symptoms of mania/hypomania were reported in <0.1% of patients treated with TRINTELLIX in premarketing clinical studies. Prior to initiating treatment with TRINTELLIX, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.5. Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions have been reported upon abrupt discontinuation of treatment with TRINTELLIX at doses of 15 mg/day and 20 mg/day [see . A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] . Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances ( e.g. , paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations ) , tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. 5.6 Angle Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including TRINTELLIX, may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. 5.7 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia has occurred as a result of treatment with serotonergic drugs, including TRINTELLIX. In many cases, hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( SIADH ) . One case with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L was reported in a subject treated with TRINTELLIX in a premarketing clinical study. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with a serotonergic antidepressant. Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume-depleted can be at greater risk. Discontinuation of TRINTELLIX in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. More severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. 5.8 Sexual Dysfunction Use of serotonergic antidepressants, including TRINTELLIX, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see . In male patients, serotonergic antidepressant use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of TRINTELLIX and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history ( including timing of symptom onset ) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Increased Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Activation of Mania/Hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Discontinuation Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Angle Closure Glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence \u22655% and at least twice the rate of placebo ) were: nausea, constipation and vomiting ( 6 ) . To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. at 1-877-TAKEDA-7 ( 1-877-825-3327 ) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Patient Exposure TRINTELLIX was evaluated for safety in 5.852 patients ( 18 years to 88 years of age ) diagnosed with MDD who participated in pre- and postmarketing clinical studies; 2.616 of those patients were exposed to TRINTELLIX in 6 to 8 week, placebo-controlled studies at doses ranging from 5 mg to 20 mg once daily; 204 patients were exposed to TRINTELLIX in a 24 to 64 week placebo-controlled maintenance study at doses of 5 mg to 10 mg once daily; and 429 patients were exposed to TRINTELLIX in a 32 week placebo-controlled maintenance study in the U.S. at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg, once daily. Patients from the 6 to 8 week studies continued into 12-month open-label studies. A total of 2.586 patients were exposed to at least one dose of TRINTELLIX in open-label studies, 1.727 were exposed to TRINTELLIX for 6 months and 885 were exposed for at least 1 year. Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment In pooled 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies the incidence of patients who received TRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, and 20 mg/day and discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction was 5% , 6% , 8% , and 8% , respectively, compared to 4% of placebo-treated patients. Nausea was the most common adverse reaction reported as a reason for discontinuation. Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled MDD Studies The most commonly observed adverse reactions in MDD patients treated with TRINTELLIX in 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies ( incidence \u22655% and at least twice the rate of placebo ) were nausea, constipation and vomiting. Table 2 shows the incidence of common adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of MDD patients treated with any TRINTELLIX dose and at least 2% more frequently than in placebo-treated patients in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies.

It was usually considered mild or moderate in intensity and the median duration was two weeks. Nausea was more common in females than males. Nausea most commonly occurred in the first week of TRINTELLIX treatment with 15 to 20% of patients experiencing nausea after one to two days of treatment. Approximately 10% of patients taking TRINTELLIX 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day had nausea at the end of the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. Sexual Dysfunction Difficulties in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of psychiatric disorders or comorbid conditions, but they may also be consequences of pharmacologic treatment, including TRINTELLIX. In addition to the data from the MDD studies mentioned below, TRINTELLIX has been prospectively assessed for its effects in MDD patients with existing TESD induced by prior SSRI treatment and in healthy adults with normal sexual function at baseline [see . Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] Voluntarily Reported Adverse Reactions of Sexual Dysfunction In the MDD 6 to 8 week controlled trials of TRINTELLIX, voluntarily reported adverse reactions related to sexual dysfunction were captured as individual event terms. These event terms have been aggregated and the overall incidence was as follows. In male patients the overall incidence was 3% , 4% , 4% , 5% in TRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 20 mg/day, respectively, compared to 2% in placebo. In female patients, the overall incidence was <1% , 1% , <1% , 2% in TRINTELLIX 5 mg/day, 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 20 mg/day, respectively, compared to <1% in placebo. Adverse Reactions of Sexual Dysfunction in Patients with Normal Sexual Functioning at Baseline Because voluntarily reported adverse sexual reactions are known to be underreported, in part because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them, the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale ( ASEX ) , a validated measure designed to identify sexual side effects, was used prospectively in seven placebo-controlled trials. The ASEX scale includes five questions that pertain to the following aspects of sexual function: 1 ) sex drive, 2 ) ease of arousal, 3 ) ability to achieve erection ( men ) or lubrication ( women ) , 4 ) ease of reaching orgasm, and 5 ) orgasm satisfaction. The presence or absence of sexual dysfunction among patients entering clinical studies was based on their self-reported ASEX scores. For patients without sexual dysfunction at baseline ( approximately 1/3 of the population across all treatment groups in each study ) , Table 3 shows the incidence of patients that developed TESD when treated with TRINTELLIX or placebo in any fixed dose group. Physicians should routinely inquire about possible sexual side effects. Table 3: ASEX Incidence of Treatment Emergent Sexual Dysfunction Incidence based on number of subjects with sexual dysfunction during the study/number of subjects without sexual dysfunction at baseline. Sexual dysfunction was defined as a subject scoring any of the following on the ASEX scale at two consecutive visits during the study: 1 ) total score \u226519; 2 ) any single item \u22655; 3 ) three or more items each with a score \u22654 TRINTELLIX 5 mg/day N=65:67 Sample size for each dose group is the number of patients ( females:males ) without sexual dysfunction at baseline TRINTELLIX 10 mg/day N=94:86 TRINTELLIX 15 mg/day N=57:67 TRINTELLIX 20 mg/day N=67:59 Placebo N=135:162 Females 22% 23% 33% 34% 20% Males 16% 20% 19% 29% 14% Adverse Reactions Following Abrupt Discontinuation of TRINTELLIX Treatment Discontinuation symptoms have been prospectively evaluated in patients taking TRINTELLIX 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, and 20 mg/day using the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms ( DESS ) scale in clinical trials. Some patients experienced discontinuation symptoms such as headache, muscle tension, mood swings, sudden outbursts of anger, dizziness, and runny nose in the first week of abrupt discontinuation of TRINTELLIX 15 mg/day and 20 mg/day. Laboratory Tests TRINTELLIX has not been associated with any clinically important changes in laboratory test parameters in serum chemistry ( except sodium ) , hematology and urinalysis as measured in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. Hyponatremia has been reported with the treatment of TRINTELLIX [see . In the 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of a long-term study in patients who had responded to TRINTELLIX during the initial 12 week, open-label phase, there were no clinically important changes in lab test parameters between TRINTELLIX and placebo-treated patients. Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] Weight TRINTELLIX had no significant effect on body weight as measured by the mean change from baseline in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies. In the six month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of a long-term study in patients who had responded to TRINTELLIX during the initial 12-week, open-label phase, there was no significant effect on body weight between TRINTELLIX and placebo-treated patients. Vital Signs TRINTELLIX has not been associated with any clinically significant effects on vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, as measured in placebo-controlled studies. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies The following listing does not include reactions: 1 ) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2 ) for which a drug cause was remote, 3 ) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4 ) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5 ) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.
