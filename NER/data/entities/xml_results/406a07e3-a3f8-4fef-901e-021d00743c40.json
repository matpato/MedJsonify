( 5.13 ) \u2022 Rapid Offset of Action : Standard monitoring should be maintained in the postoperative period to ensure adequate recovery without stimulation. ( 5.14 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse Remifentanil HCl contains remifentanil, a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, remifentanil HCl exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 )]. Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion. Consider these risks when handling remifentanil HCl. Strategies to reduce these risks include proper product storage and control practices for a C-II drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product. 5.2 Respiratory Depression in Spontaneously Breathing Patients Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Remifentanil HCl should be administered only by persons specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, including respiration and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated. Such training must include the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation. Resuscitative and intubation equipment, oxygen, and opioid antagonists must be readily available. Respiratory depression in spontaneously breathing patients is generally managed by decreasing the rate of the infusion of remifentanil HCl by 50% or by temporarily discontinuing the infusion [see Overdosage ( . 10 )] Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects  of opioids. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of remifentanil HCl, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially when initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of remifentanil HCl. Remifentanil HCl should not be used in diagnostic or therapeutic procedures outside the monitored anesthesia care setting. Patients receiving monitored anesthesia care should be continuously monitored by persons not involved in the conduct of the surgical or diagnostic procedure. Oxygen saturation should be monitored on a continuous basis. Patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of remifentanil HCl. Elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients resulting in greater risk for respiratory depression. Monitor such patients closely including vital signs, particularly when initiating and titrating remifentanil HCl and when remifentanil HCl is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of remifentanil HCl are essential [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.11 )] 5.3 Risks from Use as Postoperative Analgesia with Concomitant Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Hypotension, profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of remifentanil HCl with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, or alcohol). Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol for 24 hours after surgery [see Drug Interactions ( . 7 )] 5.4 Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of remifentanil HCl with serotonergic drugs. Serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAO inhibitors, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) [see Drug Interactions ( . This may occur within the recommended dosage range. 7 )] Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination, rigidity), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue remifentanil HCl if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 5.5 Administration Continuous infusions of remifentanil HCl should be administered only by an infusion device. IV bolus administration of remifentanil HCl should be used only during the maintenance of general anesthesia. In nonintubated patients, single doses of remifentanil HCl should be administered over 30 to 60 seconds. Interruption of an infusion of remifentanil HCl will result in rapid offset of effect. Rapid clearance and lack of drug accumulation result in rapid dissipation of respiratory depressant and analgesic effects upon discontinuation of remifentanil HCl at recommended doses. Discontinuation of an infusion of remifentanil HCl should be preceded by the establishment of adequate postoperative analgesia. Injections of remifentanil HCl should be made into IV tubing at or close to the venous cannula. Upon discontinuation of remifentanil HCl, the IV tubing should be cleared to prevent the inadvertent administration of remifentanil HCl at a later point in time. Failure to adequately clear the IV tubing to remove residual remifentanil HCl has been associated with the appearance of respiratory depression, apnea, and muscle rigidity upon the administration of additional fluids or medications through the same IV tubing. 5.6 Skeletal Muscle Rigidity Skeletal muscle rigidity can be caused by remifentanil HCl and is related to the dose and speed of administration. Remifentanil HCl may cause chest wall rigidity (inability to ventilate) after single doses of > 1 mcg/kg administered over 30 to 60 seconds, or after infusion rates > 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Single doses < 1 mcg/kg may cause chest wall rigidity when given concurrently with a continuous infusion of remifentanil HCl. Muscle rigidity induced by remifentanil HCl should be managed in the context of the patient's clinical condition. Muscle rigidity occurring during the induction of anesthesia should be treated by the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent and the concurrent induction medications and can be treated by decreasing the rate or discontinuing the infusion of remifentanil HCl or by administering a neuromuscular blocking agent. The neuromuscular blocking agents used should be compatible with the patient's cardiovascular status. Muscle rigidity seen during the use of remifentanil HCl in spontaneously breathing patients may be treated by stopping or decreasing the rate of administration of remifentanil HCl. Resolution of muscle rigidity after discontinuing the infusion of remifentanil HCl occurs within minutes. In the case of life-threatening muscle rigidity, a rapid onset neuromuscular blocker or naloxone may be administered. 5.7 Potential Inactivation by Nonspecific Esterases in Blood Products Remifentanil HCl should not be administered into the same IV tubing with blood due to potential inactivation by nonspecific esterases in blood products. 5.8 Bradycardia Bradycardia has been reported with remifentanil HCl and is responsive to ephedrine or anticholinergic drugs, such as atropine and glycopyrrolate. 5.9 Hypotension Hypotension has been reported with remifentanil HCl and is responsive to decreases in the administration of remifentanil HCl or to IV fluids or catecholamine (ephedrine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, etc.) administration. 5.10 Intraoperative Awareness Intraoperative awareness has been reported in patients under 55 years of age when remifentanil HCL has been administered with propofol infusion rates of \u2264 75 mcg/kg/min. 5.11 Risks of Use in Spontaneously Breathing Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO 2 retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), remifentanil HCl may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO 2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure in spontaneously breathing patients. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with remifentanil HCl. Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. 5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Biliary Tract Disease The remifentanil in remifentanil HCl may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms. 5.13 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders The remifentanil in remifentanil HCl may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during remifentanil HCl therapy. 5.14 Rapid Offset of Action Analgesic activity will subside within 5 to 10 minutes after discontinuation of administration of remifentanil HCl. However, respiratory depression may continue in some patients for up to 30 minutes after termination of infusion due to residual effects of concomitant anesthetics. Standard monitoring should be maintained in the postoperative period to ensure adequate recovery without stimulation. For patients undergoing surgical procedures where postoperative pain is generally anticipated, other analgesics should be administered prior to the discontinuation of remifentanil HCl.",

Pediatrics Remifentanil HCl has been studied in 342 pediatric patients in controlled clinical studies for maintenance of general anesthesia. In the pediatric population (birth to 12 years), the most commonly reported events were nausea, vomiting, and shivering. The frequencies of adverse events during general anesthesia with the recommended doses of remifentanil HCl are given in Table 17. Each patient was counted once for each type of adverse event. There were no adverse events \u2265 1% for any treatment group during the maintenance period in the pediatric patient general anesthesia studies.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular : Asystole Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in remifentanil HCl.",
