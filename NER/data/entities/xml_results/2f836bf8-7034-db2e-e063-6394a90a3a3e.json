Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2859 patients with overactive\u00a0bladder, of which 2288 were treated with fesoterodine. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 785\u00a0received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8- or 12-weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had\u00a0greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in these trials. A total of 1964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies\u00a0combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release\u00a0tablets 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release\u00a0tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were\u00a0judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release\u00a0tablets who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was dry mouth. The incidence of dry\u00a0mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%,\u00a00.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets\u00a08 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking\u00a04 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater\u00a0than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12-weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for at least\u00a06 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the\u00a012-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most\u00a0adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study\u00a0medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases),\u00a0diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases). Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 131 pediatric patients with NDO. Patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily in two clinical trials (Studies 3 and 4). Study 3 was a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with NDO from 6 years to 17 years of age and weighing greater than 25 kg. This study consisted of a 12-week efficacy phase, in which 84 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, followed by a 12-week safety extension phase, in which 103 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of the 103 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase, 67 continued fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets from the efficacy phase and 36 switched from an active comparator in the efficacy phase to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase. Study 4 (N=11) was an 8-week, Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study in pediatric patients with NDO from 8 years to 17 years of age. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased and headache. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than or equal to 2% in either treatment group in the Study 3 efficacy phase.

The ophthalmological adverse reactions did not result in discontinuation of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets\u00a0in any patient. Increases in Heart Rate Increases in heart rate were reported in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets\u00a08 mg in Study 3. The mean heart data are described in Table 6.

The proportion of patients with heart rates greater than the 99 th percentile for age also increased from baseline in patients who received fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets\u00a08 mg in Study 3. These data are described in Table 7. Table 7: Proportion of Pediatric Patients With Heart Rate Greater Than the 99 th Percentile for Age and Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 Study visit Proportion of patients with heart rate >99th percentile for age Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg Baseline 2.4% 2.4% Week 4 8.1% 12.2% Week 12 \u204e 7.5% 11.5% Week 24 3.3% 2.7% * Week 12 comprises patients who received fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets for 12 weeks after being originally randomized to fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg and patients originally randomized to active comparator and subsequently transitioned to fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg for 12 weeks. Increases from baseline in the proportion of patients with a heart rate greater than the 99 th percentile for age were most pronounced in patients less than 12 years of age who received fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg.\u00a0Increases in heart rate in patients who received fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 were not associated with clinical symptoms and did not result in discontinuation of therapy with fesoterodine\u00a0fumarate extended-release tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Because these reactions\u00a0are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to\u00a0drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations Central nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders: Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and\u00a0subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, pruritus",
