    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS CYP2 C19 inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole. ( 5.1 ) Bleeding: Clopidogrel increases risk of bleeding. ( 5.2 ) Discontinuation: Premature discontinuation increases risk of cardiovascular events. Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. ( 5.3 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Cross-reactivity among thienopyridines has been reported. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity in Patients with Impaired CYP2 C19 Function Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2 C19 [see . Boxed Warning ] The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2 C19, such as omeprazole or esomeprazole. Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) ] 5.2 General Risk of Bleeding P2 Y12 inhibitors ( thienopyridines ) , including clopidogrel, increase the risk of bleeding. P2 Y12 inhibitors ( thienopyridines ) , inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet ( 7 to 10 days ) . Because the half-life of clopidogrel\u2019s active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective. Use of drugs that induce the activity of CYP2 C19 would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and might potentiate the bleeding risk. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2 C19 inducers [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] Risk factors for bleeding include concomitant use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding ( e.g. , anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and chronic use of NSAIDs ) [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.4 , 7.5 , 7.6 , 7.7 ) ] 5.3 Discontinuation of Clopidogrel Discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the risk of cardiovascular events. If clopidogrel must be temporarily discontinued ( e.g. , to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding ) , restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with clopidogrel for five days prior to such surgery. Resume clopidogrel as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( TTP ) TTP, sometimes fatal, has been reported following use of clopidogrel, sometimes after a short exposure ( <2 weeks ) . TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis ( plasma exchange ) . It is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ( schistocytes [fragmented RBCs] seen on peripheral smear ) , neurological findings, renal dysfunction, and fever [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] . 5.5 Cross-Reactivity among Thienopyridines Hypersensitivity including rash, angioedema or hematologic reaction has been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel, including patients with a history of hypersensitivity or hematologic reaction to other thienopyridines [see . Contraindications ( 4.2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ]",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Bleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding, is the most commonly reported adverse reaction. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow-up, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 54.000 patients, including over 21.000 patients treated for one year or more. The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing clopidogrel plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing clopidogrel alone to aspirin alone are discussed below. Bleeding CURE In CURE, clopidogrel use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding ( primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites ) compared to placebo with aspirin ( see Table 1 ) . The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage ( 0.1% ) and fatal bleeding ( 0.2% ) were the same in both groups. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis, hematuria, and bruise. The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1. Table 1: CURE Incidence of Bleeding Complications ( % patients ) Event Clopidogrel ( + aspirin ) ( n=6259 ) Placebo ( + aspirin ) ( n=6303 ) * Life-threatening and other major bleeding. \u2020 Led to interruption of study medication.

Table 2: Incidence of Bleeding Events in COMMIT ( % patients ) Type of Bleeding Clopidogrel ( + aspirin ) ( n=22961 ) Placebo ( + aspirin ) ( n=22891 ) p-value * Major bleeds were cerebral bleeds or noncerebral bleeds thought to have caused death or that required transfusion.

The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0.4% for clopidogrel compared to 0.5% for aspirin. Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis and hematoma. Other Adverse Events In CURE and CHARISMA, which compared clopidogrel plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was no difference in the rate of adverse events ( other than bleeding ) between clopidogrel and placebo. In CAPRIE, which compared clopidogrel to aspirin, pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking clopidogrel. No other difference in the rate of adverse events ( other than bleeding ) was reported. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of clopidogrel. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hemorrhages, including those with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with clopidogrel.
