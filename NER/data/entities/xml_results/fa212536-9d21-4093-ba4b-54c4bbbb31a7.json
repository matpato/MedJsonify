BREVIBLOC injection is also indicated in noncompensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician\u2019s judgment, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. BREVIBLOC injection is intended for short-term use. 1.2 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension BREVIBLOC ( Esmolol Hydrochloride ) injection is indicated for the short-term treatment of tachycardia and hypertension that occur during induction and tracheal intubation, during surgery, on emergence from anesthesia and in the postoperative period, when in the physician\u2019s judgment such specific intervention is considered indicated. Use of BREVIBLOC injection to prevent such events is not recommended.",

    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac failure: Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular adverse effects. Reduce or discontinue use ( 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.10 ) \u2022 Risk of exacerbating reactive airway disease ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Diabetes: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia and alter glucose levels; monitor ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Risk of unopposed alpha-agonism and severe hypertension in untreated pheochromocytoma ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of myocardial ischemia when abruptly discontinued in patients with coronary artery disease ( 5.12 , 5.15 ) 5.1 Hypotension Hypotension can occur at any dose but is dose-related. Patients with hemodynamic compromise or on interacting medications are at particular risk. Severe reactions may include loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, and death. For control of ventricular heart rate, maintenance doses greater than 200 mcg per kg per min are not recommended. Monitor patients closely, especially if pretreatment blood pressure is low. In case of an unacceptable drop in blood pressure, reduce or stop BREVIBLOC injection. Decrease of dose or termination of infusion reverses hypotension, usually within 30 minutes. 5.2 Bradycardia Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, severe bradycardia, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of BREVIBLOC injection. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving BREVIBLOC injection [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop BREVIBLOC injection. 5.3 Cardiac Failure Beta blockers, like BREVIBLOC injection, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, stop BREVIBLOC injection and start supportive therapy [see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] . 5.4 Intraoperative and Postoperative Tachycardia and/or Hypertension Monitor vital signs closely and titrate BREVIBLOC injection slowly in the treatment of patients whose blood pressure is primarily driven by vasoconstriction associated with hypothermia. 5.5 Reactive Airways Disease Patients with reactive airways disease should, in general, not receive beta blockers. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity and titratability, titrate BREVIBLOC injection to the lowest possible effective dose. In the event of bronchospasm, stop the infusion immediately; a beta 2 stimulating agent may be administered with appropriate monitoring of ventricular rates. 5.6 Hypoglycemia Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting ( i.e. , surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting ) . If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment. 5.7 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions have occurred with the use of BREVIBLOC injection. They include irritation, inflammation, and severe reactions ( thrombophlebitis, necrosis, and blistering ) , in particular when associated with extravasation [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] . Avoid infusions into small veins or through a butterfly catheter. If a local infusion site reaction develops, use an alternative infusion site and avoid extravasation. 5.8 Use in Patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s Angina Beta blockers may exacerbate anginal attacks in patients with Prinzmetal\u2019s angina because of unopposed alpha receptor\u2013mediated coronary artery vasoconstriction. Do not use nonselective beta blockers. 5.9 Use in Patients with Pheochromocytoma If BREVIBLOC injection is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, give it in combination with an alpha-blocker, and only after the alpha-blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure from the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle. 5.10 Use in Hypovolemic Patients In hypovolemic patients, BREVIBLOC injection can attenuate reflex tachycardia and increase the risk of hypotension. 5.11 Use in Patients with Peripheral Circulatory Disorders In patients with peripheral circulatory disorders ( including Raynaud\u2019s disease or syndrome, and peripheral occlusive vascular disease ) , BREVIBLOC injection may aggravate peripheral circulatory disorders. 5.12 Abrupt Discontinuation of BREVIBLOC Injection Severe exacerbations of angina, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease upon abrupt discontinuation of beta blocker therapy. Observe patients for signs of myocardial ischemia when discontinuing BREVIBLOC injection. Heart rate increases moderately above pretreatment levels 30 minutes after BREVIBLOC injection discontinuation. 5.13 Hyperkalemia Beta blockers, including BREVIBLOC injection, have been associated with increases in serum potassium levels and hyperkalemia. The risk is increased in patients with risk factors such as renal impairment. Intravenous administration of beta blockers has been reported to cause potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia in hemodialysis patients. Monitor serum electrolytes during therapy with BREVIBLOC injection. 5.14 Use in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis Beta blockers, including BREVIBLOC injection, have been reported to cause hyperkalemic renal tubular acidosis. Acidosis in general may be associated with reduced cardiac contractility. 5.15 Use in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs ( e.g. , tachycardia ) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, monitor patients for signs of thyrotoxicosis when withdrawing beta blocking therapy. 5.16 Use in Patients at Risk of Severe Acute Hypersensitivity Reactions When using beta blockers, patients at risk of anaphylactic reactions may be more reactive to allergen exposure ( accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic ) . Patients using beta blockers may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( incidence >10% ) are symptomatic hypotension ( hyperhidrosis, dizziness ) and asymptomatic hypotension ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Baxter Healthcare Corporation at 1-866-888-2472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reaction rates are based on use of BREVIBLOC ( Esmolol Hydrochloride ) injection in clinical trials involving 369 patients with supraventricular tachycardia and over 600 intraoperative and postoperative patients enrolled in clinical trials. Most adverse effects observed in controlled clinical trial settings have been mild and transient. The most important and common adverse effect has been hypotension [see Deaths have been reported in post-marketing experience occurring during complex clinical states where BREVIBLOC injection was presumably being used simply to control ventricular rate Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] .
