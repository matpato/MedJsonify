    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Fatal liver failure has been observed. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, during each cycle, and as clinically indicated. Interrupt sunitinib malate for Grade 3 hepatotoxicity until resolution to Grade \u22641 or baseline and resume sunitinib malate at a reduced dose; discontinue if no resolution. Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients with Grade 4 hepatoxicity, in patients who have subsequent severe changes in liver function tests or other signs and symptoms of liver failure. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) Cardiovascular Events : Myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit of normal including death have occurred. Monitor for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure and consider monitoring LVEF at baseline and periodically during treatment. Discontinue sunitinib malate for clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure. Interrupt and/or dose reduce for decreased LVEF. ( 5.2 ) QT Interval Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : Monitor patients at higher risk for developing QT interval prolongation. Consider monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes. ( 5.3 ) Hypertension : Monitor blood pressure at baseline and as clinically indicated. Initiate and/or adjust antihypertensive therapy as appropriate. Interrupt sunitinib malate for Grade 3 hypertension until resolution to Grade \u22641 or baseline, then resume sunitinib malate at a reduced dose. Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients who develop Grade 4 hypertension. ( 5.4 ) Hemorrhagic Events : Tumor-related hemorrhage and viscus perforation (both with fatal events) have occurred. Perform serial complete blood counts and physical examinations. Interrupt sunitinib malate for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhagic events until resolution to Grade \u22641 or baseline, then resume at a reduced dose; discontinue if no resolution. ( 5.5 ) Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) : TLS (some fatal) has been reported primarily in patients with RCC and GIST. Monitor these patients and treat as clinically indicated. ( 5.6 ) Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) : TMA, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, sometimes leading to renal failure or a fatal outcome, has been reported. Discontinue sunitinib malate for TMA. ( 5.7 ) Proteinuria : Renal failure or a fatal outcome has occurred. Monitor urine protein. Interrupt treatment for 24-hour urine protein of 3 or more grams. Discontinue for repeat episodes of 24-hour urine protein of 3 or more grams despite dose reductions or nephrotic syndrome. ( 5.8 ) Dermatologic Toxicities : Necrotizing fasciitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (some fatal) have occurred. Discontinue sunitinib\u00a0malate for these events. ( 5.9 ) Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) : RPLS (some fatal) has been reported. Monitor for signs and symptoms of RPLS. Withhold sunitinib malate until resolution. ( 5.10 ) Thyroid Dysfunction : Monitor thyroid function at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated. Initiate and/or adjust therapy for thyroid dysfunction as appropriate. ( 5.11 ) Hypoglycemia : Check blood glucose levels regularly and assess if antidiabetic drug dose modifications are required. ( 5.12 ) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) : Withhold sunitinib malate for at least 3 weeks prior to invasive dental procedure and for development of ONJ until complete resolution. ( 5.13 ) Impaired Wound Healing : Withhold sunitinib malate for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of sunitinib malate after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.14 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.15 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hepatotoxicity Sunitinib malate can cause severe hepatotoxicity, resulting in liver failure or death.\u00a0In the pooled safety population, liver failure occurred in <1% of patients in clinical trials. Liver failure include jaundiced, elevated transaminases and/or hyperbilirubinemia in conjunction with encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and/or renal failure. Monitor liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and bilirubin) at baseline, during each cycle, and as clinically indicated. Interrupt sunitinib malate for Grade 3 hepatotoxicity until resolution to Grade \u22641 or baseline, then resume sunitinib malate at a reduced dose. Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients with Grade 4 hepatotoxicity, in patients without resolution of Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, in patients who subsequently experience severe changes in liver function tests and in patients who have other signs and symptoms of liver failure. Safety in patients with ALT or AST >2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or with >5 x ULN and liver metastases has not been established. 5.2 Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular events, including heart failure, cardiomyopathy, myocardial ischemia,\u00a0and myocardial infarction, some of which were fatal, have been reported. In pooled safety population, 3% of patients experienced heart failure; 71% of the patients with heart failure were reported as recovered. Fatal cardiac failure was reported in <1% of patients. In the adjuvant treatment of RCC study, 11 patients experienced Grade 2 decreased ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 40% to 50% and a 10% to 19% decrease from baseline). In 3 of these 11 patients, the ejection fractions arm did not return to \u226550% or baseline by the time of last measurement. No patients who received sunitinib malate were diagnosed with CHF. Patients who presented with cardiac events within 12 months prior to sunitinib malate administration, such as myocardial infarction (including severe/unstable angina), coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic CHF, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism were excluded from sunitinib malate clinical studies. Patients with prior anthracycline use or cardiac radiation were also excluded from some studies. It is unknown whether patients with these concomitant conditions may be at a higher risk of developing left ventricular dysfunction. Consider monitoring LVEF at baseline and periodically as clinically indicated. Carefully monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients who experience clinical manifestations of CHF. Interrupt sunitinib malate and/or reduce the dose in patients without clinical evidence of CHF who have an ejection fraction of greater than 20% but less than 50% below baseline or below the lower limit of normal if baseline ejection fraction was not obtained. 5.3 QT Interval Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Sunitinib malate can cause QT interval prolongation in\u00a0a dose-dependent manner, which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de Pointes. Torsade de Pointes was observed in <0.1% of patients. Monitor patients who are at higher risk of developing QT interval prolongation, including patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes (i.e., magnesium, potassium) during treatment with sunitinib malate. Monitor QT interval more frequently when sunitinib malate is concomitantly administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or drugs known to prolong QT interval. Consider dose reducing sunitinib malate [see . Dosage and Administration (2.5) , Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 5.4 Hypertension In\u00a0the pooled safety population, 29% of patients experienced hypertension. Grade 3 hypertension was reported in 7% of patients, and Grade 4 hypertension was reported in 0.2%. Monitor blood pressure at baseline and as clinically indicated. Initiate and/or adjust antihypertensive therapy as appropriate. In cases of Grade 3 hypertension, withhold sunitinib malate until resolution to Grade \u22641 or baseline, then resume sunitinib malate at a reduced dose. Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients with who develop Grade 4 hypertension. 5.5 Hemorrhagic Events and Viscus Perforation Hemorrhagic events, some of which were fatal, have involved the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, tumor, urinary tract, and brain. In the pooled safety population, 30% of patients experienced hemorrhagic events, including Grade 3\u00a0or 4 in 4.2% of patients. Epistaxis was the most common hemorrhagic event and gastrointestinal hemorrhage was the most common Grade\u00a03 to 5 event. Tumor-related hemorrhage was observed in patients treated with sunitinib malate. These events may occur suddenly, and in the case of pulmonary tumors, may present as severe and life-threatening hemoptysis or pulmonary hemorrhage. Pulmonary hemorrhage, some with a fatal outcome, was observed in patients treated with sunitinib malate for metastatic RCC, GIST, and metastatic lung cancer. Sunitinib malate is not approved for use in patients with lung cancer. Serious, sometimes fatal, gastrointestinal complications including gastrointestinal perforation, have been reported in patients with intra-abdominal malignancies treated with sunitinib malate. Include serial complete blood counts (CBCs) and physical examinations with the clinical assessment of hemorrhagic events. Interrupt sunitinib malate for Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhagic events until resolution to Grade \u22641 or baseline, then resume sunitinib malate at a reduced dose. Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients without resolution of Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhagic events. 5.6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), some fatal, occurred\u00a0in clinical trials and has been reported in postmarketing experience, primarily in patients with RCC or GIST. Patients generally at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Monitor these patients for TLS and manage as appropriate. 5.7 Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA), including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic uremic syndrome, sometimes leading\u00a0to renal failure or a fatal outcome, occurred in clinical trials and in postmarketing experience of sunitinib malate as monotherapy and administered in combination with bevacizumab. Sunitinib malate is not approved for use in combination with bevacizumab. Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients developing TMA. Reversal of the effects of TMA has been observed after sunitinib malate was discontinued. 5.8 Proteinuria Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome have been reported. Some\u00a0of these cases have resulted in renal failure and fatal outcomes. Monitor patients for the development or worsening of proteinuria. Perform baseline and periodic urinalyses during treatment, with follow up measurement of 24-hour urine protein as clinically indicated. Interrupt sunitinib malate and dose reduce for 24-hour urine protein of 3 or more grams. Discontinue sunitinib malate for patients with nephrotic syndrome or repeat episodes of 24-hour urine protein of 3 or more grams despite dose reductions. The safety of continued sunitinib malate treatment in patients with moderate to severe proteinuria has not been evaluated. 5.9 Dermatologic Toxicities Severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported, including erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), some of which were fatal. Permanently discontinue sunitinib malate\u00a0for these severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Necrotizing fasciitis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with sunitinib malate, including of the perineum and secondary to fistula formation. Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis. 5.10 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has been reported in <1% of patients, some of which were fatal. Patients can present with hypertension, headache, decreased alertness, altered mental functioning, and visual loss, including cortical blindness. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Discontinue sunitinib malate in patients developing RPLS. 5.11 Thyroid Dysfunction Hyperthyroidism, some followed by hypothyroidism,\u00a0have been reported in clinical trials and through postmarketing experience of sunitinib malate. Monitor thyroid function at baseline, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroiditis, during treatment with sunitinib malate. Initiate and/or adjust therapies for thyroid dysfunction as appropriate. 5.12 Hypoglycemia Sunitinib malate can result in symptomatic hypoglycemia, which may lead to loss of consciousness, or require hospitalization. In the pooled safety population, hypoglycemia occurred in 2% of the patients treated with sunitinib malate. Hypoglycemia has occurred in clinical trials in 2% of the patients treated with sunitinib malate for advanced RCC (Study 3) and GIST (Study 1) (n=577) and in approximately 10% of the patients treated with sunitinib malate for pNET (Study 6) (n=83). For patients being treated with sunitinib malate for pNET, pre-existing abnormalities in glucose homeostasis were not present in all patients who experienced hypoglycemia. Reductions in blood glucose levels may be worse in patients with diabetes. Check blood glucose levels at baseline, regularly during treatment, as clinically indicated and after discontinuation of sunitinib malate. In patients with diabetes, assess if antidiabetic therapies need to be adjusted to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. 5.13 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) occurred in patients treated with sunitinib malate. Concomitant exposure to other risk factors, such as bisphosphonates or dental disease/invasive dental procedures, may increase the risk of ONJ. Perform an oral examination prior to initiation of sunitinib malate and periodically during sunitinib malate therapy. Advise patients regarding good oral hygiene practices. Withhold sunitinib malate treatment for at least 3 weeks prior to scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures,\u00a0if possible. Withhold sunitinib malate for development of ONJ until complete resolution. The safety of resumption of sunitinib malate after resolution of osteonecrosis of the jaw has not been established. 5.14 Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing has been reported in patients\u00a0who received sunitinib malate [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Withhold sunitinib malate for at least 3 weeks prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of sunitinib malate after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. 5.15 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, sunitinib malate can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant woman. Administration of sunitinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity at approximately 5.5 and 0.3 times the combined systemic exposure [combined area under the curve (AUC) of sunitinib plus its active metabolite] in patients administered the recommended daily dose (RDD) of 50 mg, respectively. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with sunitinib malate and for 4 weeks following the final dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]",

The pooled safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to sunitinib malate in 7527 patients with GIST, RCC (advanced and adjuvant), or pNET. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) were fatigue/asthenia, diarrhea, mucositis/stomatitis, nausea, decreased appetite/anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, bleeding events, dysgeusia/altered taste, dyspepsia, and thrombocytopenia. Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor The safety of sunitinib malate was evaluated in Study 1, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which previously treated patients with GIST received sunitinib malate 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (n=202) or placebo (n=102). Median duration of blinded study treatment was 2 cycles for patients on sunitinib malate (mean: 3.0; range: 1 to 9) and 1 cycle (mean; 1.8; range: 1 to 6) for patients on placebo at the time of the interim analysis. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7% of patients in the sunitinib malate arm. Dose reductions occurred in 11% and dose interruptions occurred in 29% of patients who received sunitinib malate. Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions for Study 1. Table 3.

After an interim analysis , the study was unblinded and patients on the placebo arm were given the opportunity to receive open-label sunitinib malate [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . For 241 patients randomized to the sunitinib malate arm, including 139 who received sunitinib malate in both the double-blind and open-label phases, the median duration of sunitinib malate treatment was 6 cycles (mean: 8.5; range: 1 to 44). For the 255 patients who ultimately received open-label sunitinib malate treatment, median duration of treatment was 6 cycles (mean: 7.8; range: 1 to 37) from the time of the unblinding. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 20% of patients who received sunitinib malate. Dosage interruption occurred in 46% and dose reduction occurred in 28% of patients who received sunitinib malate. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in patients who received sunitinib malate in the open-label phase were fatigue (10%), hypertension (8%), asthenia (5%), diarrhea (5%), hand-foot syndrome (5%), nausea (4%), abdominal pain (3%), anorexia (3%), mucositis (2%), vomiting (2%), and hypothyroidism (2%). Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma The safety of sunitinib malate was evaluated in Study 3, a double-blind, active-controlled trial in which previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC received sunitinib malate 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (n=375) or interferon alfa 9 million International Units (MIU) (n=360). The median duration of treatment was 11.1 months (range: 0.4 to 46.1) for sunitinib malate treatment and 4.1 months (range: 0.1 to 45.6) for interferon alfa treatment. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 20% of patients in the sunitinib malate arm. Dose interruptions occurred in 54% and dose reductions occurred in 52% of patients who received sunitinib malate. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions for Study 3. Table 5.

Long-Term Safety in RCC The long-term safety of sunitinib malate in patients with metastatic RCC was analyzed across 9 completed clinical studies conducted in the first-line, bevacizumab-refractory, and cytokine-refractory treatment settings. The analysis included 5739 patients, of whom 807 (14%) were treated for at least 2 years and 365 (6%) for at least 3 years. Prolonged treatment with sunitinib malate did not appear to be associated with new types of adverse reactions. There appeared to be no increase in the yearly incidence of adverse reactions at later time points. Hypothyroidism increased during the second year of treatment with new cases reported up to year 4. Adjuvant Treatment of RCC The safety of sunitinib malate was evaluated in S-TRAC, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients who had undergone nephrectomy for RCC received sunitinib malate 50 mg daily on Schedule 4/2 (n=306) or placebo (n=304). The median duration of treatment was 12.4 months (range: 0.13 to 14.9) for sunitinib malate and 12.4 months (range: 0.03 to 13.7) for placebo. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 28% of patients in the sunitinib malate arm. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in >2% of patients include hand-foot syndrome and fatigue/asthenia. Dosing interruptions occurred in 54% and dose reductions occurred in 46% of patients who received sunitinib malate. Table 7 summarizes the adverse reactions in S-TRAC. Table 7.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: hemorrhage associated with thrombocytopenia*. Gastrointestinal disorders: esophagitis. Hepatobiliary disorders: cholecystitis, particularly acalculous cholecystitis. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema. Infections and infestations: serious infection (with or without neutropenia)*. The infections most commonly observed with sunitinib malate include respiratory, urinary tract, skin infections, and sepsis/septic shock. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: fistula formation, sometimes associated with tumor necrosis and/or regression*; myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure*. Renal and urinary disorders: renal impairment and/or failure*. Respiratory disorders: pulmonary embolism*, pleural effusion*. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: pyoderma gangrenosum, including positive de-challenges. Vascular disorders: arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections*, and rupture*; arterial thromboembolic events*. The most frequent events included cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, and cerebral infarction. General disorders and administration site conditions: impaired wound healing. *including some fatalities",
