    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher rosuvastatin dosage. Asian patients may be at higher risk for myopathy. Discontinue rosuvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing rosuvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM): Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue rosuvastatin if IMNM is suspected. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue rosuvastatin. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Rosuvastatin may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including rosuvastatin. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies),\u00a0 and higher rosuvastatin dosage. Asian patients on rosuvastatin may be at higher risk for myopathy [see The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg daily compared with lower rosuvastatin dosages. Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ]. Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of rosuvastatin with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. rosuvastatin dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see . Niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Discontinue rosuvastatin if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if rosuvastatin is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the rosuvastatin dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports ofimmune-mediated\u00a0necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the sameor a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despitediscontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement withimmunosuppressive\u00a0agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required.Discontinue rosuvastatin if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of rosuvastatin [see In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1.1% of patients taking rosuvastatin versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with rosuvastatin. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including rosuvastatin. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] Consider liver enzyme testing before rosuvastatin initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see . If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue rosuvastatin. Contraindications (4) ] 5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the rosuvastatin clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin or comparator statins, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, consider a dose reduction for patients on rosuvastatin therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing. 5.5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including rosuvastatin. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [see Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.

In the JUPITER study, patients were treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg (n=8,901) or placebo (n=8,901) for a mean duration of 2 years. In JUPITER, there was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c >6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of Patients Treated with Rosuvastatin and > Placebo in the JUPITER Trial Adverse Reactions Placebo N=8,901 % Rosuvastatin 20 mg N=8,901 % Myalgia 6.6 7.6 Arthralgia 3.2 3.8 Constipation 3.0 3.3 Diabetes mellitus 2.3 2.8 Nausea 2.3 2.4 Pediatric Patients with HeFH In a 12-week controlled study in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH with rosuvastatin 5 mg to 20 mg daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14)], elevations in serum CK greater than 10 x ULN were observed more frequently in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared with patients receiving placebo. Four of 130 (3%) patients treated with rosuvastatin (2 treated with 10 mg and 2 treated with 20 mg) had increased CK greater than 10 x ULN, compared to 0 of 46 patients on placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of rosuvastatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood Disorders: thrombocytopenia Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis, jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Musculoskeletal Disorders: arthralgia, rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use Nervous System Disorders: peripheral neuropathy, rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, and confusion) associated with the use of all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). There have been rare reports of new-onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Psychiatric Disorders: depression, sleep disorders (including insomnia and nightmares) Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: gynecomastia Respiratory Disorders: interstitial lung disease Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), lichenoid drug eruption",
