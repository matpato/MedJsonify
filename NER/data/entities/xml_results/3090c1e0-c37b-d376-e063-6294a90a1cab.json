    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Infections \u2013 do not administer TOFIDENCE during an active infection, including localized infections. If a serious infection develops, interrupt TOFIDENCE until the infection is controlled. ( 5.1 ) Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation\u2014use with caution in patients who may be at increased risk. ( 5.2 ) Hepatotoxicity- Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hepatic injury. Modify or discontinue TOFIDENCE if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 2.8 , 5.3 ) Laboratory monitoring\u2014recommended due to potential consequences of treatment-related changes in neutrophils, platelets, lipids, and liver function tests. ( 2.8 , 5.4 ) Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death and serious cutaneous reactions including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) \u2013 discontinue TOFIDENCE, treat promptly, and monitor until reaction resolves ( 5.6 ) Live vaccines\u2014Avoid use with TOFIDENCE. ( 5.9 , 7.3 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, protozoal, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including tocilizumab products. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis [see Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, cryptococcus, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and pneumocystosis were reported with tocilizumab products. Other serious infections, not reported in clinical studies, may also occur (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, listeriosis). Patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids which in addition to rheumatoid arthritis may predispose them to infections. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Do not administer TOFIDENCE in patients with an active infection, including localized infections. The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to initiating TOFIDENCE in patients: with chronic or recurrent infection; who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of serious or an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with TOFIDENCE, as signs and symptoms of acute inflammation may be lessened due to suppression of the acute phase reactants [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) , Adverse Reactions (6.1) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Hold TOFIDENCE if a patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with TOFIDENCE should undergo a prompt and complete diagnostic workup appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and closely monitor the patient. COVID-19 In patients with COVID-19, monitor for signs and symptoms of new infections during and after treatment with TOFIDENCE. There is limited information regarding the use of tocilizumab products in patients with COVID-19 and concomitant active serious infections. The risks and benefits of treatment with TOFIDENCE in COVID-19 patients with other concurrent infections should be considered. Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis risk factors and test for latent infection prior to initiating TOFIDENCE. In patients with COVID-19, testing for latent infection is not necessary prior to initiating treatment with TOFIDENCE. Consider anti-tuberculosis therapy prior to initiation of TOFIDENCE in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis is recommended to aid in the decision whether initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy is appropriate for an individual patient. Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. The incidence of tuberculosis in worldwide clinical development programs is 0.1%. Patients with latent tuberculosis should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating TOFIDENCE. Viral Reactivation Viral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies and cases of herpes zoster exacerbation were observed in clinical studies with tocilizumab. No cases of Hepatitis B reactivation were observed in the trials; however patients who screened positive for hepatitis were excluded. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Perforations Events of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in clinical trials, primarily as complications of diverticulitis in patients treated with tocilizumab. Use TOFIDENCE with caution in patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation. Promptly evaluate patients presenting with fever, new onset abdominal symptoms, and a change in bowel habits for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Serious cases of hepatic injury have been observed in patients taking intravenous tocilizumab products. Some of these cases have resulted in liver transplant or death. Time to onset for cases ranged from months to years after treatment initiation with tocilizumab products. While most cases presented with marked elevations of transaminases (> 5 times ULN), some cases presented with signs or symptoms of liver dysfunction and only mildly elevated transaminases. During randomized controlled studies, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations [see Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations was observed when potentially hepatotoxic drugs (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with tocilizumab. Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.3 , 6.4) ]. For RA and GCA patients, obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) before initiating TOFIDENCE, every 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy for the first 6 months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. It is not recommended to initiate TOFIDENCE treatment in RA or GCA patients with elevated transaminases ALT or AST greater than 1.5\u00d7 ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT or AST greater than 5\u00d7 ULN, discontinue TOFIDENCE. For recommended modifications based upon increase in transaminases [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may have elevated ALT or AST levels. Multi-organ failure with involvement of the liver is recognized as a complication of severe COVID-19. The decision to administer TOFIDENCE should balance the potential benefit of treating COVID-19 against the potential risks of acute treatment with TOFIDENCE. It is not recommended to initiate TOFIDENCE treatment in COVID-19 patients with elevated ALT or AST above 10 \u00d7 ULN. Monitor ALT and AST during treatment. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, such as fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (e.g., ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range, serum total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range), TOFIDENCE treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. TOFIDENCE should only be restarted in patients with another explanation for the liver test abnormalities after normalization of the liver tests. A similar pattern of liver enzyme elevation is noted with tocilizumab products treatment in the PJIA and SJIA populations. Monitor liver test panel at the time of the second administration and thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks for PJIA and every 2 to 4 weeks for SJIA. 5.4 Changes in Laboratory Parameters Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Giant Cell Arteritis and Coronavirus Disease 2019 Neutropenia Treatment with tocilizumab products was associated with a higher incidence of neutropenia. Infections have been uncommonly reported in association with treatment-related neutropenia in long-term extension studies and postmarketing clinical experience. \u2013 It is not recommended to initiate TOFIDENCE treatment in RA and GCA patients with a low neutrophil count, i.e., absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 2000 per mm 3 . In patients who develop an absolute neutrophil count less than 500 per mm 3 treatment is not recommended. \u2013 Monitor neutrophils 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter [see For recommended modifications based on ANC results Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. see Dosage and Administration (2.8) . \u2013 It is not recommended to initiate TOFIDENCE treatment in COVID-19 patients with an ANC less than 1000 per mm 3 . Neutrophils should be monitored. Thrombocytopenia Treatment with tocilizumab products was associated with a reduction in platelet counts. Treatment-related reduction in platelets was not associated with serious bleeding events in clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. \u2013 It is not recommended to initiate TOFIDENCE treatment in RA and GCA patients with a platelet count below 100,000 per mm 3 . In patients who develop a platelet count less than 50,000 per mm 3 treatment is not recommended. \u2013 Monitor platelets 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months thereafter. For recommended modifications based on platelet counts see Dosage and Administration (2.8) . \u2013 In COVID-19 patients with a platelet count less than 50,000 per mm 3 , treatment is not recommended. Platelets should be monitored. Elevated Liver Enzymes Refer to 5.3 Hepatotoxicity. For recommended modifications see Dosage and Administration (2.8) . Lipid Abnormalities Treatment with tocilizumab products was associated with increases in lipid parameters such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and/or HDL cholesterol [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. \u2013 Assess lipid parameters approximately 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of TOFIDENCE therapy. \u2013 Subsequently, manage patients according to clinical guidelines [e.g., National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP)] for the management of hyperlipidemia. Patients with Polyarticular and Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis A similar pattern of liver enzyme elevation, low neutrophil count, low platelet count and lipid elevations is noted with tocilizumab products treatment in the PJIA and SJIA populations. Monitor neutrophils, platelets, ALT and AST at the time of the second administration and thereafter every 4 to 8 weeks for PJIA and every 2 to 4 weeks for SJIA. Monitor lipids as above for approved adult indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. 5.5 Immunosuppression The impact of treatment with tocilizumab products on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were observed in clinical studies [see TOFIDENCE is an immunosuppressant, and treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in association with tocilizumab products and anaphylactic events with a fatal outcome have been reported with intravenous infusion of tocilizumab products. Anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) of patients in the 6-month controlled trials of intravenous tocilizumab and 0.2% (8 out of 4009) of patients in the intravenous all-exposure RA population. In the SJIA controlled trial with intravenous tocilizumab, 1 out of 112 patients (0.9%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. In the PJIA controlled trial with intravenous tocilizumab 0 out of 188 patients (0%) in the tocilizumab all-exposure population experienced hypersensitivity reactions that required treatment discontinuation. Reactions that required treatment discontinuation included generalized erythema, rash, and urticaria. In the postmarketing setting, events of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and death have occurred in patients treated with a range of doses of intravenous tocilizumab products, with or without concomitant therapies. Events have occurred in patients who received premedication. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis events, have occurred both with and without previous hypersensitivity reactions and as early as the first infusion of tocilizumab products [see In addition, serious cutaneous reactions, including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), have been reported in patients with autoinflammatory conditions treated with tocilizumab products. Adverse Reactions (6.6) ]. TOFIDENCE for intravenous use should only be infused by a healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, immediately discontinue TOFIDENCE, treat promptly and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. 5.7 Demyelinating Disorders The impact of treatment with tocilizumab products on demyelinating disorders is not known, but multiple sclerosis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy were reported rarely in RA clinical studies. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms potentially indicative of demyelinating disorders. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of TOFIDENCE in patients with preexisting or recent onset demyelinating disorders. 5.8 Active Hepatic Disease and Hepatic Impairment Treatment with TOFIDENCE is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic impairment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 5.9 Vaccinations Avoid use of live vaccines concurrently with TOFIDENCE as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving tocilizumab products. No data are available on the effectiveness of vaccination in patients receiving tocilizumab products. Because IL-6 inhibition may interfere with the normal immune response to new antigens, it is recommended that all patients, particularly pediatric or elderly patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating TOFIDENCE therapy. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of TOFIDENCE therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive agents.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Serious Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Gastrointestinal Perforations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Laboratory Parameters [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Immunosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions, Including Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Demyelinating Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Active Hepatic Disease and Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not predict the rates observed in a broader patient population in clinical practice. Most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5%): upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension, increased ALT.

In these studies, patients received doses of tocilizumab-IV 8 mg per kg monotherapy (288 patients), tocilizumab-IV 8 mg per kg in combination with DMARDs (including methotrexate) (1582 patients), or tocilizumab-IV 4 mg per kg in combination with methotrexate (774 patients). The all exposure population includes all patients in registration studies who received at least one dose of tocilizumab-IV. Of the 4009 patients in this population, 3577 received treatment for at least 6 months, 3309 for at least one year; 2954 received treatment for at least 2 years and 2189 for 3 years. All patients in these studies had moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. The study population had a mean age of 52 years, 82% were female and 74% were Caucasian. The most common serious adverse reactions were serious infections [see The most commonly reported adverse reactions in controlled studies up to 24 weeks (occurring in at least 5% of patients treated with tocilizumab-IV monotherapy or in combination with DMARDs) were upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, hypertension and increased ALT. Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions during the double-blind, placebo-controlled studies was 5% for patients taking tocilizumab-IV and 3% for placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that required discontinuation of tocilizumab-IV were increased hepatic transaminase values (per protocol requirement) and serious infections. Overall Infections In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, the rate of infections in the tocilizumab-IV monotherapy group was 119 events per 100 patient-years and was similar in the methotrexate monotherapy group. The rate of infections in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD group was 133 and 127 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 112 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo plus DMARD group. The most commonly reported infections (5% to 8% of patients) were upper respiratory tract infections and nasopharyngitis. The overall rate of infections with tocilizumab-IV in the all exposure population remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. Serious Infections In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab-IV monotherapy group was 3.6 per 100 patient-years compared to 1.5 per 100 patient-years in the methotrexate group. The rate of serious infections in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD group was 4.4 and 5.3 events per 100 patient-years, respectively, compared to 3.9 events per 100 patient-years in the placebo plus DMARD group. In the all-exposure population, the overall rate of serious infections remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. The most common serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, sepsis and bacterial arthritis. Cases of opportunistic infections have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In the cardiovascular outcomes Study WA25204, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks group, with or without DMARD, was 4.5 per 100 patient-years, and the rate in the etanercept 50 mg weekly SC group, with or without DMARD, was 3.2 per 100 patient-years [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Gastrointestinal Perforations During the 24 week, controlled clinical trials, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation was 0.26 events per 100 patient-years with tocilizumab-IV therapy. In the all-exposure population, the overall rate of gastrointestinal perforation remained consistent with rates in the controlled periods of the studies. Reports of gastrointestinal perforation were primarily reported as complications of diverticulitis including generalized purulent peritonitis, lower GI perforation, fistula and abscess. Most patients who developed gastrointestinal perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate [see The relative contribution of these concomitant medications versus tocilizumab-IV to the development of GI perforations is not known. Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Infusion Reactions In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, adverse events associated with the infusion (occurring during or within 24 hours of the start of infusion) were reported in 8% and 7% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD group, respectively, compared to 5% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. The most frequently reported event on the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg dose during the infusion was hypertension (1% for both doses), while the most frequently reported event occurring within 24 hours of finishing an infusion were headache (1% for both doses) and skin reactions (1% for both doses), including rash, pruritus and urticaria. These events were not treatment limiting. Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions requiring treatment discontinuation, including anaphylaxis, associated with tocilizumab-IV were reported in 0.1% (3 out of 2644) in the 24 week, controlled trials and in 0.2% (8 out of 4009) in the all-exposure population. These reactions were generally observed during the second to fourth infusion of tocilizumab-IV. Appropriate medical treatment should be available for immediate use in the event of a serious hypersensitivity reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Laboratory Abnormalities Neutropenia In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, decreases in neutrophil counts below 1000 per mm 3 occurred in 1.8% and 3.4% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD group, respectively, compared to 0.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. Approximately half of the instances of ANC below 1000 per mm 3 occurred within 8 weeks of starting therapy. Decreases in neutrophil counts below 500 per mm 3 occurred in 0.4% and 0.3% of patients in the 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD, respectively, compared to 0.1% of patients in the placebo plus DMARD group. There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1000 per mm 3 and the occurrence of serious infections. In the all-exposure population, the pattern and incidence of decreases in neutrophil counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week controlled clinical studies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Thrombocytopenia In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, decreases in platelet counts below 100,000 per mm 3 occurred in 1.3% and 1.7% of patients on 4 mg per kg and 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD, respectively, compared to 0.5% of patients on placebo plus DMARD, without associated bleeding events. In the all-exposure population, the pattern and incidence of decreases in platelet counts remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week controlled clinical studies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Elevated Liver Enzymes Liver enzyme abnormalities are summarized in Table 1. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of tocilizumab-IV, or reduction in tocilizumab-IV dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes [see These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency Dosage and Administration (2.8) ]. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) ].

In Study WA25204, of the 1538 patients with moderate to severe RA [see and treated with tocilizumab, elevations in ALT or AST >3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 5.3% and 2.2% patients, respectively. One serious event of drug induced hepatitis with hyperbilirubinemia was reported in association with tocilizumab. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Lipids Elevations in lipid parameters (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides) were first assessed at 6 weeks following initiation of tocilizumab-IV in the controlled 24 week clinical trials. Increases were observed at this time point and remained stable thereafter. Increases in triglycerides to levels above 500 mg per dL were rarely observed. Changes in other lipid parameters from baseline to week 24 were evaluated and are summarized below: Mean LDL increased by 13 mg per dL in the tocilizumab 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 20 mg per dL in the tocilizumab 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 25 mg per dL in tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy. Mean HDL increased by 3 mg per dL in the tocilizumab 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 5 mg per dL in the tocilizumab 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 4 mg per dL in tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy. Mean LDL/HDL ratio increased by an average of 0.14 in the tocilizumab 4 mg per kg+DMARD arm, 0.15 in the tocilizumab 8 mg per kg+DMARD, and 0.26 in tocilizumab 8 mg per kg monotherapy. ApoB/ApoA1 ratios were essentially unchanged in tocilizumab-treated patients. Elevated lipids responded to lipid lowering agents. In the all-exposure population, the elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week, controlled clinical trials. Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of tocilizumab or of other tocilizumab products. In the 24 week, controlled clinical studies, a total of 2876 patients have been tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies. Forty-six patients (2%) developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies, of whom 5 had an associated, medically significant, hypersensitivity reaction leading to withdrawal. Thirty patients (1%) developed neutralizing antibodies. Malignancies During the 24 week, controlled period of the studies, 15 malignancies were diagnosed in patients receiving tocilizumab-IV, compared to 8 malignancies in patients in the control groups. Exposure-adjusted incidence was similar in the tocilizumab-IV groups (1.32 events per 100 patient-years) and in the placebo plus DMARD group (1.37 events per 100 patient-years). In the all-exposure population, the rate of malignancies remained consistent with the rate observed in the 24 week, controlled period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Other Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions occurring in 2% or more of patients on 4 or 8 mg per kg tocilizumab-IV plus DMARD and at least 1% greater than that observed in patients on placebo plus DMARD are summarized in Table 2 . Table 2 Adverse Reactions Occurring in at Least 2% or More of Patients on 4 or 8 mg per kg Tocilizumab plus DMARD and at Least 1% Greater Than That Observed in Patients on Placebo plus DMARD 24 Week Phase 3 Controlled Study Population Preferred Term Tocilizumab 8 mg per kg MONOTHERAPY Methotrexate Tocilizumab 4 mg per kg + DMARDs Tocilizumab 8 mg per kg + DMARDs Placebo + DMARDs N = 288 (%) N = 284 (%) N = 774 (%) N = 1582 (%) N =1170 (%) Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 7 5 6 8 6 Nasopharyngitis 7 6 4 6 4 Headache 7 2 6 5 3 Hypertension 6 2 4 4 3 ALT increased 6 4 3 3 1 Dizziness 3 1 2 3 2 Bronchitis 3 2 4 3 3 Rash 2 1 4 3 1 Mouth Ulceration 2 2 1 2 1 Abdominal Pain Upper 2 2 3 3 2 Gastritis 1 2 1 2 1 Transaminase increased 1 5 2 2 1 Other infrequent and medically relevant adverse reactions occurring at an incidence less than 2% in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with tocilizumab-IV in controlled trials were: Infections and Infestations: oral herpes simplex Gastrointestinal disorders: stomatitis, gastric ulcer Investigations: weight increased, total bilirubin increased Blood and lymphatic system disorders: leukopenia General disorders and administration site conditions: edema peripheral Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea, cough Eye disorders: conjunctivitis Renal disorders: nephrolithiasis Endocrine disorders: hypothyroidism 6.2 Clinical Trials Experience in Giant Cell Arteritis Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV) The safety of tocilizumab-IV was studied in an open label PK-PD and safety study in 24 patients with GCA who were in remission on tocilizumab-IV at time of enrollment. Patients received tocilizumab 7 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 20 weeks, followed by 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. The total patient years exposure to treatment was 17.5 years. The safety of tocilizumab by another route of administration has been studied in one Phase III study with 251 GCA patients. The total patient years duration was 138.5 patient years during the 12-month double blind, placebo-controlled phase of the study. The overall safety profile observed was generally consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab. There was an overall higher incidence of infections in GCA patients relative to RA patients. The overall safety profile observed for tocilizumab administered intravenously in GCA patients was consistent with the known safety profile of tocilizumab. 6.3 Clinical Trials Experience in Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV) The safety of tocilizumab-IV was studied in 188 pediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age with PJIA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to methotrexate. The total patient exposure in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population (defined as patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab-IV) was 184.4 patient years. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking oral corticosteroids and almost 80% were taking methotrexate. In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with PJIA were consistent with those seen in RA and SJIA patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.4) ]. Infections The rate of infections in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing less than 30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing at or above 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was also numerically higher in patients weighing less than 30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21%) compared to patients weighing at or above 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (8%). Infusion Reactions In PJIA patients, infusion-related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, 11 patients (6%) experienced an event during the infusion, and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an infusion. The most common events occurring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension, and occurring within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and SJIA patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.4) ]. No clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported. Immunogenicity One patient, in the 10 mg/kg less than 30 kg group, developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies without developing a hypersensitivity reaction and subsequently withdrew from the study. Laboratory Abnormalities Neutropenia During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, a decrease in neutrophil counts below 1 \u00d7 10 9 per L occurred in 3.7% of patients. There was no clear relationship between decreases in neutrophils below 1 \u00d7 10 9 per L and the occurrence of serious infections. Thrombocytopenia During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, 1% of patients had a decrease in platelet count at or less than 50,000 per mm 3 without associated bleeding events. Elevated Liver Enzymes During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, elevation in ALT or AST at or greater than 3 \u00d7 ULN occurred in 4% and less than 1% of patients, respectively. Lipids During routine laboratory monitoring in the tocilizumab all exposure population, elevation in total cholesterol greater than 1.5-2 \u00d7 ULN occurred in one patient (0.5%) and elevation in LDL greater than 1.5-2 \u00d7 ULN occurred in one patient (0.5%). 6.4 Clinical Trials Experience in Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV) The data described below reflect exposure to tocilizumab-IV in one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 112 pediatric patients with SJIA 2 to 17 years of age who had an inadequate clinical response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking 0.3 mg/kg/day corticosteroids or more, and almost 70% were taking methotrexate. The trial included a 12 week controlled phase followed by an open-label extension. In the 12 week double-blind, controlled portion of the clinical study 75 patients received treatment with tocilizumab-IV (8 or 12 mg per kg based upon body weight). After 12 weeks or at the time of escape, due to disease worsening, patients were treated with tocilizumab-IV in the open-label extension phase. The most common adverse events (at least 5%) seen in tocilizumab-IV treated patients in the 12 week controlled portion of the study were: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, nasopharyngitis and diarrhea. Infections In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of all infections in the tocilizumab-IV group was 345 per 100 patient-years and 287 per 100 patient-years in the placebo group. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of infections was 304 per 100 patient-years. In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the tocilizumab-IV group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the overall rate of serious infections was 11.4 per 100 patient years. The most commonly reported serious infections included pneumonia, gastroenteritis, varicella, and otitis media. Macrophage Activation Syndrome In the 12 week controlled study, no patient in any treatment group experienced macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) while on assigned treatment; 3 per 112 (3%) developed MAS during open-label treatment with tocilizumab-IV. One patient in the placebo group escaped to tocilizumab-IV 12 mg per kg at Week 2 due to severe disease activity, and ultimately developed MAS at Day 70. Two additional patients developed MAS during the long-term extension. All 3 patients had tocilizumab-IV dose interrupted (2 patients) or discontinued (1 patient) for the MAS event, received treatment, and the MAS resolved without sequelae. Based on a limited number of cases, the incidence of MAS does not appear to be elevated in the tocilizumab-IV SJIA clinical development experience; however no definitive conclusions can be made. Infusion Reactions Patients were not premedicated, however most patients were on concomitant corticosteroids as part of their background treatment for SJIA. Infusion related reactions were defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours after an infusion. In the 12 week controlled phase, 4% of tocilizumab-IV and 0% of placebo treated patients experienced events occurring during infusion. One event (angioedema) was considered serious and life-threatening, and the patient was discontinued from study treatment. Within 24 hours after infusion, 16% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV treatment group and 5% of patients in the placebo group experienced an event. In the tocilizumab-IV group the events included rash, urticaria, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, arthralgia and headache. One of these events, urticaria, was considered serious. Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis was reported in 1 out of 112 patients (less than 1%) treated with tocilizumab-IV during the controlled and open label extension study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Immunogenicity All 112 patients were tested for anti-tocilizumab antibodies at baseline. Two patients developed positive anti-tocilizumab antibodies: one of these patients experienced serious adverse events of urticaria and angioedema consistent with an anaphylactic reaction which led to withdrawal; the other patient developed macrophage activation syndrome while on escape therapy and was discontinued from the study. Laboratory Abnormalities Neutropenia During routine monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, a decrease in neutrophil below 1 \u00d7 10 9 per L occurred in 7% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV group, and in no patients in the placebo group. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, a decreased neutrophil count occurred in 17% of the tocilizumab-IV group. There was no clear relationship between decrease in neutrophils below 1 \u00d7 10 9 per L and the occurrence of serious infections. Thrombocytopenia During routine monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, 1% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV group and 3% in the placebo group had a decrease in platelet count to no more than 100,000 per mm 3 . In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, decreased platelet count occurred in 4% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV group, with no associated bleeding. Elevated Liver Enzymes During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in ALT or AST at or above 3\u00d7 ULN occurred in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively in the tocilizumab-IV group and in 0% of placebo patients. In the open label extension over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the elevation in ALT or AST at or above 3\u00d7 ULN occurred in 13% and 5% of tocilizumab-IV treated patients, respectively. Lipids During routine laboratory monitoring in the 12 week controlled phase, elevation in total cholesterol greater than 1.5\u00d7 ULN \u2013 2\u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.5% of the tocilizumab-IV group and in 0% of placebo patients. Elevation in LDL greater than 1.5\u00d7 ULN \u2013 2\u00d7 ULN occurred in 1.9% of patients in the tocilizumab-IV group and 0% of the placebo group. In the open label extension study over an average duration of 73 weeks of treatment, the pattern and incidence of elevations in lipid parameters remained consistent with the 12 week controlled study data. 6.5 Clinical Trials Experience in COVID-19 Patients Treated with Intravenous Tocilizumab (Tocilizumab-IV) The safety of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was evaluated in a pooled safety population that includes patients enrolled in EMPACTA, COVACTA, AND REMDACTA. The analysis of adverse reactions included a total of 974 patients exposed to tocilizumab. Patients received a single, 60-minute infusion of intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800 mg). If clinical signs or symptoms worsened or did not improve, one additional dose of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg could be administered between 8- 24 hours after the initial dose. Adverse reactions summarized in Table 3 occurred in at least 3% of tocilizumab -treated patients and more commonly than in patients on placebo in the pooled safety population. Table 3 Adverse Reactions Patients are counted once for each category regardless of the number of reactions Identified From the Pooled COVID-19 Safety Population Adverse Reaction Tocilizumab 8mg per kg Placebo N = 974 (%) N = 483 (%) Hepatic Transaminases increased 10% 8% Constipation 9% 8% Urinary tract infection 5% 4% Hypertension 4% 1% Hypokalaemia 4% 3% Anxiety 4% 2% Diarrhea 4% 2% Insomnia 4% 3% Nausea 3% 2% In the pooled safety population, the rates of infection/serious infection events were 30%/19% in patients receiving tocilizumab versus 32%/23% receiving placebo. Laboratory Abnormalities In the pooled safety population of EMPACTA, COVACTA, and REMDACTA, neutrophil counts <1000 cells/mcl occurred in 3.4% of patients who received tocilizumab and 0.5% of patients who received placebo. Platelet counts <50,000 cells/mcl occurred in 3.2% of patients who received tocilizumab and 1.5% of patients who received placebo. ALT or AST at or above 5\u00d7 ULN occurred in 11.7% of patients who received tocilizumab and 9.9% of patients who received placebo. 6.6 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of tocilizumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
