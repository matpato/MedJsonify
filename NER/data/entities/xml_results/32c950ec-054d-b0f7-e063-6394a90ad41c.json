    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ticagrelor tablet is a P2Y 12 platelet inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. (1.1) to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events. While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets was established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). (1.2) to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA). (1.3) 1.1 Acute Coronary Syndrome or a History of Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. For at least the first 12 months following ACS, it is superior to clopidogrel. Ticagrelor tablets also reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS [see . Clinical Studies (14.1) ] 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease but No Prior Stroke or Myocardial Infarction Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events [see . While use is not limited to this setting, the efficacy of ticagrelor tablets were established in a population with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Clinical Studies (14.2) ] 1.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) Ticagrelor tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score \u22645) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) [see .

(4.3) 4.1 History of Intracranial Hemorrhage Ticagrelor tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) because of a high risk of recurrent ICH in this population [see . Clinical Studies (14.1) , (14.2) ] 4.2 Active Bleeding Ticagrelor tablets are contraindicated in patients with active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial hemorrhage [see .

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Dyspnea was reported more frequently with ticagrelor tablets than with control agents in clinical trials. Dyspnea from ticagrelor tablets is self-limiting. (5.3) Severe Hepatic Impairment: Likely increase in exposure to ticagrelor. (5.5) Laboratory Test Interference: False negative platelet functional test results have been reported for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). Ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT. (5.7) 5.1 Risk of Bleeding Drugs that inhibit platelet function including ticagrelor tablets increase the risk of bleeding [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Patients treated for acute ischemic stroke or TIA Patients at NIHSS >5 and patients receiving thrombolysis were excluded from THALES and use of ticagrelor tablets in such patients is not recommended. 5.2 Discontinuation of Ticagrelor Tablets in Patients Treated for Coronary Artery Disease Discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets will increase the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in patients being treated for coronary artery disease. If ticagrelor tablets must be temporarily discontinued (e.g., to treat bleeding or for significant surgery), restart it as soon as possible. When possible, interrupt therapy with ticagrelor tablets for five days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding. Resume ticagrelor tablets as soon as hemostasis is achieved. 5.3 Dyspnea In clinical trials, about 14% (PLATO and PEGASUS) to 21% (THEMIS) of patients treated with ticagrelor tablets developed dyspnea. Dyspnea was usually mild to moderate in intensity and often resolved during continued treatment but led to study drug discontinuation in 0.9% (PLATO), 1.0% (THALES), 4.3% (PEGASUS), and 6.9% (THEMIS) of patients. In a substudy of PLATO, 199 subjects underwent pulmonary function testing irrespective of whether they reported dyspnea. There was no indication of an adverse effect on pulmonary function assessed after one month or after at least 6 months of chronic treatment. If a patient develops new, prolonged, or worsened dyspnea that is determined to be related to ticagrelor tablets, no specific treatment is required; continue ticagrelor tablets without interruption if possible. In the case of intolerable dyspnea requiring discontinuation of ticagrelor tablets, consider prescribing another antiplatelet agent. 5.4 Bradyarrhythmias Ticagrelor tablets can cause ventricular pauses [see Bradyarrhythmias including AV block have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Patients with a history of sick sinus syndrome, 2 Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. nd or 3 rd degree AV block or bradycardia-related syncope not protected by a pacemaker were excluded from clinical studies and may be at increased risk of developing bradyarrhythmias with ticagrelor. 5.5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of ticagrelor tablets in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment is likely to increase serum concentration of ticagrelor. There are no studies of ticagrelor tablets patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 5.6 Central Sleep Apnea Central sleep apnea (CSA) including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) has been reported in the post-marketing setting in patients taking ticagrelor, including recurrence or worsening of CSA/CSR following rechallenge. If central sleep apnea is suspected, consider further clinical assessment. 5.7 Laboratory Test Interferences False negative functional tests for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) Ticagrelor tablets have been reported to cause false negative results in platelet functional tests (including the heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA) assay) for patients with Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). This is related to inhibition of the P2Y 12 -receptor on the healthy donor platelets in the test by ticagrelor in the affected patient\u2019s serum/plasma. Information on concomitant treatment with ticagrelor tablets is required for interpretation of HIT functional tests. Based on the mechanism of ticagrelor tablets interference, ticagrelor tablets are not expected to impact PF4 antibody testing for HIT.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Dyspnea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are bleeding and dyspnea.

Ticagrelor tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 58,000 patients. Bleeding in PLATO (Reduction in risk of thrombotic events in ACS) Figure 1 is a plot of time to the first non-CABG major bleeding event. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to first non-CABG PLATO-defined major bleeding event (PLATO) Frequency of bleeding in PLATO is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. About half of the non-CABG major bleeding events were in the first 30 days.

PLATO Major bleed: any one of the following: fatal; intracranial; intrapericardial with cardiac tamponade; hypovolemic shock or severe hypotension requiring intervention; significantly disabling (e.g., intraocular with permanent vision loss); associated with a decrease in Hb of at least 3 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 9%); transfusion of 2 or more units. PLATO Major bleed, fatal/life-threatening: any major bleed as described above and associated with a decrease in Hb of more than 5 g/dL (or a fall in hematocrit (Hct) of at least 15%); transfusion of 4 or more units. Fatal: A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. No baseline demographic factor altered the relative risk of bleeding with ticagrelor tablets compared to clopidogrel. In PLATO, 1584 patients underwent CABG surgery. The percentages of those patients who bled are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. Figure 2 - \u2018Major fatal/life-threatening\u2019 CABG-related bleeding by days from last dose of study drug to CABG procedure (PLATO) X-axis is days from last dose of study drug prior to CABG. The PLATO protocol recommended a procedure for withholding study drug prior to CABG or other major surgery without unblinding. If surgery was elective or non-urgent, study drug was interrupted temporarily, as follows: If local practice was to allow antiplatelet effects to dissipate before surgery, capsules (blinded clopidogrel) were withheld 5 days before surgery and tablets (blinded ticagrelor) were withheld for a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 72 hours before surgery. If local practice was to perform surgery without waiting for dissipation of antiplatelet effects capsules and tablets were withheld 24 hours prior to surgery and use of aprotinin or other hemostatic agents was allowed. If local practice was to use IPA monitoring to determine when surgery could be performed both the capsules and tablets were withheld at the same time and the usual monitoring procedures followed.

Fatal : A bleeding event that directly led to death within 7 days. TIMI Minor : Clinically apparent with 3-5 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin. The bleeding profile of ticagrelor tablets 60 mg compared to aspirin alone was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups (e.g., by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy, stent, and medical history) for TIMI Major and TIMI Major or Minor bleeding events. Other Adverse Reactions in PEGASUS Adverse reactions that occurred in PEGASUS at rates of 3% or more are shown in Table 5.

Figure 4 \u2013 Time course of GUSTO severe bleeding events KM%: Kaplan-Meier percentage evaluated at Day 30; T = Ticagrelor; P = placebo; N = Number of patients GUSTO Severe: Any one of the following: fatal bleeding, intracranial bleeding (excluding asymptomatic hemorrhagic transformations of ischemic brain infarctions and excluding microhemorrhages < 10 mm evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging), bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mmg Hg that required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support, or surgical intervention). Intracranial bleeding and fatal bleeding in THALES: In total, there were 21 intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) for ticagrelor tablets and 6 ICHs for placebo. Fatal bleedings, almost all ICH, occurred in 11 for ticagrelor tablets and in 2 for placebo. Bradycardia In a Holter substudy of about 3000 patients in PLATO, more patients had ventricular pauses with ticagrelor tablets (6.0%) than with clopidogrel (3.5%) in the acute phase; rates were 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively, after 1 month. PLATO, PEGASUS, THEMIS and THALES excluded patients at increased risk of bradycardic events (e.g., patients who have sick sinus syndrome, 2 nd or 3 rd degree AV block, or bradycardic-related syncope and not protected with a pacemaker). Lab abnormalities Serum Uric Acid: In PLATO, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.6 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 90 mg and approximately 0.2 mg/dL on clopidogrel. The difference disappeared within 30 days of discontinuing treatment. Reports of gout did not differ between treatment groups in PLATO (0.6% in each group). In PEGASUS, serum uric acid levels increased approximately 0.2 mg/dL from baseline on ticagrelor tablets 60 mg and no elevation was observed on aspirin alone. Gout occurred more commonly in patients on ticagrelor tablets than in patients on aspirin alone (1.5%, 1.1%). Mean serum uric acid concentrations decreased after treatment was stopped. Serum Creatinine: In PLATO, a >50% increase in serum creatinine levels was observed in 7.4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 90 mg compared to 5.9% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The increases typically did not progress with ongoing treatment and often decreased with continued therapy. Evidence of reversibility upon discontinuation was observed even in those with the greatest on treatment increases. Treatment groups in PLATO did not differ for renal-related serious adverse events such as acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, toxic nephropathy, or oliguria. In PEGASUS, serum creatinine concentration increased by >50% in approximately 4% of patients receiving ticagrelor tablets 60 mg, similar to aspirin alone. The frequency of renal related adverse events was similar for ticagrelor and aspirin alone regardless of age and baseline renal function. figure_1 fiigure_2 figure_3 figure_4 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ticagrelor tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) has been rarely reported with the use of ticagrelor tablets. TTP is a serious condition which can occur after a brief exposure (<2 weeks) and requires prompt treatment. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema [see . Contraindications (4.3) ] Respiratory Disorders: Central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Rash",
