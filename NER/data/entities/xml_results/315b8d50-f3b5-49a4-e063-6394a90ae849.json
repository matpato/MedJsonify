    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery: Patients receiving alprazolam should be cautioned against operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle, as well as avoiding concomitant use of alcohol and other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant drugs. ( 5.4 ) Patients with Depression: Exercise caution in patients with signs or symptoms of depression. Prescribe the least number of tablets feasible to avoid intentional overdosage. ( 5.6 ) Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome: Alprazolam use during pregnancy can result in neonatal sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal. ( 5.8 , 8.1 ) 5.1 Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe alprazolam concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of alprazolam than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking alprazolam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when alprazolam is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] 5.2 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction The use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often ( but not always ) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death [see . Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 ) ] Before prescribing alprazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction ( e.g. , using a standardized screening tool ) . Use of alprazolam, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of alprazolam along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction ( e.g. , opioid analgesics, stimulants ) ; and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the patient and institute ( or refer them for ) early treatment, as appropriate. 5.3 Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue alprazolam or reduce the dosage ( a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose ) [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of alprazolam after continued use, or administration of flumazenil ( a benzodiazepine antagonist ) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening ( e.g. , seizures ) [see . Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ] Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months [see . Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ] Certain adverse clinical events, some life-threatening, are a direct consequence of physical dependence to alprazolam. These include a spectrum of withdrawal symptoms; the most important is seizure [see . Even after relatively short-term use at doses of Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ] < 4 mg/day, there is some risk of dependence. Spontaneous reporting system data suggest that the risk of dependence and its severity appear to be greater in patients treated with doses greater than 4 mg/day and for long periods ( more than 12 weeks ) . However, in a controlled postmarketing discontinuation study of panic disorder patients who received alprazolam, the duration of treatment ( 3 months compared to 6 months ) had no effect on the ability of patients to taper to zero dose. In contrast, patients treated with doses of alprazolam greater than 4 mg/day had more difficulty tapering to zero dose than those treated with less than 4 mg/day. In a controlled clinical trial in which 63 patients were randomized to alprazolam and where withdrawal symptoms were specifically sought, the following were identified as symptoms of withdrawal: heightened sensory perception, impaired concentration, dysosmia, clouded sensorium, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, diarrhea, blurred vision, appetite decrease, and weight loss. Other symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, were frequently seen during discontinuation, but it could not be determined if they were due to return of illness, rebound, or withdrawal. Interdose Symptoms Early morning anxiety and emergence of anxiety symptoms between doses of alprazolam have been reported in patients with panic disorder taking prescribed maintenance doses. These symptoms may reflect the development of tolerance or a time interval between doses which is longer than the duration of clinical action of the administered dose. In either case, it is presumed that the prescribed dose is not sufficient to maintain plasma levels above those needed to prevent relapse, rebound, or withdrawal symptoms over the entire course of the interdosing interval. 5.4 Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery Because of its CNS depressant effects, patients receiving alprazolam should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. For the same reason, patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with alprazolam [see . Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] 5.5 Interaction with Drugs that Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3 A The initial step in alprazolam metabolism is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 3 A ( CYP3 A ) . Drugs that inhibit this metabolic pathway may have a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam. Strong CYP3 A Inhibitors Alprazolam is contraindicated in patients receiving strong inhibitors of CYP3 A ( such as azole antifungal agents ) , except ritonavir [see Ketoconazole and itraconazole have been shown Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . in vivo to increase plasma alprazolam concentrations 3.98 fold and 2.70 fold, respectively. Dosage adjustment is necessary when alprazolam and ritonavir are initiated concomitantly or when ritonavir is added to a stable dosage of alprazolam [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ] . Drugs demonstrated to be CYP3 A inhibitors on the basis of clinical studies involving alprazolam: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, and cimetidine [see Drug Interaction ( 7.1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] . Use caution and consider dose reduction of alprazolam, as appropriate, during co-administration with these drugs. 5.6 Patients with Depression Benzodiazepines may worsen depression. Panic disorder has been associated with primary and secondary major depressive disorders and increased reports of suicide among untreated patients. Consequently, appropriate precautions ( e.g. , limiting the total prescription size and increased monitoring for suicidal ideation ) should be considered in patients with depression. 5.7 Mania Episodes of hypomania and mania have been reported in association with the use of alprazolam in patients with depression [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 ) ] 5.8 Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome Use of alprazolam late in pregnancy can result in sedation ( respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia ) and/or withdrawal symptoms ( hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties ) in the neonate [see . Monitor neonates exposedtoalprazolam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these neonates accordingly. Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] 5.9 Risk in Patients with Impaired Respiratory Function There have been reports of death in patients with severe pulmonary disease shortly after the initiation of treatment with alprazolam. Closely monitor patients with impaired respiratory function. If signs and symptoms of respiratory depression, hypoventilation, or apnea occur, discontinue alprazolam.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Effects on Driving and Operating Machinery [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Patients with Depression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ] Risks in Patients with Impaired Respiratory Function [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] The most common adverse reactions reported in clinical trials for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder ( incidence > 5% and at least twice that of placebo ) include: impaired coordination, hypotension, dysarthria, and increased libido.

Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation in Treatment of Panic Disorder in Placebo-Controlled Trials In a larger database comprised of both controlled and uncontrolled studies in which 641 patients received alprazolam, discontinuation-emergent symptoms which occurred at a rate of over 5% in patients treated with alprazolam and at a greater rate than the placebo-treated group are shown in Table 3. Table 3: Discontinuation-Emergent Symptom Incidence Reported in \u22655% of Alprazolam-treated Patients and > Placebo-treated Patients n=number of patients. Alprazolam-treated Patients n=641 Nervous system disorders Insomnia Light-headedness Abnormal involuntary movement Headache Muscular twitching Impaired coordination Muscle tone disorders Weakness 29.5% 19.3% 17.3% 17.0% 6.9% 6.6% 5.9% 5.8% Psychiatric disorders Anxiety Fatigue and Tiredness Irritability Cognitive disorder Memory impairment Depression Confusional state 19.2% 18.4% 10.5% 10.3% 5.5% 5.1% 5.0% Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea/Vomiting Diarrhea Decreased salivation 16.5% 13.6% 10.6% Metabolism and nutrition disorders Weight loss Decreased appetite 13.3% 12.8% Dermatological disorders Sweating 14.4% Cardiovascular disorders Tachycardia 12.2% Special Senses Blurred vision 10.0% There have also been reports of withdrawal seizures upon rapid decrease or abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.3 ) ] . Paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, and other adverse behavioral effects such as agitation, rage, irritability, and aggressive or hostile behavior have been reported rarely. In many of the spontaneous case reports of adverse behavioral effects, patients were receiving other CNS drugs concomitantly and/or were described as having underlying psychiatric conditions. Should any of the above events occur, alprazolam should be discontinued. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients have suggested that patients who have borderline personality disorder, a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. Instances of irritability, hostility, and intrusive thoughts have been reported during discontinuation of alprazolam in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of alprazolam. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Endocrine disorders: Hyperprolactinemia General disorders and administration site conditions: Edema peripheral Hepatobiliary disorders: Hepatitis, hepatic failure Investigations: Liver enzyme elevations Psychiatric disorders: Hypomania, mania Reproductive system and breast disorders: Gynecomastia, galactorrhea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Photosensitivity reaction, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome",
