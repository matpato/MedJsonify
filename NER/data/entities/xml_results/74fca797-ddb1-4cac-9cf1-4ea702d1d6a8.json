    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in later-onset SMA (incidence at least 10% of patients treated with EVRYSDI and more frequent than control) were fever, diarrhea, and rash. ( 6.1 ) The most common adverse reactions in infantile-onset SMA were similar to those observed in later-onset SMA patients. Additionally, adverse reactions with an incidence of at least 10% were upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, constipation, vomiting, and cough. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials including patients with infantile-onset SMA, later-onset SMA, and pre-symptomatic SMA, a total of 491 patients (51% female, 74% Caucasian) were exposed to EVRYSDI for up to a median duration of 48.1 months (range: 0.6 to 63.4 months), with 231 patients receiving treatment for more than 24 months. At the time of first EVRYSDI dose, 90 (18%) patients were 18 years and older, 119 (24%) were 12 years to less than 18 years, 189 (39%) were 2 years to less than 12 years, 67 (14%) 2 months to less than 2 years, and 26 (5%) were less than 2 months. Clinical Trial in Later-Onset SMA The safety of EVRYSDI for later-onset SMA is based on data from a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study (Study 2 Part 2) in patients with SMA Type 2 or 3 (n = 180) [see The patient population in Study 2 Part 2 ranged in age from 2 to 25 years at the time of the first dose. Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of patients treated with EVRYSDI and at an incidence greater than on placebo) in Study 2 Part 2 were fever, diarrhea, and rash. Table 2 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of patients treated with EVRYSDI and at an incidence \u2265 5% greater than on placebo in Study 2 Part 2. Table 2 Adverse Reactions Reported in \u2265 5% of Patients Treated with EVRYSDI and with an Incidence \u2265 5% Greater Than on Placebo in Study 2 Part 2 Adverse Reaction EVRYSDI (N = 120) % Placebo (N = 60) % Fever Includes pyrexia and hyperpyrexia. 22 17 Diarrhea 17 8 Rash Includes rash, erythema, rash maculo-papular, rash erythematous, rash papular, dermatitis allergic, and folliculitis. 17 2 Mouth and aphthous ulcers 7 0 Arthralgia 5 0 Urinary tract infection Includes urinary tract infection and cystitis. 5 0 Clinical Trial in Infantile-Onset SMA The safety of EVRYSDI therapy for infantile-onset SMA is based on data from an open-label study in 62 patients (Study 1) [see The patient population ranged in age from 2 to 7 months at the time of the first EVRYSDI dose (weight range: 4.1 to 10.6 kg). Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in infantile-onset SMA patients treated with EVRYSDI in Study 1 were similar to those observed in later-onset SMA patients in Study 2. Additionally, the following adverse reactions reported in \u2265 10% of patients were: upper respiratory tract infection (including nasopharyngitis, rhinitis), lower respiratory tract infection (including pneumonia, bronchitis), constipation, vomiting, and cough. Clinical Trial in Pre-Symptomatic SMA The safety of EVRYSDI therapy for pre-symptomatic SMA is based on data from an open-label, single-arm study in 26 patients (Study 3) [see . The patient population ranged in age from 16 to 41 days  at the time of the first dose (weight range: 3.1 to 5.7 kg). The safety profile of EVRYSDI in pre-symptomatic patients in Study 3 is consistent with the safety profile for symptomatic SMA patients treated with EVRYSDI in clinical trials.
