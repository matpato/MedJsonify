    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Interstitial lung disease (ILD): Fatal ILD has occurred in patients receiving irinotecan including ONIVYDE. Discontinue ONIVYDE if ILD is diagnosed. ( 5.3 ) Severe hypersensitivity reaction: Permanently discontinue ONIVYDE for severe hypersensitivity reactions. ( 5.4 , 4 ) Embryo-fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.5 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1\tSevere Neutropenia ONIVYDE can cause severe or life-threatening neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis. In NAPOLI 3, Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 26% of patients receiving ONIVYDE in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (NALIRIFOX) and fatal neutropenic fever in 0.3% of patients [see In NAPOLI-1, Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving ONIVYDE in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin (ONIVYDE/FU/LV). Neutropenic sepsis occurred in 3% and fatal neutropenic sepsis in 0.8% Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In NAPOLI 3, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was similar among Asian patients [6 of 20 (30%)] compared to White patients [76 of 289 (26%)] receiving ONIVYDE in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin. Neutropenic fever was reported in 5% of Asian patients (1 of 20) compared to 2.3% of White patients (7 of 306). In NAPOLI-1, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was higher among Asian patients [18 of 33 (55%)] compared to White patients [13 of 73 (18%)] receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV. Neutropenic fever/neutropenic sepsis was reported in 6% of Asian patients compared to 1% of White patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Monitor complete blood cell counts on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle and more frequently if clinically indicated. Withhold ONIVYDE if the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is below 1500/mm 3 or if neutropenic fever occurs. Resume ONIVYDE when the ANC is 1500/mm 3 or above. Reduce ONIVYDE dose for Grade 3-4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever following recovery in subsequent cycles [see . Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] 5.2\tSevere Diarrhea ONIVYDE can cause severe and life-threatening diarrhea. Do not administer ONIVYDE to patients with a bowel obstruction. Severe or life-threatening diarrhea can follow one of two patterns: late onset diarrhea (onset more than 24 hours following chemotherapy) and early onset diarrhea (onset within 24 hours of chemotherapy, sometimes occurring with other symptoms of cholinergic reaction) [see . An individual patient may experience both early and late-onset diarrhea. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] In NAPOLI 3, Grade 3 and 4 diarrhea (early and late-onset) occurred in 20% receiving ONIVYDE in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (NALIRIFOX). In NAPOLI-1, Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea occurred in 13% receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 late onset diarrhea was 9% in patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 early onset diarrhea was 3% in patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV. Of patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV in NAPOLI-1, 34% received loperamide for late-onset diarrhea and 26% received atropine for early-onset diarrhea. To reduce the risk of severe diarrhea, patients should stop lactose-containing products, eat a low-fat diet and maintain hydration during treatment with ONIVYDE. Withhold ONIVYDE for Grade 2-4 diarrhea. Administer intravenous or subcutaneous atropine 0.25 to 1 mg (unless clinically contraindicated) for early onset diarrhea of any severity. Initiate loperamide for late onset diarrhea of any severity. Local institutional guidelines should be followed for the treatment of diarrhea that does not improve within 48 hours and may include the addition of diphenoxylate hydrochloride plus atropine sulfate or octreotide. Following recovery to Grade 1 diarrhea, resume ONIVYDE at a reduced dose [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.3\tInterstitial Lung Disease ONIVYDE can cause severe and fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD), including pneumonitis. Postmarketing cases of severe and fatal ILD have been reported with ONIVYDE. Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic medicinal products, colony stimulating factors or having previously received radiation therapy. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during ONIVYDE therapy. Withhold ONIVYDE in patients with new or progressive dyspnea, cough, and fever, pending diagnostic evaluation. Discontinue ONIVYDE in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ILD. 5.4\tSevere Hypersensitivity Reaction Irinotecan including ONIVYDE can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic reactions. Permanently discontinue ONIVYDE in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction [see Contraindications (4) , Adverse reactions (6.2) ]. 5.5\t Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on animal data with irinotecan HCl and the mechanism of action of ONIVYDE, ONIVYDE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were observed following treatment with irinotecan HCl, at doses resulting in irinotecan exposures lower than those achieved with ONIVYDE 70 mg/m 2 in humans, administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONIVYDE and for seven months following the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]",

Patients received ONIVYDE 50 mg/m Clinical Studies (14) ] 2 in combination with oxaliplatin 60 mg/m 2 , leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m 2 over 46 hours every 2 weeks (NALIRIFOX; N=383) or nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m 2 over 35 minutes and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 over 30 minutes on Day 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle (Gem+NabP; N=387). The median duration of exposure to ONIVYDE in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin was 24 weeks (range: 0 to 101 weeks). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 54% of patients who received ONIVYDE in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin. Serious adverse reactions in \u22652% of patients included infections including COVID-19 (14%), diarrhea (9%), vomiting (6%), nausea (4.9%), fatigue (3.8%), embolism (3.5%), gastrointestinal tract stenosis or obstruction (3.5%), hemorrhage (3%), abdominal pain (2.7%), cerebrovascular accident (2.7%), dehydration (2.7%), liver function test abnormalities (2.2%), and pyrexia (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients who received ONIVYDE in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin including cerebrovascular accident (1.1%), hemorrhage (0.5%), pneumonia (0.5%), sepsis (0.5%) and sudden death (0.5%). Permanent discontinuation of ONIVYDE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 17% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of ONIVYDE in \u22651% of patients included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, infections and cerebrovascular accident. Dosage reduction of ONIVYDE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 52% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage reduction in \u22651% of patients included anemia, decreased appetite, diarrhea, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, hypokalemia, liver function test abnormalities, nausea, mucosal inflammation, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, vomiting, thrombocytopenia and weight decreased. Dosage interruptions of ONIVYDE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 1.9% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u22650.5% of patients included hypersensitivity and infusion related reaction. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520% with a difference between arms of \u2265 5% for all grades or \u2265 2% for Grades 3 or 4 compared to Gem+NabP) of ONIVYDE in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, mucosal inflammation, constipation and decreased weight. The most common laboratory abnormalities (\u226510% Grade 3 or 4) were decreased neutrophils, decreased potassium, decreased lymphocyte and decreased hemoglobin. Table 3 and 4 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in the NAPOLI 3 study.

Protocol-specified therapy consisted of ONIVYDE 70 mg/m 2 with leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m 2 over 46 hours every 2 weeks (ONIVYDE/FU/LV; N=117), ONIVYDE 100 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks (N=147), or leucovorin 200 mg/m 2 and fluorouracil 2000 mg/m 2 over 24 hours weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 week rest (FU/LV; N=134) [see . Serum bilirubin within the institutional normal range, albumin \u2265 3 g/dL, and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) \u2265 70 were required for study entry. The median duration of exposure was 9 weeks in the ONIVYDE/FU/LV arm, 9 weeks in the ONIVYDE monotherapy arm, and 6 weeks in the FU/LV arm. Clinical Studies (14) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) of ONIVYDE were diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite, stomatitis, and pyrexia. The most common, severe laboratory abnormalities (\u2265 10% Grade 3 or 4) were lymphopenia and neutropenia. The most common serious adverse reactions (\u2265 2%) of ONIVYDE were diarrhea, vomiting, neutropenic fever or neutropenic sepsis, nausea, pyrexia, sepsis, dehydration, septic shock, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of ONIVYDE in 11% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV; the most frequent adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of ONIVYDE were diarrhea, vomiting, and sepsis. Dose reductions of ONIVYDE for adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV; the most frequent adverse reactions requiring dose reductions were neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, and anemia. ONIVYDE was withheld or delayed for adverse reactions in 62% of patients receiving ONIVYDE/FU/LV; the most frequent adverse reactions requiring interruption or delays were neutropenia, diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and thrombocytopenia. Table 5 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions in NAPOLI-1 that occurred with higher incidence (\u22655% difference for Grades 1-4 or \u22652% difference for Grades 3-4) in patients who received ONIVYDE/FU/LV compared to patients who received FU/LV.

In NAPOLI-1, Grade 1 or 2 cholinergic symptoms other than early diarrhea occurred in 12 (4.5%) ONIVYDE-treated patients. Six of these 12 patients received atropine and in 1 of the 6 patients, atropine was administered for cholinergic symptoms other than diarrhea. Infusion Reactions : Infusion reactions, consisting of rash, urticaria, periorbital edema, or pruritus, occurring on the day of ONIVYDE administration were reported in 3% of patients receiving ONIVYDE or ONIVYDE/FU/LV. Laboratory abnormalities that occurred with higher incidence in the ONIVYDE/FU/LV arm compared to the FU/LV arm (\u22655% difference) are summarized in the following table.
