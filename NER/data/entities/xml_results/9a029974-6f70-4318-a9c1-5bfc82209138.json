    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ZUBSOLV is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence.  ZUBSOLV should be used as\u00a0part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support. ZUBSOLV contains buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, and naloxone, an opioid antagonist, and is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence. ( 1 ) ZUBSOLV should be used as part of a complete treatment plan that includes counseling and psychosocial support. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ZUBSOLV is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone as serious adverse reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. Hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse : Buprenorphine can be abused in a similar manner to other opioids. Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits. ( 5.1 ) Respiratory Depression : Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine use. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with ZUBSOLV. ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) Unintentional Pediatric Exposure : Store ZUBSOLV safely out of the sight and reach of children. Buprenorphine can cause severe and fatal respiratory depression in children. ( 5.4 ) Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome : Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy. ( 5.5 ) Adrenal Insufficiency : If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid. ( 5.6 ) Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment is temporarily interrupted or discontinued, monitor patients for withdrawal and treat appropriately. ( 5.7 ) Risk of Hepatitis; Hepatic Events : Monitor liver function tests prior to initiation and during treatment and evaluate suspected hepatic events. ( 5.8 ) Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms : An opioid withdrawal syndrome is likely to occur with parenteral misuse of ZUBSOLV by individuals physically dependent on full opioid agonists or by sublingual administration before the agonist effects of other opioids have subsided. ( 5.10 ) Risk of Overdose in Opioid-Na\u00efve Patients: ZUBSOLV is not appropriate as an analgesic. There have been reported deaths of opioid na\u00efve individuals who received a 2 mg equivalent sublingual dose of buprenorphine. ( 5.11 ) 5.1 Addiction, Abuse and Misuse ZUBSOLV contains buprenorphine, a schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Prescribe and dispense buprenorphine with appropriate precautions to minimize risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion, and ensure appropriate protection from theft, including in the home. Clinical monitoring appropriate to the patient\u2019s level of stability is essential. Multiple refills should not be prescribed early in treatment or without appropriate patient follow-up visits [see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9.2 )]. 5.2 Risk of Life-Threatening Respiratory and Central Nervous System (CNS) Depression Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death. Many, but not all, post-marketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol. Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with ZUBSOLV [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Use ZUBSOLV with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help right away in the event of a known or suspected overdose [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.8 )]. Patient Access to Naloxone for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose Discuss the availability of naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose with the patient and caregiver. Because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, both when initiating and renewing treatment with ZUBSOLV. Also consider prescribing naloxone if the patient has household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] Advise patients and caregivers that naloxone may also be administered for a known or suspected overdose with ZUBSOLV itself. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary due to the long duration of action of ZUBSOLV and its affinity for the mu receptor [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Inform patients and caregivers of their options for obtaining naloxone as permitted by individual state naloxone dispensing and prescribing requirements or guidelines (e.g., by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, or as part of a community-based program). Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression and, if naloxone is prescribed, how to treat with naloxone. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if naloxone is administered [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . 5.3 Managing Risks from Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose and death.  Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs.  Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone. As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment. Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients. However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate. Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use.  In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate. For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia.  Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia.  Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient\u2019s buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use. If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs.  Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. 5.4 Unintentional Pediatric Exposure Buprenorphine can cause fatal respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it. Store buprenorphine containing medications safely out of the sight and reach of children and destroy any unused medication appropriately [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit. Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate. Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly [see Use in Specific Populations ( ) 8.1 ] . Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with ZUBSOLV of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. This risk must be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance and benefits of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy. 5.6 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 5.7 Risk of Opioid Withdrawal with Abrupt Discontinuation Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation or rapid taper. The withdrawal syndrome is typically milder than seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset. When discontinuing ZUBSOLV, gradually taper the dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.8 )] 5.8 Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through post-marketing adverse event reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role. In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality. Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases; however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary. The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases. Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment is recommended to establish a baseline. Periodic monitoring of liver function during treatment is also recommended. A biological and etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic event is suspected. Depending on the case, ZUBSOLV may need to be carefully discontinued to prevent withdrawal signs and symptoms and a return by the patient to illicit drug use, and strict monitoring of the patient should be initiated. 5.9 Hypersensitivity Reactions Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine and naloxone containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or naloxone is a contraindication to the use of ZUBSOLV. 5.10 Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Because it contains naloxone, ZUBSOLV is likely to produce withdrawal signs and symptoms if misused parenterally by individuals dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone. Because of the partial agonist properties of buprenorphine, ZUBSOLV may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in such persons if administered sublingually before the agonist effects of the opioid have subsided. 5.11 Risk of Overdose in Opioid Na\u00efve Patients There have been reported deaths of opioid naive individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet for analgesia. ZUBSOLV is not appropriate as an analgesic. 5.12 Use in Patients with Impaired Hepatic Function Buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may not be appropriate for patients with moderate hepatic impairment. The doses of buprenorphine and naloxone in this fixed-dose combination product cannot be individually titrated, and hepatic impairment results in a reduced clearance of naloxone to a much greater extent than buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with severe hepatic impairment will be exposed to substantially higher levels of naloxone than patients with normal hepatic function. This may result in an increased risk of precipitated withdrawal at the beginning of treatment (induction) and may interfere with buprenorphine\u2019s efficacy throughout treatment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the differential reduction of naloxone clearance compared to buprenorphine clearance is not as great as in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. However, buprenorphine/naloxone products are not recommended for initiation of treatment (induction) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment due to the increased risk of precipitated withdrawal. Buprenorphine/naloxone products may be used with caution for maintenance treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment who have initiated treatment on a buprenorphine product without naloxone. Patients should be carefully monitored and consideration given to the possibility of naloxone interfering with buprenorphine\u2019s efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. 5.13 Dental Adverse Events Cases of dental caries, some severe (i.e., tooth fracture, tooth loss), have been reported following the use of transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products. Reported events include cavities, tooth decay, dental abscesses/infection, rampant caries, tooth erosion, fillings falling out, and, in some cases, total tooth loss. Treatment for these events included tooth extraction, root canal, dental surgery, as well as other restorative procedures (i.e., fillings, crowns, implants, dentures). Multiple cases were reported in individuals without any prior history of dental problems. Refer patients to dental care services and encourage them to have regular dental checkups while taking ZUBSOLV. Educate patients to seek dental care and strategies to maintain or improve oral health while being treated with transmucosal buprenorphine-containing products. Strategies include, but are not limited to, gently rinsing the teeth and gums with water and then swallowing after\u00a0ZUBSOLV has been completely dissolved in the oral mucosa. Advise patients to wait for at least one hour after taking\u00a0ZUBSOLV before brushing teeth [see Dosing and Administration ( 2.5 ), Information for Patients ( 17 ), Medication Guide ]. 5.14 QTc Prolongation Thorough QT studies with buprenorphine products have demonstrated QT prolongation \u226415 msec. This QTc prolongation effect does not appear to be mediated by hERG channels. Based on these two findings, buprenorphine is unlikely to be pro-arrhythmic when used alone in patients without risk factors. The risk of combining buprenorphine with other QT prolonging agents is not known. Consider these observations in clinical decisions when prescribing\u00a0ZUBSOLV to patients with risk factors such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, recent conversion from atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, digitalis therapy, baseline QT prolongation, subclinical long-QT syndrome, or severe hypomagnesemia. 5.15 Impairment of Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery ZUBSOLV may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. Caution patients about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that ZUBSOLV therapy does not adversely affect his or her ability to engage in such activities. 5.16 Orthostatic Hypotension Like other opioids, ZUBSOLV may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 5.17 Elevation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure Buprenorphine, like other opioids, may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation. 5.18 Elevation of Intracholedochal Pressure Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 5.19 Effects in Acute Abdominal Conditions As with other opioids, buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.",

ZUBSOLV for use as initial treatment was evaluated in two clinical trials that had identical, blinded, two-day induction phases, comparing ZUBSOLV to generic buprenorphine. On the first day, subjects received an initial dose of ZUBSOLV 1.4 mg/0.36 mg or generic buprenorphine 2 mg, followed by ZUBSOLV 4.2 mg/1.08 mg or generic buprenorphine 6 mg 1.5 hours later. In total, safety data were available for 538 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to ZUBSOLV (buprenorphine/naloxone) sublingual tablets when used for initial treatment. Table 1.

The prospective evaluation of buprenorphine/naloxone was supported by clinical trials using buprenorphine tablets without naloxone and other trials using buprenorphine sublingual solutions. In total, safety data were available from 3214 opioid-dependent subjects exposed to buprenorphine at doses in the range used in treatment of opioid addiction. See Table 2. Table 2.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most frequently reported post-marketing adverse event not observed in clinical trials was peripheral edema. Serotonin syndrome: Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency: Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis: Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in ZUBSOLV. Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Local reactions : Dental decay (including caries, tooth fracture, and tooth loss),glossodynia, glossitis, oral mucosal erythema, oral hypoesthesia, and stomatitis. Hypoglycemia : Cases of hypoglycemia have been reported in patients taking opioids. Most reports were in patients with at least one predisposing risk factor (e.g., diabetes).",
