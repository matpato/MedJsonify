    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Trichomoniasis Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of trichomoniasis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis . The organism should be identified by appropriate diagnostic procedures. Because trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease with potentially serious sequelae, partners of infected patients should be treated simultaneously in order to prevent re-infection [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 1.2 Giardiasis Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of giardiasis caused by Giardia duodenalis (also termed G. lamblia) in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. 1.3 Amebiasis Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess caused by Entamoeba histolytica in both adults and pediatric patients older than three years of age. It is not indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic cyst passage [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4)]. 1.4 Bacterial Vaginosis Tinidazole is indicated for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis) in adult women [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis such as Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans and Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out. 1.5 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tinidazole and other antibacterial drugs, tinidazole should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Tinidazole is a nitroimidazole antimicrobial indicated for: \u2022 Trichomoniasis (1.1) \u2022 Giardiasis: in patients age 3 and older (1.2) \u2022 Amebiasis: in patients age 3 and older (1.3) \u2022 Bacterial Vaginosis: in adult women (1.4, 8.1) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of tinidazole and other antibacterial drugs, tinidazole should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria (1.5).",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of tinidazole is contraindicated: In patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to tinidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives. Reported reactions have ranged in severity from urticaria to Stevens-Johnson syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. In patients with Cockayne syndrome. Severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure with fatal outcomes have been reported after initiation of metronidazole, another nitroimidazole drug, structurally related to tinidazole, in patients with Cockayne syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] Prior history of hypersensitivity to tinidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives (4, 6.1, 6.2) Patients with Cockayne syndrome (4, 6.2)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Seizures and neuropathy have been reported. Discontinue tinidazole if abnormal neurologic signs develop (5.1) Vaginal candidiasis may develop with tinidazole and require treatment with an antifungal agent (5.2) Use tinidazole with caution in patients with blood dyscrasias. Tinidazole may produce transient leukopenia and neutropenia (5.3, 7.3) 5.1 Potential for Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity Carcinogenicity has been seen in mice and rats treated chronically with nitroimidazole derivatives, which are structurally related to tinidazole [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Although such data have not been reported for tinidazole, the two drugs are structurally related and have similar biologic effects. However, it is unclear if the positive tumor findings in lifetime rodent studies indicate a risk to patients taking a short course or single dose of TINIDAZOLE. Use should be limited to approved indications only. Avoid chronic use. 5.2 Neurological Adverse Reactions Convulsive seizures and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity, have been reported in patients treated with tinidazole. The appearance of abnormal neurologic signs demands the prompt discontinuation of tinidazole therapy. 5.3 Vaginal Candidiasis The use of tinidazole may result in Candida vaginitis. In a clinical study of 235 women who received tinidazole for bacterial vaginosis, a vaginal fungal infection developed in 11 (4.7%) of all study subjects [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )]. 5.4 Blood Dyscrasia Tinidazole should be used with caution in patients with evidence of or history of blood dyscrasia [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. 5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing tinidazole in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions for a single 2 g dose of tinidazole (incidence >1%) are metallic/bitter taste, nausea, weakness/fatigue/malaise, dyspepsia/cramps/epigastric discomfort, vomiting, anorexia, headache, dizziness and constipation (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact BioComp Pharma at 1-866-762-2365 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Among 3669 patients treated with a single 2 g dose of tinidazole, in both controlled and uncontrolled trichomoniasis and giardiasis clinical studies, adverse reactions were reported by 11.0% of patients. For multi-day dosing in controlled and uncontrolled amebiasis studies, adverse reactions were reported by 13.8% of 1765 patients. Common (\u2265 1% incidence) adverse reactions reported by body system are as follows. (Note: Data described in Table 1 below are pooled from studies with variable designs and safety evaluations.) Other adverse reactions reported with tinidazole include: Central Nervous System: Two serious adverse reactions reported include convulsions and transient peripheral neuropathy including numbness and paresthesia [see Warnings and Precautions ( Other CNS reports include vertigo, ataxia, giddiness, insomnia, drowsiness. 5.1 )]. Gastrointestinal: tongue discoloration, stomatitis, diarrhea Hypersensitivity: urticaria, pruritis, rash, flushing, sweating, dryness of mouth, fever, burning sensation, thirst, salivation, angioedema Renal: darkened urine Cardiovascular: palpitations Hematopoietic: transient neutropenia, transient leukopenia Other: Candida overgrowth, increased vaginal discharge, oral candidiasis, hepatic abnormalities including raised transaminase level, arthralgias, myalgias, and arthritis. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Summary of Published Reports 2 g single dose Multi-day dose GI: Metallic/bitter taste 3.7% 6.3% Nausea 3.2% 4.5% Anorexia 1.5% 2.5% Dyspepsia/cramps/epigastric discomfort 1.8% 1.4% Vomiting 1.5% 0.9% Constipation 0.4% 1.4% CNS: Weakness/fatigue/malaise 2.1% 1.1% Dizziness 1.1% 0.5% Other: Headache 1.3% 0.7% Total patients with adverse reactions 11.0% (403/3669) 13.8% (244/1765) Rare reported adverse reactions include bronchospasm, dyspnea, coma, confusion, depression, furry tongue, pharyngitis and reversible thrombocytopenia. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients: In pooled pediatric studies, adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients taking tinidazole were similar in nature and frequency to adult findings including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, taste change, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Bacterial vaginosis: The most common adverse reactions in treated patients (incidence >2%), which were not identified in the trichomoniasis, giardiasis and amebiasis studies, are gastrointestinal: decreased appetite, and flatulence; renal: urinary tract infection, painful urination, and urine abnormality; and other reactions including pelvic pain, vulvo-vaginal discomfort, vaginal odor, menorrhagia, and upper respiratory tract infection [See Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )]. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during post-approval use of tinidazole. Because the reports of these reactions are voluntary and the population is of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of the reaction or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Tinidazole: Severe acute hypersensitivity reactions have been reported on initial or subsequent exposure to tinidazole or other nitroimidazole agents. Hypersensitivity reactions may include urticaria, pruritis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme. Metronidazole, Another Nitroimidazole Product, Structurally Related to Tinidazole: Cases of severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure, including cases with fatal outcomes with very rapid onset after initiation of systemic use of metronidazole, another nitroimidazole agent structurally related to tinidazole, have been reported in patients with Cockayne syndrome (latency from drug start to signs of liver failure as short as 2 days) [see Contraindications (4)].",
