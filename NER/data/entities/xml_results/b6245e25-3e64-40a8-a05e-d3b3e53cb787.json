    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of: Schizophrenia. ( 1.1 ) Bipolar I disorder, manic, or mixed episodes. ( 1.2 ) Bipolar disorder, depressive episodes. ( 1.2 ) Major depressive disorder, adjunctive therapy with antidepressants. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Schizophrenia Quetiapine extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release tablets in schizophrenia was established in one 6-week and one maintenance trial in adults with schizophrenia. Efficacy was supported by three 6-week trials in adults with schizophrenia and one 6-week trial in adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years) treated with SEROQUEL [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. 1.2 Bipolar Disorder Quetiapine extended-release tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release tablets in manic or mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder was established in one 3-week trial in adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. Efficacy was supported by two 12-week monotherapy trials and one 3-week adjunctive trial in adults with manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder as well as one 3-week monotherapy trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years) with manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder treated with SEROQUEL [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Quetiapine extended-release tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release tablets was established in one 8-week trial in adults with bipolar I or II disorder and supported by two 8\u00ad-week trials in adults with bipolar I or II disorder treated with SEROQUEL [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Quetiapine extended-release tablets are indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was extrapolated from two maintenance trials in adults with bipolar I disorder treated with SEROQUEL. The effectiveness of monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 1.3 Adjunctive Treatment of Major Depressive\nDisorder (MDD) Quetiapine extended-release tablets are indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of MDD. The efficacy of quetiapine extended-release tablets as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in MDD was established in two 6-week trials in adults with MDD who had an inadequate response to antidepressant treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. 1.4 Special Considerations\nin Treating\nPediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I\nDisorder Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders, however, diagnosis can be challenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.",

( 5.3 ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Manage with immediate discontinuation and close monitoring. ( 5.4 ) Metabolic Changes: Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with metabolic changes. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain. ( 5.5 ) Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus: Monitor patients for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Monitor glucose regularly in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes. Dyslipidemia: Undesirable alterations have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended, including fasting blood lipid testing at the beginning of, and periodically, during treatment. Weight Gain: Gain in body weight has been observed; clinical monitoring of weight is recommended. Tardive Dyskinesia: Discontinue if clinically appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Hypotension: Use with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. ( 5.7 ) Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents: Monitor blood pressure at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment in children and adolescents. ( 5.9 ) Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis: Monitor complete blood count frequently during the first few months of treatment in patients with a pre-existing low white cell count or a history of leukopenia/neutropenia and discontinue quetiapine extended-release at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors. ( 5.10 ) Cataracts: Lens changes have been observed in patients during long-term quetiapine treatment. Lens examination is recommended when starting treatment and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment. ( 5.11 ) Anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) Effects: Use with caution with other anticholinergic drugs and in patients with urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation. ( 5.20 ) 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly\nPatients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10-weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Quetiapine extended-release is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning ]. 5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young\nAdults Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2. T able 2: Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1,000 Patients Treated A ge Range D rug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo < 18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases D ecreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case \u2265 65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. A l l patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. F a m i l i es and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for quetiapine extended-release tablets should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, including quetiapine extended-release, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. 5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions,\nIncluding Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. Quetiapine extended-release is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see and Boxed Warning Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported. 5.5 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. In some patients, a worsening of more than one of the metabolic parameters of weight, blood glucose, and lipids was observed in clinical studies. Changes in these metabolic profiles should be managed as clinically appropriate. H yperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse reactions in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

Includes SEROQUEL\u00a0and quetiapine extended-release data. In a 24-week trial (active-controlled, 115 patients treated with SEROQUEL) designed to evaluate glycemic status with oral glucose tolerance testing of all patients, at week 24 the incidence of post-glucose challenge glucose level \u2265 200 mg/dL was 1.7% and the incidence of a fasting blood glucose level \u2265 126 mg/dL was 2.6%. The mean change in fasting glucose from baseline was 3.2 mg/dL and mean change in 2-hour glucose from baseline was -1.8 mg/dL for quetiapine. In 2 long-term placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal clinical trials for bipolar I disorder maintenance, mean exposure of 213 days for SEROQUEL\u00a0(646 patients) and 152 days for placebo (680 patients), the mean change in glucose from baseline was +5.0 mg/dL for quetiapine and \u20130.05 mg/dL for placebo. The exposure-adjusted rate of any increased blood glucose level (\u2265 126 mg/dL) for patients more than 8 hours since a meal (however, some patients may not have been precluded from calorie intake from fluids during fasting period) was 18.0 per 100 patient years for SEROQUEL\u00a0(10.7% of patients; n=556) and 9.5 for placebo per 100 patient years (4.6% of patients; n=581).

In a placebo-controlled quetiapine extended-release monotherapy study (8-weeks duration) of children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the mean change in fasting glucose levels for quetiapine extended-release (n = 60) compared to placebo (n = 62) was 1.8 mg/dL versus 1.6 mg/dL. In this study, there were no patients in the quetiapine extended-release or placebo-treated groups with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (< 100 mg/dL) that had an increase in blood glucose level \u2265 126 mg/dL. There was one patient in the quetiapine extended-release group with a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (\u2265 100 mg/dL and < 126 mg/dL) who had an increase in blood glucose level of > 126 mg/dL compared to zero patients in the placebo group. Clinical Studies (14.2) ] In a placebo-controlled SEROQUEL\u00a0monotherapy study of adolescent patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia (6-weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose levels for SEROQUEL\u00a0(n=138) compared to placebo (n=67) was \u20130.75 mg/dL versus \u20131.70 mg/dL. In a placebo-controlled SEROQUEL\u00a0monotherapy study of children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania (3-weeks duration), the mean change in fasting glucose level for SEROQUEL\u00a0(n=170) compared to placebo (n=81) was 3.62 mg/dL versus \u20131.17 mg/dL. No patient in either study with a baseline normal fasting glucose level (<100 mg/dL) or a baseline borderline fasting glucose level (\u2265 100 mg/dL and < 126 mg/dL) had a blood glucose level of \u2265 126 mg/dL.

In an open-label study that enrolled patients from the above two pediatric trials, 63% of patients (241/380) completed 26-weeks of therapy with SEROQUEL. After 26 weeks of treatment, the mean increase in body weight was 4.4 kg. Forty-five percent of the patients gained \u2265 7% of their body weight, not adjusted for normal growth. In order to adjust for normal growth over 26-weeks, an increase of at least 0.5 standard deviation from baseline in BMI was used as a measure of a clinically significant change; 18.3% of patients on SEROQUEL\u00a0met this criterion after 26-weeks of treatment. When treating pediatric patients with SEROQUEL\u00a0for any indication, weight gain should be assessed against that expected for normal growth. 5.6 Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs including quetiapine. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, quetiapine extended-release should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on quetiapine extended-release, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with quetiapine despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.7 Hypotension Quetiapine may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably reflecting its \u03b1 1 -adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 0.3% (5/1866) of the patients treated with quetiapine extended-release across all indications, compared with 0.2% (2/928) on placebo. Syncope was reported in 1% (28/3,265) of the patients treated with SEROQUEL, compared with 0.2% (2/954) on placebo. Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope may lead to falls. Quetiapine should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, or conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications). If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration schedule is appropriate. 5.8 Falls Atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine extended-release, may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor, and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.9 Increases in Blood Pressure (Children and Adolescents) Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release is supported by studies of \u00a0SEROQUEL\u00a0in children and adolescent patients 10 to 17 years of age [see and Clinical Studies (14.1 14.2) ]. In a placebo-controlled quetiapine extended-release clinical trial (8-weeks duration) in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (\u2265 20 mmHg) was 6.5% (6/92) for quetiapine extended-release and 6.0% (6/100) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (\u2265 10 mmHg) was 46.7% (43/92) for quetiapine extended-release and 36.0% (36/100) for placebo. In placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with schizophrenia (13 to 17 years old, 6-week duration) or bipolar mania (10 to 17 years old, 3-week duration), the incidence of increases at any time in systolic blood pressure (\u2265 20 mmHg) was 15.2% (51/335) for SEROQUEL\u00a0and 5.5% (9/163) for placebo; the incidence of increases at any time in diastolic blood pressure (\u2265 10 mmHg) was 40.6% (136/335) for SEROQUEL\u00a0and 24.5% (40/163) for placebo. In the 26-week open-label clinical trial, one child with a reported history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis. Blood pressure in children and adolescents should be measured at the beginning of, and periodically during treatment. 5.10 Leukopenia,\nNeutropenia, and\nAgranulocytosis In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine. Agranulocytosis has also been reported. Agranulocytosis has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal cases and cases in patients without pre-existing risk factors. Neutropenia should be considered in patients presenting with infection, particularly in the absence of obvious predisposing factor(s), or in patients with unexplained fever, and should be managed as clinically appropriate. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue quetiapine extended-release at the first sign of a decline in WBC in absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1,000/mm 3 ) should discontinue quetiapine extended-release and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.11 Cataracts The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies [see Lens changes have also been observed in adults, children, and adolescents during long-term quetiapine treatment but a causal relationship to quetiapine use has not been established. Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as slit lamp exam or other appropriately sensitive methods, is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6-month intervals during chronic treatment. Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. 5.12 QT Prolongation In clinical trials quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in QT intervals. However, the QT effect was not systematically evaluated in a thorough QT study. In post marketing experience there were cases reported of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on quetiapine [see , in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking medicines known to cause electrolyte imbalance or increase QT interval Overdosage (10.1) ] . The use of quetiapine should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc including Class 1A antiarrythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), antipsychotic medications (e.g., ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine), antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin), or any other class of medications known to prolong the QTc interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone). Quetiapine should also be avoided in circumstances that may increase the risk of occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death including (1) a history of cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval. Caution should also be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with increased risk of QT prolongation (e.g., cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, the elderly, congestive heart failure and heart hypertrophy). 5.13 Seizures During short-term clinical trials with quetiapine extended-release, seizures occurred in 0.05% (1/1,866) of patients treated with quetiapine extended-release across all indications compared to 0.3% (3/928) on placebo. During clinical trials with SEROQUEL, seizures occurred in 0.5% (20/3490) of patients treated with SEROQUEL\u00a0compared to 0.2% (2/954) on placebo. As with other antipsychotics, quetiapine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. 5.14 Hypothyroidism Adults: Clinical trials with quetiapine demonstrated dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels. The reduction in total and free thyroxine (T 4 ) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range was maximal in the first six weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression during more chronic therapy. In nearly all cases, cessation of quetiapine treatment was associated with a reversal of the effects on total and free T 4 , irrespective of the duration of treatment. The mechanism by which quetiapine effects the thyroid axis is unclear. If there is an effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, measurement of TSH alone may not accurately reflect a patient\u2019s thyroid status. Therefore, both TSH and free T 4 , in addition to clinical assessment, should be measured at baseline and at follow-up. In quetiapine extended-release clinical trials across all indications 1.8% (24/1,336) of patients on quetiapine extended-release versus 0.6% (3/530) on placebo experienced decreased free thyroxine (<0.8 LLN) and 1.6% (21/1,346) on quetiapine extended-release vs. 3.4% (18/534) on placebo experienced increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). About 0.7% (26/3,489) of SEROQUEL\u00a0patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Some patients with TSH increases needed replacement thyroid treatment. In all quetiapine trials, the incidence of shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH were 1 : decrease in free T 4 (<0.8 LLN), 2.0% (357/17,513); decrease in total T 4 (<0.8 LLN), 4.0% (75/1,861); decrease in free T 3 (<0.8 LLN), 0.4% (53/13,766); decrease in total T 3 (<0.8 LLN), 2.0% (26/1,312), and increase in TSH (>5 mIU/L), 4.9% (956/19,412). In eight patients, where TBG was measured, levels of TBG were unchanged. Table 11 shows the incidence of these shifts in short term placebo-controlled clinical trials. T able 11: Incidence of Shifts in Thyroid Hormone Levels and TSH in Short-term Placebo-controlled Clinical Trials 1 , 2 Total T4 Free T4 Total T3 Free T3 TSH Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo Quetiapine Placebo 3.4% (37/1097) 0.6% (4/651) 0.7% (52/7218) 0.1% (4/3668) 0.5% (2/369) 0.0% (0/113) 0.2% (11/5673) 0.0% (1/2679) 3.2% (240/7587) 2.7% (105/3912) Based on shifts from normal baseline to potentially clinically important value at any time post-baseline. Shifts in total T 4 , free T 4 , total T 3 and free T 3 are defined as < 0.8 x LLN (pmol/L) and shift in TSH is > 5 mIU/L at any time. Includes SEROQUEL\u00a0and quetiapine extended-release data. In short-term placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, the incidence of reciprocal shifts in T 3 and TSH was 0.0% for both quetiapine (1/4,800) and placebo (0/2,190) and for T 4 and TSH the shifts were 0.1% (7/6,154) for quetiapine versus 0.0% (1/3,007) for placebo. Children and Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release is supported by studies of SEROQUEL\u00a0in children and adolescent patients 10 to 17 years of age [see and Clinical Studies (14.1 14.2 )]. In acute placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescent patients with schizophrenia (6-week duration) or bipolar mania (3-week duration), the incidence of shifts at any time for SEROQUEL\u00a0treated patients and placebo-treated patients for elevated TSH was 2.9% (8/280) vs. 0.7% (1/138), respectively, and for decreased total thyroxine was 2.8% (8/289) vs. 0% (0/145), respectively. Of the SEROQUEL\u00a0treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 1 had simultaneous low free T 4 level at end of treatment. 5.15 Hyperprolactinemia Adults : During clinical trials with quetiapine across all indications, the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a clinically significant value occurred in 3.6% (158/4,416) of patients treated with quetiapine compared to 2.6% (51/1,968) on placebo. C hildren and Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release is supported by studies of SEROQUEL\u00a0in children and adolescent patients 10 to 17 years of age [see and Clinical Studies (14.1 In acute placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescent patients with bipolar mania (3-week duration) or schizophrenia (6-week duration), the incidence of shifts in prolactin levels to a value (>20 mcg/L males; > 26 mcg/L females at any time) was 13.4% (18/134) for SEROQUEL\u00a0compared to 4% (3/75) for placebo in males and 8.7% (9/104) for SEROQUEL\u00a0compared to 0% (0/39) for placebo in females. 14.2) ]. Like other drugs that antagonize dopamine D 2 receptors, quetiapine extended-release elevates prolactin levels in some patients and the elevation may persist during chronic administration. Hyperprolactinemia, regardless of etiology, may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia when associated with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male subjects. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, mammary gland, and pancreatic islet cell neoplasia (mammary adenocarcinomas, pituitary and pancreatic adenomas) was observed in carcinogenicity studies conducted in mice and rats [see Published epidemiologic studies have shown inconsistent results when exploring the potential association between hyperprolactinemia and breast cancer. Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 5.16 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Somnolence was a commonly reported adverse reaction reported in patients treated with quetiapine especially during the 3-day period of initial dose titration. In schizophrenia trials, somnolence was reported in 24.7% (235/951) of patients on quetiapine extended-release compared to 10.3% (33/319) of placebo patients. In a bipolar depression clinical trial, somnolence was reported in 51.8% (71/137) of patients on quetiapine extended-release compared to 12.9% (18/140) of placebo patients. In a clinical trial for bipolar mania, somnolence was reported in 50.3% (76/151) of patients on quetiapine extended-release compared to 11.9% (19/160) of placebo patients. Since quetiapine has the potential to impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles) or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Somnolence may lead to falls. In short-term adjunctive therapy trials for MDD, somnolence was reported in 40% (252/627) of patients on quetiapine extended-release respectively compared to 9% (27/309) of placebo patients. Somnolence was dose-related in these trials (37% (117/315) and 43% (135/312) for the 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively). 5.17 Body Temperature Regulation Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing quetiapine extended-release for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration. 5.18 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Quetiapine extended-release and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. 5.19 Discontinuation Syndrome Acute withdrawal symptoms, such as insomnia, nausea and vomiting have been described after abrupt cessation of atypical antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. In short-term placebo-controlled, monotherapy clinical trials with quetiapine extended-release that included a discontinuation phase which evaluated discontinuation symptoms, the aggregated incidence of patients experiencing one or more discontinuation symptoms after abrupt cessation was 12.1% (241/1,993) for quetiapine extended-release and 6.7% (71/1,065) for placebo. The incidence of the individual adverse reactions (i.e., insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness and irritability) did not exceed 5.3% in any treatment group and usually resolved after 1-week post-discontinuation. Gradual dose reduction is advised [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 5.20 Anticholinergic\n(antimuscarinic) Effects Norquetiapine, an active metabolite of quetiapine, has moderate to strong affinity for several muscarinic receptor subtypes. This contributes to anticholinergic adverse reactions when quetiapine extended-release is used at therapeutic doses, taken concomitantly with other anticholinergic medications, or taken in overdose. Quetiapine extended-release should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects [see and Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10.1) . Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] Constipation was a commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with quetiapine and represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction. Intestinal obstruction has been reported with quetiapine, including fatal reports in patients who were receiving multiple concomitant medications that decrease intestinal motility. Quetiapine extended-release should be used with caution in patients with a current diagnosis or prior history of urinary retention, clinically significant prostatic hypertrophy, or constipation.",

A dults The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for quetiapine extended-release consisting of approximately 3,400 patients exposed to quetiapine extended-release for the treatment of Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder in placebo-controlled trials. This experience corresponds to approximately 1,020.1 patient-years. Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions, results of physical examinations, vital signs, body weights, laboratory analyses and ECG results. The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, an adverse reaction of the type listed. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: Schizophrenia: There were no adverse reactions leading to discontinuation that occurred at an incidence of \u2265 2% for quetiapine extended-release in schizophrenia trials. Bipolar I Disorder, Manic or Mixed Episodes: There were no adverse reactions leading to discontinuation that occurred at an incidence of \u2265 2% for quetiapine extended-release in the bipolar mania trial. Bipolar Disorder, Depressive Episode: In a single clinical trial in patients with bipolar depression, 14% (19/137) of patients on quetiapine extended-release discontinued due to an adverse reaction compared to 4% (5/140) on placebo. Somnolence was the only adverse reaction leading to discontinuation that occurred at an incidence of \u2265 2% in quetiapine extended-release in the bipolar depression trial. M DD , Adjunctive Therapy: In adjunctive therapy clinical trials in patients with MDD, 12.1% (76/627) of patients on quetiapine extended-release discontinued due to adverse reaction compared to 1.9% (6/309) on placebo. Somnolence\u00a0was the only adverse reaction leading to discontinuation that occurred at an incidence of \u2265 2% in quetiapine extended-release in MDD trials. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: In short-term placebo-controlled studies for schizophrenia the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine extended-release (incidence of 5% or greater) and observed at a rate on quetiapine extended-release at least twice that of placebo were somnolence (25%), dry mouth (12%), dizziness (10%), and dyspepsia (5%).

Somnolence combines the adverse reaction terms somnolence and sedation. 2. Extrapyramidal symptoms include the terms: cogwheel rigidity, drooling, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal disorder, hypertonia, hypokinesia, psychomotor hyperactivity, restlessness, and tremor. Adverse Reactions in clinical trials with quetiapine and not listed elsewhere in the label Pyrexia, nightmares, peripheral edema, dyspnea, palpitations, rhinitis, eosinophilia, hypersensitivity, elevations in gamma- GT levels, and elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase (not associated with NMS), somnambulism (and other related events), hypothermia, decreased platelets, galactorrhea, bradycardia (which may occur at or near initiation of treatment and be associated with hypotension and/ or syncope), and priapism. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS): D ystonia C l ass Effect : Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Four methods were used to measure EPS: (1) Simpson-Angus total score (mean change from baseline) which evaluates Parkinsonism and akathisia, (2) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Global Assessment Score, (3) incidence of spontaneous complaints of EPS (akathisia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, extrapyramidal syndrome, hypertonia, hypokinesia, neck rigidity, and tremor), and (4) use of anticholinergic medications to treat EPS. Adults : In placebo-controlled clinical trials with quetiapine, utilizing doses up to 800 mg per day, the incidence of any adverse reactions related to EPS ranged from 8% to 11% for quetiapine and 4% to 11% for placebo. In three-arm placebo-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia, utilizing doses between 300 mg and 800 mg of quetiapine extended-release, the incidence of any adverse reactions related to EPS was 8% for quetiapine extended-release and 8% for SEROQUEL\u00a0(without evidence of being dose related), and 5% in the placebo group. In these studies, the incidence of the individual adverse reactions (akathisia, extrapyramidal disorder, tremor, dyskinesia, dystonia, restlessness, and muscle rigidity) was generally low and did not exceed 3% for any treatment group. At the end of treatment, the mean change from baseline in SAS total score and BARS Global Assessment score was similar across the treatment groups. The use of concomitant anticholinergic medications was infrequent and similar across the treatment groups. The incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was consistent with that seen with the profile of SEROQUEL\u00a0in schizophrenia patients. In Tables 16 to 19, dystonic event included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, muscle rigidity, oculogyration; parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity, tremor, drooling, hypokinesia; akathisia included akathisia, psychomotor agitation; dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia, choreoathetosis; and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness, extrapyramidal disorder, movement disorder.

This database includes 677 adolescents (13 to 17 years old) exposed to SEROQUEL\u00a0for the treatment of schizophrenia and 393 children and adolescents (10 to 17 years old) exposed to SEROQUEL\u00a0for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: Schizophrenia: The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapine-treated and placebo-treated patients was 8.2% and 2.7%, respectively. The adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in 2% or more of patients on quetiapine and at a greater incidence than placebo was somnolence (2.7% and 0% for placebo). Bipolar I Mania: The incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions for quetiapine-treated and placebo-treated patients was 11.4% and 4.4%, respectively. The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in 2% or more of patients on SEROQUEL\u00a0and at a greater incidence than placebo were somnolence (4.1% vs. 1.1%) and fatigue (2.1% vs. 0%). C ommonly Observed Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials: In an acute (8-week) quetiapine extended-release trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine extended-release (incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice that for placebo) were: dizziness (7%), diarrhea (5%), fatigue (5%) and nausea (5%). In therapy for schizophrenia (up to 6-weeks), the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in adolescents (incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (34%), dizziness (12%), dry mouth (7%), tachycardia (7%). In bipolar mania therapy (up to 3-weeks) the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of quetiapine in children and adolescents (incidence of 5% or greater and quetiapine incidence at least twice that for placebo) were somnolence (53%), dizziness (18%), fatigue (11%), increased appetite (9%), nausea (8%), vomiting (8%), tachycardia (7%), dry mouth (7%), and weight increased (6%). A dverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of \u2265 2% among SEROQUEL\u00a0Treated Patients in Short-Term, Placebo-Controlled Trials Schizophrenia (Adolescents, 13 to 17 years old) The following findings were based on a 6-week placebo-controlled trial in which quetiapine was administered in either doses of 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day. Table 20 enumerates the incidence, rounded to the nearest percent, of adverse reactions that occurred during therapy (up to 6-weeks) of schizophrenia in 2% or more of patients treated with SEROQUEL\u00a0(doses of 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day) where the incidence in patients treated with SEROQUEL\u00a0was greater than the incidence in placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions that were potentially dose-related with higher frequency in the 800 mg group compared to the 400 mg group included dizziness (8% vs. 15%), dry mouth (4% vs. 10%), and tachycardia (6% vs. 11%).

Extrapyramidal Symptoms: Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release is supported by studies of SEROQUEL\u00a0in children and adolescent patients 10 to 17 years of age [see and Clinical Studies (14.1 14.2 )]. In a short-term placebo-controlled quetiapine extended-release monotherapy trial in children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression (8-week duration), in which efficacy was not established, the aggregated incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 1.1% (1/92) for quetiapine extended-release and 0% (0/100) for placebo. In a short-term placebo-controlled SEROQUEL\u00a0monotherapy trial in adolescent patients (13 to 17 years of age) with schizophrenia (6-week duration), the aggregated incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 12.9% (19/147) for SEROQUEL\u00a0and 5.3% (4/75) for placebo, though the incidence of the individual adverse reactions (e.g., akathisia, tremor, extrapyramidal disorder, hypokinesia, restlessness, psychomotor hyperactivity, muscle rigidity, dyskinesia) did not exceed 4.1% in any treatment group. In a short-term placebo-controlled SEROQUEL\u00a0monotherapy trial in children and adolescent patients (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar mania (3-week duration), the aggregated incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms was 3.6% (7/193) for SEROQUEL\u00a0and 1.1% (1/90) for placebo. In Tables 22 and 23, dystonic events included nuchal rigidity, hypertonia, dystonia, and muscle rigidity; parkinsonism included cogwheel rigidity and tremor; akathisia included akathisia only; dyskinetic event included tardive dyskinesia, dyskinesia and choreoathetosis; and other extrapyramidal event included restlessness and extrapyramidal disorder.

There were no adverse reactions with the preferred term of dystonic or dyskinetic events. Laboratory, ECG and vital sign changes observed in clinical studies Laboratory Changes: Neutrophil Counts Adults: In three-arm quetiapine extended-release placebo-controlled monotherapy clinical trials, among patients with a baseline neutrophil count \u2265 1.5 x 10 9 /L, the incidence of at least one occurrence of neutrophil count <1.5 x 10 9 /L was 1.5% in patients treated with quetiapine extended-release and 1.5% for SEROQUEL, compared to 0.8% in placebo-treated patients. In placebo-controlled monotherapy clinical trials involving 3,368 patients on quetiapine and 1,515 on placebo, the incidence of at least one occurrence of neutrophil count <1.0 x 10 9 /L among patients with a normal baseline neutrophil count and at least one available follow up laboratory measurement was 0.3% (10/2,967) in patients treated with quetiapine, compared to 0.1% (2/1,349) in patients treated with placebo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Transaminase Elevations Adults: Asymptomatic, transient and reversible elevations in serum transaminases (primarily ALT) have been reported. The proportions of adult patients with transaminase elevations of >3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of placebo-controlled trials ranged between 1% and 2% for quetiapine extended-release compared to 2% for placebo. In schizophrenia trials in adults, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations of >3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled trials were approximately 6% (29/483) for SEROQUEL\u00a0compared to 1% (3/194) for placebo. These hepatic enzyme elevations usually occurred within the first 3-weeks of drug treatment and promptly returned to pre-study levels with ongoing treatment with quetiapine. Decreased Hemoglobin Adults: In short-term placebo-controlled trials, decreases in hemoglobin to \u2264 13 g/dL males, \u2264 12 g/dL females on at least one occasion occurred in 8.3% (594/7,155) of quetiapine-treated patients compared to 6.2% (219/3,536) of patients treated with placebo. In a database of controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, decreases in hemoglobin to \u2264 13 g/dL males, \u226412 g/dL females on at least one occasion occurred in 11% (2,277/20,729) of quetiapine-treated patients. Interference with Urine Drug Screens There have been literature reports suggesting false positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone and tricyclic antidepressants in patients who have taken quetiapine. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of positive urine drug screen results for these drugs, and confirmation by alternative analytical technique (e.g., chromatographic methods) should be considered. ECG Changes: Adults: 2.5% of quetiapine extended-release patients, and 2.3% of placebo patients, had tachycardia (>120 bpm) at any time during the trials. Quetiapine extended-release was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 6.3 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 0.4 beats per minute for placebo. This is consistent with the rates for SEROQUEL. The incidence of adverse reactions of tachycardia was 1.9% for quetiapine extended-release compared to 0.5% for placebo. SEROQUEL\u00a0use was associated with a mean increase in heart rate, assessed by ECG, of 7 beats per minute compared to a mean increase of 1 beat per minute among placebo patients. The slight tendency for tachycardia may be related to quetiapine\u2019s potential for inducing orthostatic changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. C hildren and Adolescents: Safety and effectiveness of quetiapine extended-release is supported by studies of SEROQUEL\u00a0in children and adolescent patients 10 to 17 years of age [see and Clinical Studies (14.1 14.2) ]. In an acute (8-week) quetiapine extended-release trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age) with bipolar depression, in which efficacy was not established, increases in heart rate (> 110 bpm 10 to 12 years and 13 to 17 years) occurred in 0% of patients receiving quetiapine extended-release and 1.2% of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.4 bpm for quetiapine extended-release, compared to 0.3 bpm in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. In the acute (6-week) SEROQUEL\u00a0schizophrenia trial in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age), increases in heart rate (> 110 bpm) occurred in 5.2% of patients receiving SEROQUEL\u00a0400 mg and 8.5% of patients receiving SEROQUEL\u00a0800 mg compared to 0% of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 3.8 bpm and 11.2 bpm for SEROQUEL\u00a0400 mg and 800 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 3.3 bpm in the placebo group [see Warnings and ]. Precautions (5.7) In the acute (3-week) SEROQUEL\u00a0bipolar mania trial in children and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), increases in heart rate (> 110 bpm) occurred in 1.1% of patients receiving SEROQUEL\u00a0400 mg and 4.7% of patients receiving SEROQUEL\u00a0600 mg compared to 0% of patients receiving placebo. Mean increases in heart rate were 12.8 bpm and 13.4 bpm for SEROQUEL\u00a0400 mg and 600 mg groups, respectively, compared to a decrease of 1.7 bpm in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. 6.2\nPost-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions were identified during post approval use of SEROQUEL. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported since market introduction which were temporally related to quetiapine therapy include anaphylactic reaction, cardiomyopathy, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), hyponatremia, myocarditis, nocturnal enuresis, pancreatitis, retrograde amnesia, rhabdomyolysis, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), decreased platelet count, serious liver reactions (including hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure), agranulocytosis, intestinal obstruction, ileus, colon ischemia, sleep apnea, urinary retention, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), confusional state and cutaneous vasculitis\u00a0and fecal incontinence.
