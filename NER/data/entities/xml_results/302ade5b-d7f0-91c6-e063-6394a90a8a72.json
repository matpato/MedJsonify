    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE FUROSCIX is indicated for the treatment of edema in adult patients with chronic heart failure or chronic kidney disease (CKD), including the nephrotic syndrome. FUROSCIX is a loop diuretic indicated for the treatment of edema in adult patients with chronic heart failure or chronic kidney disease, including the nephrotic syndrome. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS FUROSCIX is contraindicated in patients with anuria. FUROSCIX is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to furosemide, any component of the FUROSCIX formulation, or medical adhesives. Anuria ( 4 ) Hypersensitivity to furosemide, components of FUROSCIX formulation, or medical adhesives. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fluid, Electrolyte, and Metabolic Abnormalities : Monitor serum electrolytes, CO 2 , BUN, creatinine, glucose, and uric acid. ( 5.1 ) Worsening Renal Function : Monitor for dehydration and azotemia. ( 5.2 ) Ototoxicity : Avoid higher than recommended doses. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Acute Urinary Retention : Monitor patients with symptoms of urinary retention. ( 5.4 ) Incomplete Dosing : Fluid contact and certain patient movements during treatment may cause the On-body Infusor to prematurely terminate infusion. Ensure patients can detect and respond to alarms. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Fluid, Electrolyte, and Metabolic Abnormalities Furosemide may cause fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic abnormalities such as hypovolemia, hypokalemia, azotemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, or hyperuricemia, particularly in patients receiving higher doses, patients with inadequate oral electrolyte intake, and in elderly patients. Excessive diuresis may cause dehydration and blood volume reduction with circulatory collapse and possibly vascular thrombosis and embolism, particularly in elderly patients. Serum electrolytes, CO 2 , BUN, creatinine, glucose, and uric acid should be monitored frequently during furosemide therapy [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.6 )] 5.2 Worsening Renal Function Furosemide can cause dehydration and azotemia. If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, discontinue furosemide [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.3 Ototoxicity Cases of tinnitus and reversible or irreversible hearing impairment and deafness have been reported with furosemide. Reports usually indicate that furosemide ototoxicity is associated with rapid injection, severe renal impairment, the use of higher than recommended doses, hypoproteinemia or concomitant therapy with aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, or other ototoxic drugs. If the physician elects to use high-dose parenteral therapy, controlled intravenous infusion is advisable (for adults, an infusion rate not exceeding 4 mg furosemide per minute has been used) [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. 5.4 Acute Urinary Retention In patients with severe symptoms of urinary retention (because of bladder emptying disorders, prostatic hyperplasia, urethral narrowing), the administration of furosemide can cause acute urinary retention related to increased production and retention of urine. These patients require careful monitoring, especially during the initial stages of treatment. 5.5 Incomplete Dosing The On-body Infusor should not be allowed to get wet from water or any other fluids (blood or drug product). Fluid contact with the circuit board can lead to device errors and premature termination of infusion. The On-body Infusor is intended for use in a setting where the patient can limit their activity for the duration of administration. Certain patient movements may cause interruption of device adherence to skin and premature termination of infusion. The On-body Infusor for FUROSCIX should only be used in patients who can detect and respond to alarms to ensure a complete dose is administered.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Fluid, Electrolyte, and Metabolic Abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Ototoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of furosemide were identified in clinical trials or post-marketing reports. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably, or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions are categorized below by organ system and listed by decreasing severity. Gastrointestinal System Reactions : pancreatitis, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), increased liver enzymes, anorexia, oral and gastric irritation, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting. Systemic Hypersensitivity Reactions : severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions (e.g., with shock), systemic vasculitis, interstitial nephritis, necrotizing angiitis. Central Nervous System Reactions : tinnitus and hearing loss, paresthesias, vertigo, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, xanthopsia. Hematologic Reactions : aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, anemia, eosinophilia. Dermatologic Hypersensitivity Reactions : toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, purpura, photosensitivity, rash. Cardiovascular Reactions : orthostatic hypotension, increase in cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels. Administration Site and Skin Reactions : erythema, bruising, edema, infusion site pain. Other Reactions : glycosuria, muscle spasm, weakness, restlessness, urinary bladder spasm, thrombophlebitis, transient injection site pain following intramuscular injection, fever. The most common adverse reactions during treatment with the Furoscix Infusor were administration site and skin reactions: erythema, bruising, edema and infusion site pain.
