    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Darunavir, co-administered with ritonavir (darunavir/ritonavir), in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older [see and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) . Clinical Studies (14) ] Darunavir is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) protease inhibitor indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adult and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. Darunavir tablets must be co-administered with ritonavir (darunavir/ritonavir) and with other antiretroviral agents. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Co-administration of darunavir/ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index). Examples of these drugs and other contraindicated drugs (which may lead to reduced efficacy of darunavir) are listed below [see . Due to the need for co-administration of darunavir with ritonavir, please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for a description of ritonavir contraindications.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with darunavir/ritonavir. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. ( 5.2 ) Skin reactions ranging from mild to severe, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, have been reported. Discontinue treatment if severe reaction develops. ( 5.3 ) Use with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. ( 5.4 ) Patients may develop new onset diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia. Initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required. ( 5.6 ) Patients may develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat or immune reconstitution syndrome. ( 5.7 , 5.8 ) Patients with hemophilia may develop increased bleeding events. ( 5.9 ) Darunavir/ritonavir is not recommended in pediatric patients below 3 years of age in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir up to days 23 to 26 of age. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Importance of Co-administration with Ritonavir Darunavir must be co-administered with ritonavir and food to achieve the desired antiviral effect. Failure to administer darunavir with ritonavir and food may result in a loss of efficacy of darunavir. Please refer to ritonavir prescribing information for additional information on precautionary measures. 5.2 Hepatotoxicity Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with darunavir/ritonavir. During the clinical development program (N=3,063), hepatitis was reported in 0.5% of patients receiving combination therapy with darunavir/ritonavir. Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities including severe hepatic adverse events. Post-marketing cases of liver injury, including some fatalities, have been reported. These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications, having co-morbidities including hepatitis B or C co-infection, and/or developing immune reconstitution syndrome. A causal relationship with darunavir/ritonavir therapy has not been established. Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with darunavir/ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several months of darunavir/ritonavir treatment. Evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, hepatomegaly) in patients on darunavir/ritonavir should prompt consideration of interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 5.3 Severe Skin Reactions During the clinical development program (n=3,063), severe skin reactions, accompanied by fever and/or elevations of transaminases in some cases, have been reported in 0.4% of subjects. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome was rarely (less than 0.1%) reported during the clinical development program. During post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. Discontinue darunavir/ritonavir immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include but are not limited to severe rash or rash accompanied with fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. Rash (all grades, regardless of causality) occurred in 10.3% of subjects treated with darunavir/ritonavir [ see . Rash was mostly mild-to-moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of treatment and resolving with continued dosing. The discontinuation rate due to rash in subjects using darunavir/ritonavir was 0.5%. Adverse Reactions (6) ] Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced subjects receiving regimens containing darunavir/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir without raltegravir or raltegravir without darunavir/ritonavir. However, rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups. These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy; there were no discontinuations due to rash. 5.4 Sulfa Allergy Darunavir contains a sulfonamide moiety. Darunavir should be used with caution in patients with a known sulfonamide allergy. In clinical studies with darunavir/ritonavir, the incidence and severity of rash were similar in subjects with or without a history of sulfonamide allergy. 5.5 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions due to Drug Interactions Initiation of darunavir/ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving darunavir/ritonavir, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A and reduce plasma concentrations of active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A. Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of darunavir/ritonavir, respectively. These interactions may lead to: Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications. Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of darunavir/ritonavir. Loss of therapeutic effect of the concomitant medications from lower exposures of active metabolite(s). Loss of therapeutic effect of darunavir/ritonavir and possible development of resistance from lower exposures of darunavir/ritonavir. See Table 10 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions, including dosing recommendations [see . Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during darunavir/ritonavir therapy; review concomitant medications during darunavir/ritonavir therapy; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs Drug Interactions (7) ] [see and Contraindications (4 ) . Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.6 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported during post-marketing surveillance in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events. In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred. In those patients who discontinued PI therapy, hyperglycemia persisted in some cases. Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationships between PI therapy and these events have not been established. 5.7 Fat Redistribution Redistribution/accumulation of body fat, including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement (buffalo hump), peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, and \u201ccushingoid appearance\u201d have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not been established. 5.8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including darunavir. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment. 5.9 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with PIs. In some patients, additional factor VIII was given. In more than half of the reported cases, treatment with PIs was continued or reintroduced if treatment had been discontinued. A causal relationship between PI therapy and these episodes has not been established. 5.10 Not Recommended\nin Pediatric Patients Below 3 Years of Age Darunavir/ritonavir in pediatric patients below 3 years of age is not recommended in view of toxicity and mortality observed in juvenile rats dosed with darunavir (from 20 mg/kg to 1,000 mg/kg) up to days 23 to 26 of age [see and Use in Specific Populations (8.1 and 8.4 ) .
