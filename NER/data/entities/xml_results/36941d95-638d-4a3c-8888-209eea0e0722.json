    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 New Primary Malignancies, Cutaneous and Non-cutaneous: Can occur when MEKTOVI is used in combination with encorafenib. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment, and after discontinuation of treatment. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Cardiomyopathy: Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before initiating treatment, after one month of treatment, then every 2 to 3 months thereafter. The safety of MEKTOVI has not been established in patients with LVEF below 50%. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Venous Thromboembolism: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can occur. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Ocular Toxicities: Serous retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and uveitis have occurred. Perform an ophthalmologic evaluation at regular intervals and for any visual disturbances. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): Assess new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms or findings for possible ILD. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests before and during treatment with MEKTOVI and encorafenib and as clinically indicated. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Rhabdomyolysis: Monitor creatine phosphokinase and creatinine periodically and as clinically indicated. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Major hemorrhagic events can occur in patients receiving MEKTOVI and encorafenib. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females with reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.9 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 New Primary Malignancies New primary malignancies, cutaneous and non-cutaneous, can occur when MEKTOVI is used in combination with encorafenib. In PHAROS, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and skin papilloma each occurred in 2% of patients who received MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib. Monitor patients for new malignancies prior to initiation of treatment, while on treatment, and after discontinuation of treatment [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.2 Cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathy, manifesting as left ventricular dysfunction associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic decreases in ejection fraction, has been reported in patients treated with MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib. In COLUMBUS, evidence of cardiomyopathy (decrease in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute decrease in LVEF \u226510% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA) occurred in 7% of patients receiving MEKTOVI plus encorafenib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1.6% of patients. The median time to first occurrence of left ventricular dysfunction (any grade) in patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib was 3.6 months (range 0 to 21 months). Cardiomyopathy resolved in 87% of patients receiving MEKTOVI plus encorafenib. In PHAROS, evidence of cardiomyopathy (decrease in LVEF below the institutional LLN with an absolute decrease in LVEF \u226510% below baseline as detected by echocardiography or MUGA) occurred in 11% of patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib. Grade 3 left ventricular dysfunction occurred in 1% of patients. Cardiomyopathy resolved in 82% of patients receiving MEKTOVI plus encorafenib. Assess ejection fraction by echocardiogram or MUGA scan prior to initiating treatment, one month after initiating treatment, and then every 2 to 3 months during treatment. The safety of MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is either below 50% or below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN).
