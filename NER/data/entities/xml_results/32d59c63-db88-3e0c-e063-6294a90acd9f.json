( 5.2 ) Monitor heart rate decreases and bradycardia symptoms during treatment. ( 5.3 ) Not recommended in patients with 2 nd degree AV block. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Ivabradine tablets may cause fetal toxicity when administered to a pregnant woman based on findings in animal studies. Embryo-fetal toxicity and cardiac teratogenic effects were observed in fetuses of pregnant rats treated during organogenesis at exposures 1 to 3 times the human exposures (AUC 0 - 24hr ) at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) [see Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception when taking ivabradine tablets Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ] 5.2 Atrial Fibrillation Ivabradine tablets increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. In the Systolic Heart Failure Treatment with the I f Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial (SHIFT), the rate of atrial fibrillation was 5.0% per patient-year in patients treated with ivabradine tablets and 3.9% per patient-year in patients treated with placebo [see . Regularly monitor cardiac rhythm. Discontinue ivabradine tablets if atrial fibrillation develops. Clinical Studies (14) ] 5.3 Bradycardia and Conduction Disturbances Adult Patients Bradycardia, sinus arrest, and heart block have occurred with ivabradine tablets. The rate of bradycardia was 6.0% per patient-year in patients treated with ivabradine tablets (2.7% symptomatic; 3.4% asymptomatic) and 1.3% per patient-year in patients treated with placebo. Risk factors for bradycardia include sinus node dysfunction, conduction defects (e.g., 1 st or 2 nd degree atrioventricular block, bundle branch block), ventricular dyssynchrony, and use of other negative chronotropes (e.g., digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone). Bradycardia may increase the risk of QT prolongation which may lead to severe ventricular arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes, especially in patients with risk factors such as use of QTc prolonging drugs [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Concurrent use of verapamil or diltiazem will increase ivabradine tablets exposure, may themselves contribute to heart rate lowering, and should be avoided [see . Avoid use of ivabradine tablets in patients with 2 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] nd degree atrioventricular block unless a functioning demand pacemaker is present [see Contraindications (4) ].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinically significant adverse reactions that appear in other sections of the labeling include: Atrial Fibrillation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Bradycardia and Conduction Disturbances [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 1% of patients are bradycardia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation and luminous phenomena (phosphenes).

Adult Patients with Heart Failure In SHIFT, safety was evaluated in 3,260 patients treated with ivabradine tablets and 3,278 patients given placebo. The median duration of ivabradine tablets exposure was 21.5 months. The most common adverse drug reactions in the SHIFT trial are shown in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , ( 5.3 )]. Table 2. Adverse Drug Reactions with Rates \u2265 1.0% Higher on Ivabradine than Placebo occurring in > 1% on Ivabradine in SHIFT Ivabradine N = 3,260 Placebo N = 3,278 Bradycardia 10 % 2.2 % Hypertension, Blood Pressure Increased 8.9 % 7.8 % Atrial fibrillation 8.3 % 6.6 % Phosphenes, visual brightness 2.8 % 0.5 % Luminous Phenomena (Phosphenes) Phosphenes are phenomena described as a transiently enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field, halos, image decomposition (stroboscopic or kaleidoscopic effects), colored bright lights, or multiple images (retinal persistency). Phosphenes are usually triggered by sudden variations in light intensity. Ivabradine tablets can cause phosphenes, thought to be mediated through ivabradine tablets effects on retinal photoreceptors [see Onset is generally within the first 2 months of treatment, after which they may occur repeatedly. Phosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity and led to treatment discontinuation in < 1% of patients; most resolved during or after treatment. Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]. 6.2 Post marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified in adults during post-approval use of ivabradine tablets: syncope, hypotension, torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, angioedema, erythema, rash, pruritus, urticaria, vertigo, and diplopia, and visual impairment.",
