    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE CUVRIOR is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with stable Wilson's disease who are de-coppered and tolerant to penicillamine. CUVRIOR is a copper chelator indicated for the treatment of adult patients with stable Wilson's disease who are de-coppered and tolerant to penicillamine. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS CUVRIOR is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to trientine or to any of the excipients in CUVRIOR [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity to trientine or to any of the excipients in CUVRIOR. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for Worsening of Clinical Symptoms at Initiation of Therapy : May include neurological deterioration. Adjust dosage or discontinue CUVRIOR if clinical condition worsens. ( 5.1 ) Copper Deficiency : Periodic monitoring is required. ( 5.2 ) Iron Deficiency : If iron deficiency develops, a short course of iron supplementation may be given. ( 5.3 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions : If rash or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, consider discontinuing CUVRIOR. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Potential for Worsening of Clinical Symptoms at Initiation of Therapy Worsening of clinical symptoms, including neurological deterioration, may occur at the beginning of CUVRIOR therapy due to mobilization of excess stores of copper. Adjust the dosage or discontinue CUVRIOR if the patient's clinical condition worsens. Evaluate serum non-ceruloplasmin copper (NCC) levels when initiating CUVRIOR treatment, after 3 months of treatment and approximately every 6 months thereafter . Therapy may also be monitored periodically (every 6 to 12 months) with measurement of 24-hour urinary copper excretion (UCE) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.2 Copper Deficiency Copper deficiency may develop following treatment with CUVRIOR. Close monitoring for manifestations of copper deficiency is required particularly when copper requirements may change, such as in pregnancy, where appropriate control of copper levels are required to ensure proper growth and mental development [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] 5.3 Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency may develop following treatment with CUVRIOR, especially in menstruating or pregnant women, or as a result of the low copper diet recommended for Wilson's disease. If necessary, iron may be given in short courses, but at least two hours should elapse between administration of CUVRIOR and iron [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions, characterized by rash, have been reported with the use of trientine. In Trial 1, rash was reported in 12% (3/26) of CUVRIOR-treated patients, and one of these patients discontinued CUVRIOR because of the rash [see If a patient develops a rash or other hypersensitivity reaction during treatment with CUVRIOR, assess clinically and consider discontinuing CUVRIOR Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. [see . Contraindications (4) ]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Potential for Worsening of Clinical Symptoms at Initiation of Therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Copper Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Iron Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are abdominal pain, change of bowel habits, rash, alopecia, and mood swings. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Orphalan at 1-800-961-8320 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Common Adverse Reactions Table 3 presents common adverse reactions over a 24-week period from Trial 1, a prospective, randomized, multi-center study that was conducted in adult patients with Wilson's disease who were de-coppered and tolerant to penicillamine [see . Patients were either switched to receive CUVRIOR (N=26) or continued to receive penicillamine (N=27). Clinical Studies (14) ] Table 3: Common Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions that occurred in >5% of CUVRIOR-treated patients and greater than in patients who continued to receive penicillamine. from a Clinical Study of CUVRIOR in Adult Patients with Wilson's Disease (Trial 1) Adverse Reaction CUVRIOR (N=26) n (%) Penicillamine (N=27) n (%) Abdominal pain Abdominal pain is composed of several similar terms 5 (19%) 1 (4%) Change of bowel habits Includes constipation, abnormal feces, soft feces 4 (15%) 0 Rash Rash is composed of several similar terms 3 (12%) 0 Alopecia 2 (8%) 1 (4%) Mood swings 2 (8%) 0 Other Adverse Reactions In Trial 1, anemia developed in 4% (1/26) of CUVRIOR-treated patients and in no patients who continued to receive penicillamine. In addition, the following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies of patients with Wilson's disease who were on therapy with trientine hydrochloride: Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Iron deficiency Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Systemic lupus erythematosus 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of trientine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: Gastrointestinal Disorders : Colitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Muscle spasms, Rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: Dystonia, Myasthenia gravis",
