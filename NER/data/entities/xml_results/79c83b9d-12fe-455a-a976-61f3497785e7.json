    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions in Elderly      Patients with Dementia- Related Psychosis: Increased incidence of cerebrovascular      adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack) ( 5.3 ). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Manage with immediate discontinuation and      close monitoring ( 5.4 ). Tardive Dyskinesia: Discontinue if clinically appropriate ( 5.5 ). Metabolic Changes: Monitor for hyperglycemia/diabetes      mellitus, dyslipidemia and weight gain ( 5.6 ). Hyperprolactinemia: Prolactin elevations may occur ( 5.7 ). Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and      Agranulocytosis: Perform      complete blood counts (CBC) in patients with a pre-existing low white      blood cell count (WBC) or a history of leukopenia or neutropenia. Consider      discontinuing lurasidone hydrochloride if a clinically significant decline      in WBC occurs in the absence of other causative factors ( 5.8 ). Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope:Monitor      heart rate and blood pressure and warn patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease,      and risk of dehydration or syncope ( 5.9 ). 5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6- to 1.7-times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Lurasidone hydrochloride is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see . Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] 5.2 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients, and over 4,400 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients was greater in antidepressant-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. The drug- placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2. No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric studies. There were suicides in the adult studies, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about antidepressant drug effect on suicide. Table 2: Risk Differences of the Number of Cases of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional patients 18 to 24 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer patient \u226565 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric and young adult patients extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance studies in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing lurasidone hydrochloride, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis In placebo-controlled trials with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine in elderly subjects with dementia, there was a higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks), including fatalities, compared to placebo-treated subjects. Lurasidone hydrochloride is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including lurasidone hydrochloride. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue lurasidone hydrochloride and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring. 5.5 Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements that can develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses or may even arise after discontinuation of treatment. The syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, lurasidone hydrochloride should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on lurasidone hydrochloride, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with lurasidone hydrochloride despite the presence of the syndrome. 5.6 Metabolic Changes Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and body weight gain. While all of the drugs in the class have been shown to produce some metabolic changes, each drug has its own specific risk profile. Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Mellitus Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the general population. Given these confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti-diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.

Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years): In studies of pediatric patients 10 to 17 years and adults with bipolar depression, changes in fasting glucose were similar. In the 6-week, placebo-controlled study of pediatric patients with bipolar depression, mean change in fasting glucose was +1.6 mg/dL for Lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 80 mg/day (n=145) and -0.5 mg/dL for placebo (n=145). Pediatric Patients (6 to 17 years): In a 104-week, open-label study in pediatric patients with schizophrenia, bipolar depression, or autistic disorder, 7 % of patients with a normal baseline fasting glucose experienced a shift to high at endpoint while taking lurasidone. Dyslipidemia Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics.

Of patients with normal baseline fasting triglycerides, 12% experienced shifts to high. Weight Gain Weight gain has been observed with atypical antipsychotic use. Clinical monitoring of weight is recommended. Schizophrenia: Adults Pooled data from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies are presented in Table 9. The mean weight gain was +0.43 kg for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients compared to -0.02 kg for placebo-treated patients. Change in weight from baseline for olanzapine was +4.15 kg and for quetiapine extended-release was +2.09 kg in Studies 3 and 5 [see Clinical Studies ( , respectively. The proportion of patients with a \u22657% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 4.8% for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients and 3.3% for placebo-treated patients. 14.1 )] Table 9: Mean Change in Weight (kg) from Baseline in Adult Schizophrenia Studies Lurasidone Hydrochloride Placebo (n=696) 20 mg/day (n=71) 40 mg/day (n=484) 80 mg/day (n=526) 120 mg/day (n=291) 160 mg/day (n=114) All Patients -0.02 -0.15 +0.22 +0.54 +0.68 +0.60 In the uncontrolled, longer-term schizophrenia studies (primarily open-label extension studies), lurasidone hydrochloride was associated with a mean change in weight of -0.69 kg at week 24 (n=755), -0.59 kg at week 36 (n=443) and -0.73 kg at week 52 (n=377).

Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate Data from the adult short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies are presented in Table 12. The mean change in weight gain was +0.11 kg for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients compared to +0.16 kg for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients with a \u22657% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 3.1% for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients and 0.3% for placebo-treated patients.

Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years): Data from the 6-week, placebo-controlled bipolar depression study in patients 10 to 17 years are presented in Table 13. The mean change in weight gain was +0.7 kg for lurasidone hydrochloride treated patients compared to +0.5 kg for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients with a \u22657% increase in body weight (at Endpoint) was 4.0% for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients and 5.3% for placebo-treated patients. Table 13: Mean Change in Weight (kg) from Baseline in the Bipolar Depression Study in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years) Lurasidone Hydrochloride Placebo (n=170) 20 to 80 mg/day (n=175) All Patients +0.5 +0.7 Pediatric Patients (6 to 17 years): In a long-term, open-label study that enrolled pediatric patients with schizophrenia, bipolar depression, or autistic disorder from three short-term, placebo-controlled trials, 54% (378/701) received lurasidone for 104 weeks. The mean increase in weight from open-label baseline to Week 104 was 5.85 kg. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]), which normalize for the natural growth of children and adolescents by comparisons to age- and sex-matched population standards. A z-score change <0.5 SD is considered not clinically significant. In this trial, the mean change in z-score from open-label baseline to Week 104 was -0.06 SD for body weight and -0.13 SD for body mass index (BMI), indicating minimal deviation from the normal curve for weight gain. 5.7 Hyperprolactinemia As with other drugs that antagonize dopamine D 2 receptors, lurasidone hydrochloride elevates prolactin levels. Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic GnRH, resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotrophin secretion. This, in turn, may inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both female and male patients. Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevating compounds. Long-standing hyperprolactinemia, when associated with hypogonadism, may lead to decreased bone density in both female and male patients [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6 )] Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro , a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is considered in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. As is common with compounds which increase prolactin release, an increase in mammary gland neoplasia was observed in a carcinogenicity study conducted with lurasidone in rats and mice [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans, but the available evidence is too limited to be conclusive. 13 )]. Schizophrenia Adults: In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients was +0.4 ng/mL and was -1.9 ng/mL in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +0.5 ng/mL and for females was -0.2 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin by dose are shown in Table 14.

The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations \u22655x ULN was 1.6% and 0.6% for placebo-treated male patients. In the uncontrolled longer-term schizophrenia studies (primarily open-label extension studies), lurasidone hydrochloride was associated with a median change in prolactin of -0.9 ng/mL at week 24 (n=357), -5.3 ng/mL at week 36 (n=190) and -2.2 ng/mL at week 52 (n=307). Adolescents In the short-term, placebo-controlled adolescent schizophrenia study, the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients was +1.1 ng/mL and was +0.1 ng/mL for placebo-treated patients. For lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients, the median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +1.0 ng/mL and for females was +2.6 ng/mL.

Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate: The median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels, in the adult short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies was +2.8 ng/mL with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 120 mg/day compared to 0.0 ng/mL with placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +2.4 ng/mL and for females was +3.2 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin across the dose range are shown in Table 17. Table 17: Median Change in Prolactin (ng/mL) from Baseline in the Adult Adjunctive Therapy Bipolar Depression Studies Patients were randomized to flexibly dosed lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 120 mg/day or placebo as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.

The proportion of male patients with prolactin elevations \u22655x ULN was 0% and 0% for placebo-treated male patients. In the uncontrolled, open-label, longer-term bipolar depression study, patients who were treated with lurasidone hydrochloride, as adjunctive therapy with either lithium or valproate, in the short-term and continued in the longer-term study, had a median change in prolactin of -2.9 ng/mL at week 24 (n=88). Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years): In the 6-week, placebo-controlled bipolar depression study with pediatric patients 10 to 17 years, the median change from baseline to endpoint in prolactin levels for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients was +1.10 ng/mL and was +0.50 ng/mL for placebo-treated patients. For Lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients, the median change from baseline to endpoint for males was +0.85 ng/mL and for females was +2.50 ng/mL. Median changes for prolactin are shown in Table 18. Table 18: Median Change in Prolactin (ng/mL) from Baseline in the Bipolar Depression Study in Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years) Placebo Lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 80 mg/day All Patients +0.50 (n=157) +1.10 (n=165) Females +0.55 (n=78) +2.50 (n=83) Males +0.50 (n=79) +0.85 (n=82) The proportion of patients with prolactin elevations \u22655x ULN was 0% for lurasidone hydrochloride -treated patients and 0.6% for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of female patients with prolactin elevations \u22655x ULN was 0% for lurasidone hydrochloride -treated patients and 1.3% for placebo-treated female patients. No male patients in the placebo or lurasidone hydrochloride treatment groups had prolactin elevations \u22655x ULN. Pediatric Patients (6 to 17 years): In a 104-week, open-label study of pediatric patients with schizophrenia, bipolar depression, or autistic disorder, the median changes from baseline to endpoint in serum prolactin levels were - 0.20 ng/mL (all patients), -0.30 ng/mL (females), and -0.05 ng/mL (males). The proportions of patients with a markedly high prolactin level (\u22655 times the upper limit of normal) at any time during open-label treatment were 2% (all patients), 3% (females), and 1% (males). Adverse events among females in this trial that are potentially prolactin-related include galactorrhea (0.6%). Among male patients in this study, decreased libido was reported in one patient (0.2%) and there were no reports of impotence, gynecomastia, or galactorrhea. 5.8 Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Leukopenia/neutropenia has been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with other agents in the class. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and lurasidone hydrochloride should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue lurasidone hydrochloride and have their WBC followed until recovery. 5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope Lurasidone hydrochloride may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-na\u00efve. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: \u2265 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and \u226510 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position. Schizophrenia Adults: The incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was (lurasidone hydrochloride incidence, placebo incidence): orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508), 0.1% (1/708)] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508), 0% (0/708)]. In short-term schizophrenia clinical studies, orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.8% with lurasidone hydrochloride 40 mg, 2.1% with lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg, 1.7% with lurasidone hydrochloride 120 mg and 0.8% with lurasidone hydrochloride 160 mg compared to 0.7% with placebo. Adolescents: The incidence of orthostatic hypotension reported as adverse events from the short-term, placebo-controlled adolescent schizophrenia study was 0.5% (1/214) in lurasidone hydrochloride -treated patients and 0% (0/112) in placebo-treated patients. No syncope event was reported. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0% with lurasidone hydrochloride 40 mg and 2.9% with lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg, compared to 1.8% with placebo. Bipolar Depression Adults: Monotherapy In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 0.6% with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 60 mg and 0.6% with lurasidone hydrochloride 80 to 120 mg compared to 0% with placebo. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression therapy studies, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 1.1% with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 120 mg compared to 0.9% with placebo. Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years): In the 6-week, placebo-controlled bipolar depression study in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years, there were no reported adverse events of orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital signs, occurred with a frequency of 1.1% with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 80 mg/day, compared to 0.6% with placebo. 5.10 Falls Lurasidone hydrochloride may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy. 5.11 Seizures As with other antipsychotic drugs, lurasidone hydrochloride should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in patients 65 years or older. Schizophrenia In adult short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, seizures/convulsions occurred in 0.1% (2/1508) of patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride compared to 0.1% (1/708) placebo-treated patients. Bipolar Depression Monotherapy: In the adult and pediatric 6-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression studies, no patients experienced seizures/convulsions. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate: In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, no patient experienced seizures/convulsions. 5.12 Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment Lurasidone hydrochloride, like other antipsychotics, has the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. Caution patients about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that therapy with lurasidone hydrochloride does not affect them adversely. In clinical studies with lurasidone hydrochloride, somnolence included: hypersomnia, hypersomnolence, sedation and somnolence. Schizophrenia Adults: In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies, somnolence was reported by 17.0% (256/1508) of patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride (15.5% lurasidone hydrochloride 20 mg, 15.6% lurasidone hydrochloride 40 mg, 15.2% lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg, 26.5% lurasidone hydrochloride 120 mg and 8.3% lurasidone hydrochloride 160 mg/day) compared to 7.1% (50/708) of placebo patients. Adolescents: In the short-term, placebo-controlled adolescent schizophrenia study, somnolence was reported by 14.5% (31/214) of patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride (15.5% lurasidone hydrochloride 40 mg and 13.5% Lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg,/day) compared to 7.1% (8/112) of placebo patients. Bipolar Depression Adults: Monotherapy In the adult short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, somnolence was reported by 7.3% (12/164) and 13.8% (23/167) with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 60 mg and 80 to120 mg, respectively compared to 6.5% (11/168) of placebo patients. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate In the adult short-term, flexible-dosed, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, somnolence was reported by 11.4% (41/360) of patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to120 mg compared to 5.1% (17/334) of placebo patients. Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years): In the 6-week, placebo-controlled bipolar depression study in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years, somnolence was reported by 11.4% (20/175) of patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 80 mg/day compared to 5.8% (10/172) of placebo treated patients. 5.13 Body Temperature Dysregulation Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing lurasidone hydrochloride for patients who will be experiencing conditions that may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration . 5.14 Activation of Mania/Hypomania Antidepressant treatment can increase the risk of developing a manic or hypomanic episode, particularly in patients with bipolar disorder. Monitor patients for the emergence of such episodes. In the adult bipolar depression monotherapy and adjunctive therapy (with lithium or valproate) studies, less than 1% of subjects in the lurasidone hydrochloride and placebo groups developed manic or hypomanic episodes. 5.15 Dysphagia Esophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use. Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients, in particular those with advanced Alzheimer's dementia. Lurasidone hydrochloride and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. 5.16 Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson\u2019s Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, extrapyramidal symptoms, and clinical features consistent with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.",

Adults The information below is derived from an integrated clinical study database for lurasidone hydrochloride consisting of 3799 adult patients exposed to one or more doses of lurasidone hydrochloride for the treatment of schizophrenia, and bipolar depression in placebo-controlled studies. This experience corresponds with a total experience of 1250.9 patient-years. A total of 1106 lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients had at least 24 weeks and 371 lurasidone hydrochloride -treated patients had at least 52 weeks of exposure. Adverse events during exposure to study treatment were obtained by general inquiry and voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results from physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, weights and laboratory investigations. Adverse experiences were recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. In order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology. Schizophrenia The following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing adult studies for schizophrenia in which lurasidone hydrochloride was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 160 mg (n=1508). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions : The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride were somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea. A total of 9.5% (143/1508) lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients and 9.3% (66/708) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with lurasidone hydrochloride that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment: Adverse reactions associated with the use of lurasidone hydrochloride (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and lurasidone hydrochloride incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with schizophrenia) are shown in Table 19. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in Lurasidone Hydrochloride-Treated Patients: Table 19: Adverse Reactions in 2% or More of Lurasidone Hydrochloride-Treated Patients and That Occurred at Greater Incidence than in the Placebo-Treated Patients in Adult Short-term Schizophrenia Studies Note: Figures rounded to the nearest integer Percentage of Patients Reporting Reaction Lurasidone Hydrochloride Body System or Organ Class Placebo (N=708) (%) 20 mg/day (N=71) (%) 40 mg/day (N=487) (%) 80 mg/day (N=538) (%) 120 mg/day (N=291) (%) 160 mg/day (N=121) (%) All Lurasidone Hydrochloride (N=1508) (%) Gastrointestinal Disorders Nausea 5 11 10 9 13 7 10 Vomiting 6 7 6 9 9 7 8 Dyspepsia 5 11 6 5 8 6 6 Salivary <1 1 1 2 4 2 2 Hypersecretion Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Back Pain 2 0 4 3 4 0 3 Nervous System Disorders Somnolence Somnolence includes adverse event terms: hypersomnia, hypersomnolence, sedation, and somnolence 7 15 16 15 26 8 17 Akathisia 3 6 11 12 22 7 13 Extrapyramidal Disorder Extrapyramidal symptoms include adverse event terms: bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, drooling, dystonia, extrapyramidal disorder, hypokinesia, muscle rigidity, oculogyric crisis, oromandibular dystonia, parkinsonism, psychomotor retardation, tongue spasm, torticollis, tremor, and trismus 6 6 11 12 22 13 14 Dizziness 2 6 4 4 5 6 4 Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 8 8 10 11 9 7 10 Agitation 4 10 7 3 6 5 5 Anxiety 4 3 6 4 7 3 5 Restlessness 1 1 3 1 3 2 2 Dose-Related Adverse Reactions in the Schizophrenia Studies Akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms were dose-related.

Akathisia was reported by 7.4% (9/121) of patients receiving 160 mg/day. Akathisia occurred in 3.0% of subjects receiving placebo. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms increased with dose up to 120 mg/day (5.6% for lurasidone hydrochloride 20 mg, 11.5% for lurasidone hydrochloride 40 mg, 11.9% for lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg, and 22.0% for lurasidone hydrochloride 120 mg). Bipolar Depression (Monotherapy) The following findings are based on the adult short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing study for bipolar depression in which lurasidone hydrochloride was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg (n=331). The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655%, in either dose group, and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride were akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anxiety. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions: A total of 6.0% (20/331) lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients and 5.4% (9/168) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions.

Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years) The mean change from baseline for lurasidone hydrochloride - treated pediatric patients 10 to 17 years with bipolar depression for the SAS, BAS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients and placebo for the BAS (lurasidone hydrochloride, 4.6%; placebo, 2.4%), the SAS (lurasidone hydrochloride, 0.6%; placebo, 0%) and was the same for the AIMS (lurasidone hydrochloride, 0%; placebo, 0%). Dystonia: Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Schizophrenia: Adults In the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia clinical studies, dystonia occurred in 4.2% of lurasidone hydrochloride-treated subjects (0.0% lurasidone hydrochloride 20 mg, 3.5% lurasidone hydrochloride 40 mg, 4.5% lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg, 6.5% lurasidone hydrochloride 120 mg and 2.5% lurasidone hydrochloride 160 mg) compared to 0.8% of subjects receiving placebo. Seven subjects (0.5%, 7/1508) discontinued clinical trials due to dystonic events \u2013 four were receiving lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg/day and three were receiving lurasidone hydrochloride 120 mg/day. Adolescents In the short-term, placebo-controlled, adolescent schizophrenia study, dystonia occurred in 1% of lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients (1% lurasidone hydrochloride 40 mg and 1% Lurasidone hydrochloride 80 mg) compared to 0% of patients receiving placebo. No patients discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events. Bipolar Depression: Adults Monotherapy: In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, dystonia occurred in 0.9% of lurasidone hydrochloride-treated subjects (0.0% and 1.8% for lurasidone hydrochloride 20 to 60 mg/day and lurasidone hydrochloride 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively) compared to 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo. No subject discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate: In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, dystonia occurred in 1.1% of lurasidone hydrochloride-treated subjects (20 to 120 mg) compared to 0.6% of subjects receiving placebo. No subject discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events. Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years) In the 6-week, placebo-controlled bipolar depression study in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years, dystonia occurred in 0.6% of lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients compared to 1.2% of patients receiving placebo. No patients discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Lurasidone Hydrochloride: Following is a list of adverse reactions reported by adult patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride at multiple doses of \u2265 20 mg once daily within the premarketing database of 2905 patients with schizophrenia. The reactions listed are those that could be of clinical importance, as well as reactions that are plausibly drug-related on pharmacologic or other grounds. Reactions listed in Table 19 or those that appear elsewhere in the lurasidone hydrochloride label are not included. Reactions are further categorized by organ class and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (frequent) (only those not already listed in the tabulated results from placebo-controlled studies appear in this listing); those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients (infrequent); and those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients (rare). Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Infrequent: anemia Cardiac Disorders: Frequent: tachycardia; Infrequent: AV block 1st degree, angina pectoris, bradycardia Ear and Labyrinth Disorders: Infrequent: vertigo Eye Disorders: Frequent: blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders: Frequent: abdominal pain, diarrhea; Infrequent: gastritis General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions: Rare: sudden death Investigations: Frequent: CPK increased Metabolism and Nutritional System Disorders: Frequent: decreased appetite Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rare: rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: Infrequent: cerebrovascular accident, dysarthria Psychiatric Disorders: Infrequent: abnormal dreams, panic attack, sleep disorder Renal and Urinary Disorders: Infrequent: dysuria; Rare: renal failure Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: Infrequent: amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea; Rare: breast enlargement, breast pain, galactorrhea, erectile dysfunction, priapism Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Frequent: rash, pruritus; Rare: angioedema Vascular Disorders: Frequent: hypertension Clinical Laboratory Changes Schizophrenia: Adults Serum Creatinine : In short-term, placebo-controlled trials, the mean change from Baseline in serum creatinine was +0.05 mg/dL for lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients compared to +0.02 mg/dL for placebo-treated patients. A creatinine shift from normal to high occurred in 3.0% (43/1453) of lurasidone hydrochloride-treated patients and 1.6% (11/681) on placebo. The threshold for high creatinine value varied from > 0.79 to > 1.3 mg/dL based on the centralized laboratory definition for each study (Table 29).
