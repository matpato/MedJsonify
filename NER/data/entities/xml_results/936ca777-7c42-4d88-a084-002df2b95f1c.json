( 2.3 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Myelosuppression: Monitor blood counts and manage as necessary. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Toxicity: Monitor liver enzymes at least monthly for the first 3 months and as needed. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.3 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Cardiovascular Toxicity: Monitor and manage as necessary. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Fluid Retention: Monitor patients and manage using standard of care treatment. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF. ( 2.3 , 5.5 ) \u2022 Renal Toxicity: Monitor patients for renal function at baseline and during therapy with BOSULIF. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: BOSULIF can cause fetal harm. Advise female patients of reproductive potential of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Gastrointestinal Toxicity Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain occur with BOSULIF treatment. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, and fluid replacement. In the randomized clinical trial in adult patients with newly-diagnosed Ph+ CML, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 4 days and the median duration per event was 3 days. Among 546 adult patients in a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 2 days and the median duration per event was 2 days. Among the patients who experienced diarrhea, the median number of episodes of diarrhea per patient during treatment with BOSULIF was 3 (range 1\u2013268). Among 49 pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or who had CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the median time to onset for diarrhea (all grades) was 2 days and the duration was 2 days. Among patients who experienced diarrhea, the median number of episodes of diarrhea per patient during treatment with BOSULIF was 2 (range 1 \u2013 198). To manage gastrointestinal toxicity, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] 5.2 Myelosuppression Thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia occur with BOSULIF treatment. Perform complete blood counts weekly for the first month of therapy and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. To manage myelosuppression, withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] 5.3 Hepatic Toxicity Bosutinib may cause elevations in serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). Two cases consistent with drug induced liver injury (defined as concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than or equal to 3\u00d7ULN with total bilirubin greater than 2\u00d7ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2\u00d7ULN) have occurred without alternative causes. This represented 2 out 1711 patients in BOSULIF clinical trials. In the 268 adult patients from the safety population in the randomized clinical trial in patients with newly-diagnosed CML in the BOSULIF treatment group, the incidence of ALT elevation was 68.3% and increased AST was 56%. Of patients who experienced increased transaminases of any grade, 73% experienced their first increase within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 29 and 56 days, respectively, and the median duration was 19 and 15 days, respectively. Among the 546 adult patients in a single-arm study in patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the incidence of increased ALT was 53.3% and AST elevation was 46.7%. Sixty percent of the patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Most cases of transaminase elevations in this study occurred early in treatment; of patients who experienced increased transaminases of any grade, more than 81% experienced their first increase within the first 3 months. The median time to onset of increased ALT and AST was 22 and 29 days, respectively, and the median duration for each was 21 days. Among 49 pediatric patients with newly\u2011diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or who had CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, the incidence based on laboratory data that worsened from baseline of increased ALT was 59% and of increased AST 51%. Seventy-six percent of the patients experienced an increase in either ALT or AST. Most cases of increased transaminases occurred early in treatment; of patients who experienced increased transaminases of any grade, 84% of patients experienced their first increases within the first 3 months. The median time to onset for adverse reactions of increased ALT and AST was 22 and 15 days, respectively. The median duration for adverse reactions of Grade 3 or 4 increased ALT or AST was 26 and 12 days, respectively. Perform hepatic enzyme tests monthly for the first 3 months of BOSULIF treatment and as clinically indicated. In patients with transaminase elevations, monitor liver enzymes more frequently. Withhold, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] 5.4 Cardiovascular Toxicity BOSULIF can cause cardiovascular toxicity including cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac ischemic events. Cardiac failure events occurred more frequently in previously treated patients than in patients with newly diagnosed CML and were more frequent in patients with advanced age or risk factors, including previous medical history of cardiac failure. Cardiac ischemic events occurred in both previously treated patients and in patients with newly diagnosed CML and were more common in patients with coronary artery disease risk factors, including history of diabetes, body mass index greater than 30, hypertension, and vascular disorders. In a randomized study of adult patients with newly diagnosed CML, cardiac failure occurred in 1.9% of patients treated with BOSULIF compared to 0.8% of patients treated with imatinib. Cardiac ischemic events occurred in 4.9% of patients treated with BOSULIF compared to 0.8% of patients treated with imatinib. In a single-arm study in adult patients with CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, cardiac failure was observed in 5.3% of patients and cardiac ischemic events were observed in 5.1% of patients treated with BOSULIF. Among 49 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or who had CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, 4 (8%) patients had Grade 1-2 cardiac events, including tachycardia (n=2), angina pectoris, right bundle branch block, and sinus tachycardia (n=1 each). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac failure and cardiac ischemia and treat as clinically indicated. Interrupt, dose reduce, or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] 5.5 Fluid Retention Fluid retention occurs with BOSULIF and may manifest as pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and/or peripheral edema. In the randomized clinical trial of 268 adult patients with newly-diagnosed CML in the bosutinib treatment group, 3 patients (1.1%) experienced severe fluid retention of Grade 3, 1 patient experienced Grade 3 pericardial effusion, and 2 patients experienced Grade 3 pleural effusion. Among 546 adult patients in a single-arm study in patients with Ph+ CML who were resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, Grade 3 or 4 fluid retention was reported in 30 patients (6%). Some patients experienced more than one fluid retention event. Specifically, 24 patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 pleural effusions, 9 patients experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 pericardial effusions, and 6 patients experienced Grade 3 edema. Among 49 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or who had CP Ph+ CML that was resistant or intolerant to prior therapy, Grade 1-2 pericardial effusion, peripheral edema, and face edema were reported in 1 patient each. Monitor and manage patients using standards of care. Interrupt, dose reduce or discontinue BOSULIF as necessary [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] 5.6 Renal Toxicity An on-treatment decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has occurred in patients treated with BOSULIF. Table 6 identifies the shift from baseline to lowest observed eGFR during BOSULIF therapy for patients in the pooled leukemia studies regardless of line of therapy. The median duration of therapy with BOSULIF was approximately 24 months (range, 0.03 to 155) for patients in these studies. Table 6: Shift From Baseline to Lowest Observed eGFR Group During Treatment Safety Population in Clinical Studies (N=1372) Among the 1372 patients, eGFR was missing in 7 patients at baseline or on-therapy. There were no patients with kidney failure at baseline. Baseline Follow-Up Abbreviations: eGFR=estimated glomerular filtration rate; N/n=number of patients. Notes: eGFR was calculated using Modification in Diet in Renal Disease method (MDRD). Notes: Grading is based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Classification by eGFR: Normal: greater than or equal to 90, Mild: 60 to less than 90, Mild to Moderate: 45 to less than 60, Moderate to Severe: 30 to less than 45, Severe: 15 to less than 30, Kidney Failure: less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 .

Monitor renal function at baseline and during therapy with BOSULIF, with particular attention to those patients who have preexisting renal impairment or risk factors for renal dysfunction. Consider dose adjustment in patients with baseline and treatment emergent renal impairment [see . Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] 5.7 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, BOSULIF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies conducted in rats and rabbits, oral administration of bosutinib during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes, including structural abnormalities, embryo-fetal mortality, and alterations to growth at maternal exposures (AUC) as low as 1.2 times the human exposure at the dose of 500 mg/day. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ]",

They represent an evaluation of the adverse reaction data from all 1372 patients with leukemia who received at least 1 dose of single-agent BOSULIF. These adverse reactions are presented by system organ class and are ranked by frequency. These adverse reactions are included based on clinical relevance and ranked in order of decreasing seriousness within each category. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : 0.1% and less than 1% - Febrile neutropenia Cardiac Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Cardiac ischemia (includes Acute coronary syndrome, Acute myocardial infarction, Angina pectoris, Angina unstable, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, Coronary artery disease, Coronary artery occlusion, Coronary artery stenosis, Myocardial infarction, Myocardial ischemia, Troponin increased), Pericardial effusion, Cardiac failure (includes Cardiac failure, Cardiac failure acute, Cardiac failure chronic, Cardiac failure congestive, Cardiogenic shock, Cardiorenal syndrome, Ejection fraction decreased, Left ventricular failure); 0.1% and less than 1% - Pericarditis Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Tinnitus Endocrine Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Hypothyroidism; 0.1% and less than 1% - Hyperthyroidism Gastrointestinal Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Gastritis, Pancreatitis (includes Edematous pancreatitis, Pancreatic enzymes increased, Pancreatitis, Pancreatitis acute, Pancreatitis chronic), Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (includes Anal hemorrhage, Gastric hemorrhage, Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, Intestinal hemorrhage, Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, Rectal hemorrhage, Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage) General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions : 1% and less than 10% - Pain Immune System Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Drug hypersensitivity; 0.1% and less than 1% - Anaphylactic shock Infections and Infestations : 1% and less than 10% - Bronchitis Investigations : 1% and less than 10% - Electrocardiogram QT prolonged (includes Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, Long QT syndrome) Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Dehydration Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Myalgia Nervous System Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Dysgeusia Renal and Urinary Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Acute kidney injury, Renal impairment, Renal failure Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : 1% and less than 10% - Pulmonary hypertension (includes Pulmonary hypertension, Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Pulmonary arterial pressure increased); 0.1% and less than 1% - Acute pulmonary edema (includes Acute pulmonary edema, Pulmonary edema), Interstitial lung disease, Respiratory failure Skin and Subcutaneous Disorders : 0.1% and less than 1% - Erythema multiforme 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of BOSULIF. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
