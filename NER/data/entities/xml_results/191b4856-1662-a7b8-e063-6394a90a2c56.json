    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis: Risk factors include age 65 or greater, renal impairment, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher doses of pitavastatin tablets. Discontinue pitavastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue pitavastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the pitavastatin tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever ( 5.1 , 7 , 8.5 , 8.6 ) . Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy ( IMNM ) : Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported. Discontinue pitavastatin tablets if IMNM is suspected ( 5.2 ) . Hepatic Dysfunction: Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzyme before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue pitavastatin tablets ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Pitavastatin tablets may cause myopathy ( muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase [CK] ) and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with statin, including pitavastatin tablets. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs ( including other lipidlowering therapies ) , and higher pitavastatin tablets dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 ) ] . Dosages of pitavastatin tablets greater than 4 mg once daily were associated with an increased risk for severe myopathy in premarketing clinical studies. The maximum recommended dose of pitavastatin tablets is 4 mg once daily . Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Pitavastatin tablets are contraindicated in patients taking cyclosporine and not recommended in patients taking gemfibrozil [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . There are pitavastatin tablets dosage restrictions for patients taking erythromycin or rifampin [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] . The following drugs when used concomitantly with pitavastatin tablets may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: lipid-modifying dosages of niacin ( >1 grams/day ) , fibrates, and colchicine [see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] . Discontinue pitavastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if pitavastatin tablets are discontinued. Temporarily discontinue pitavastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, ( e.g. , sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy ) . Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the pitavastatin tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy ( IMNM ) , an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue pitavastatin tablets if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with pitavastatin tablets [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including pitavastatin tablets. Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury. Consider liver enzyme testing before the initiation of pitavastatin tablets and when clinically indicated thereafter. Pitavastatin tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue pitavastatin tablets. 5.4 Increases in HbA1 c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1 c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including pitavastatin tablets. Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Increases in HbA1 c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] . The most frequent adverse reactions ( rate \u22652% ) were myalgia, constipation, back pain, diarrhea, and pain in extremity.

Adverse Reactions in Adults with Primary Hyperlipidemia In 10 controlled clinical studies and 4 subsequent open-label extension studies, 3.291 adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia were administered pitavastatin tablets 1 mg to 4 mg daily. The mean continuous exposure of pitavastatin ( 1 mg to 4 mg ) was 36.7 weeks ( median 51.1 weeks ) . The mean age of the patients was 60.9 years ( range; 18 years \u2013 89 years ) and 52% were females. Approximately 93% of the patients were White, 7% were Asian/Indian, 0.2% were African American and 0.3% were Hispanic and other. In controlled clinical studies and their open-label extensions, 3.9% ( 1 mg ) , 3.3% ( 2 mg ) , and 3.7% ( 4 mg ) of pitavastatin tablets -treated patients were discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: elevated creatine phosphokinase ( 0.6% on 4 mg ) and myalgia ( 0.5% on 4 mg ) . Adverse reactions reported in \u2265 2% of patients in controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than or equal to placebo are shown in Table 1. These studies had treatment duration of up to 12 weeks. Table 1. Adverse Reactions ( \u2265 2% and \u2265 placebo ) in Adults with Primary Hyperlipidemia in Studies up to 12 Weeks Adverse Reactions Placebo ( n= 208 ) % Pitavastatin Tablets 1 mg ( n=309 ) % Pitavastatin Tablets 2 mg ( n=951 ) % Pitavastatin Tablets 4 mg ( n=1540 ) % Myalgia 1.4 1.9 2.8 3.1 Constipation 1.9 3.6 1.5 2.2 Diarrhea 1.9 2.6 1.5 1.9 Back Pain 2.9 3.9 1.8 1.4 Pain in extremity 1.9 2.3 0.6 0.9 Other adverse reactions reported from clinical studies were arthralgia, headache, influenza, and nasopharyngitis. Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, and urticaria have been reported with Pitavastatin tablets. The following laboratory abnormalities have been reported: elevated creatine phosphokinase, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and glucose. Adverse Reactions in Adult HIV-Infected Patients with Dyslipidemia In a double-blind, randomized, controlled, 52-week trial, 252 HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia were treated with either pitavastatin tablets 4 mg once daily ( n=126 ) or another statin ( n=126 ) . All patients were taking antiretroviral therapy ( excluding darunavir ) and had HIV-1 RNA less than 200 copies/mL and CD4 count greater than 200 cell/\u03bcL for at least 3 months prior to randomization. The safety profile of pitavastatin tablets was generally consistent with that observed in the clinical trials described above. One patient ( 0.8% ) treated with pitavastatin tablets had a peak creatine phosphokinase value exceeding 10 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , which resolved spontaneously. Four patients ( 3% ) treated with pitavastatin tablets had at least one ALT value exceeding 3 times but less than 5 times the ULN, none of which led to drug discontinuation. Virologic failure was reported for four patients ( 3% ) treated with pitavastatin tablets, defined as a confirmed measurement of HIV-1 RNA exceeding 200 copies/mL that was also more than a 2-fold increase from baseline. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients Aged 8 Years and Older with HeFH In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pitavastain tablets 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg once daily in 82 pediatric patients 8 years to 16 years of age with HeFH and a 52-week open-label trial in 85 pediatric patients with HeFH, the safety profile was similar to that observed in the adult population. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pitavastatin tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea General disorders: asthenia, fatigue, malaise, dizziness Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatitis, jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Immune system disorders: angioedema, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: increases in HbA1 c, fasting serum glucose levels Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: muscle spasms, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis Nervous system disorders: hypoesthesia, peripheral neuropathy.There have been rare reports of new onset or exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, including ocular myasthenia, and reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. Rare reports of cognitive impairment ( e.g. , memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion ) associated with statin use. Cognitive impairment was generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset ( 1 day to years ) and symptom resolution ( median of 3 weeks ) . Psychiatric disorders: insomnia, depression. Reproductive system and breast disorders: erectile dysfunction Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: interstitial lung disease Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: lichen planus",
