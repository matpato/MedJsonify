    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune reconstitution syndrome:  May necessitate further evaluation and treatment. ( 5.2 ) Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) before or when initiating EMTRIVA [see . Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensation and liver failure) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and have discontinued EMTRIVA. Patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV who discontinue EMTRIVA should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure. 5.2\tImmune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including EMTRIVA. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment. 5.3\tLactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs, including FTC, alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Treatment with EMTRIVA should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity (which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations). 5.4\tDose Adjustment in Patients with New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine is principally eliminated by the kidney. Reduction of the dosage of EMTRIVA is recommended for patients with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226510%) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, rash, abdominal pain, asthenia, increased cough, and rhinitis.  Skin hyperpigmentation was very common (\u226510%) in pediatric patients. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in Adults More than 2,000 adult subjects with HIV-1 infection have been treated with EMTRIVA alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents for periods of 10 days to 200 weeks in clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, any severity) identified from any of the three large, controlled clinical trials include headache, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, rash, abdominal pain, asthenia, increased cough, and rhinitis. In Trials 301A and 303, the most common adverse reactions that occurred in subjects receiving EMTRIVA with other antiretroviral agents were headache, diarrhea, nausea, and rash, which were generally mild to moderate. Approximately 1% of subjects discontinued participation in the clinical trials due to these events. All adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in EMTRIVA and control treatment groups except for skin discoloration, which was reported with higher frequency in the EMTRIVA-treated group. Skin discoloration, manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms or soles, was generally mild and asymptomatic. The mechanism and clinical significance are unknown. A summary of EMTRIVA treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions in Trials 301A and 303 is provided in Table 2.

The adverse reaction profile in pediatric subjects was generally comparable to that observed in clinical trials of EMTRIVA in adult subjects [see . Hyperpigmentation was more frequent in children. Additional adverse reactions identified from this trial include anemia. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Selected treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of causality, reported in subjects during 48 weeks of treatment were the following: infection (44%), hyperpigmentation (32%), increased cough (28%), vomiting (23%), otitis media (23%), rash (21%), rhinitis (20%), diarrhea (20%), fever (18%), pneumonia (15%), gastroenteritis (11%), abdominal pain (10%), and anemia (7%). Treatment-emergent Grades 3\u22124 laboratory abnormalities were experienced by 9% of pediatric subjects, including elevated amylase (>2.0 \u00d7 ULN) (n=4), decreased neutrophils (<750/mm 3 ) (n=3), elevated ALT (>5 \u00d7 ULN) (n=2), elevated CPK (>4 \u00d7 ULN) (n=2) and one subject each with elevated bilirubin (>3.0 \u00d7 ULN), elevated GGT (>10 \u00d7 ULN), elevated lipase (>2.5 \u00d7 ULN), decreased hemoglobin (<7 g/dL), and decreased glucose (<40 mg/dL).",
