    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypersensitivity: Discontinue LITFULO if a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Laboratory Abnormalities: Perform ALC and platelet counts prior to LITFULO initiation. Treatment interruption or discontinuation are recommended based on ALC and platelet count abnormalities. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Vaccinations: Avoid use of live vaccines during or shortly prior to LITFULO treatment. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Serious Infections Serious infections have been reported in patients receiving LITFULO. The most frequent serious infections have been appendicitis, COVID-19 infection ( including pneumonia ) , and sepsis [see . Among opportunistic infections, multi-dermatomal herpes zoster was reported with LITFULO. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] Avoid use of LITFULO in patients with an active, serious infection. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating LITFULO in patients: \u2022 with chronic or recurrent infection \u2022 who have been exposed to TB \u2022 with a history of serious infection or an opportunistic infection \u2022 who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic TB or mycoses, or \u2022 with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection Closely monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with LITFULO. Interrupt LITFULO if a patient develops a serious or opportunistic infection. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with LITFULO should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. LITFULO may be resumed once the infection is controlled. Tuberculosis Screen patients for tuberculosis ( TB ) before starting therapy. LITFULO should not be given to patients with active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be started prior to initiating therapy with LITFULO in patients with a new diagnosis of latent TB or previously untreated latent TB. In patients with a negative latent TB test, consider anti-TB therapy before initiating treatment with LITFULO in those at high risk and consider screening patients at high risk for TB during treatment with LITFULO. Viral Reactivation Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation ( e.g. , herpes zoster ) , was reported in clinical trials [see . If a patient develops herpes zoster, consider interrupting treatment until the episode resolves. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] Screening for viral hepatitis should be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with LITFULO. Patients with evidence of HIV infection or hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from clinical trials. 5.2 Mortality In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with LITFULO. 5.3 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders Malignancies, including non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) , were observed in clinical trials of LITFULO [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients, a higher rate of malignancies ( excluding non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) ) was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. In this study, current or past smokers had an additional increased risk of overall malignancies. The risks and benefits of ritlecitinib treatment should be considered prior to initiating or continuing therapy in patients with a known malignancy other than a successfully treated NMSC or cervical cancer. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. 5.4 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events ( MACE ) In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) , and non-fatal stroke was observed with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with LITFULO, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue LITFULO in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke. 5.5 Thromboembolic Events An event of pulmonary embolism ( PE ) was reported in a patient receiving LITFULO [see . In a ritlecitinib higher dosing group, 1 patient reported an event of retinal artery occlusion. Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Avoid LITFULO in patients who may be at increased risk of thrombosis. If symptoms of thrombosis or embolism occur, patients should interrupt LITFULO and be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Serious reactions including anaphylactic reactions, urticaria and rash have been observed in patients receiving LITFULO in clinical trials. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue LITFULO and institute appropriate therapy [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] 5.7 Laboratory Abnormalities Treatment with LITFULO was associated with decreases in lymphocytes and platelets [see . Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] Prior to LITFULO initiation, perform ALC and platelet counts [see . After initiating treatment with LITFULO, treatment interruption or discontinuation are recommended based on ALC and platelet count abnormalities Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 ) ] [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ] Liver Enzyme Elevations \u2013 Treatment with LITFULO was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT \u22655 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and increases of AST \u22655 times the ULN were observed in patients in LITFULO clinical trials. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt LITFULO until this diagnosis is excluded. Creatine Phosphokinase ( CPK ) Elevations \u2013 Treatment with LITFULO was associated with increased incidence of CPK elevation compared to placebo. 5.8 Vaccinations No data are available on the response to vaccination in patients receiving LITFULO. Use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during or shortly prior to initiating treatment. Prior to initiating LITFULO, it is recommended that patients be brought up to date with all immunizations, including prophylactic herpes zoster vaccinations, in agreement with current immunization guidelines.",

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of LITFULO was evaluated in three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials and one long-term trial in subjects with alopecia areata, including alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis, who were 12 years of age and older. A total of 1628 subjects were treated with LITFULO representing 2085 subject-years of exposure. There were 1011 subjects with at least 1 year of exposure to LITFULO. In the placebo-controlled period of clinical trials in alopecia areata, a total of 668 subjects were exposed to LITFULO with 130 receiving 50 mg once daily for up to 24 weeks. The median age of subjects was 33 years, 105 ( 11.9% ) subjects were 12 to <18 years old and 22 ( 2.5% ) subjects were 65 years of age or older. The majority of subjects were White ( 70.7% ) and female ( 63.6% ) . Adverse reactions occurring at \u22651% in the treated groups and at a higher rate than placebo are presented in Table 2. A total of 2 ( 1.5% ) subjects treated with LITFULO 50 mg were discontinued from the trials due to adverse reactions. Table 2.

Overall Infections In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 24 weeks, overall infections were reported in 66 subjects ( 80.35 per 100 subject-years ) treated with placebo and 43 subjects ( 74.53 per 100 subject-years ) treated with LITFULO 50 mg. Across clinical trials, including the long-term trial, overall infections were reported in 645 subjects ( 50.71 per 100 subject-years ) treated with LITFULO 50 mg or higher. Serious Infections In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 24 weeks, 3 subjects reported serious infections across all ritlecitinib doses studied. Across clinical trials, including the long-term trial, serious infections were reported in 12 subjects ( 0.66 per 100 subject-years ) treated with LITFULO 50 mg or higher. The most common serious infections were related to appendicitis, COVID-19 infection ( including pneumonia ) , and sepsis. Herpes Zoster In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 24 weeks, herpes zoster was reported in 4 subjects across all ritlecitinib doses studied and 0 subjects treated with placebo. Across clinical trials, including the long-term trial, herpes zoster was reported in 21 subjects ( 1.17 per 100 subject-years ) treated with LITFULO 50 mg or higher. Opportunistic infections of multi-dermatomal herpes zoster were reported in 1 subject ( 0.50 per 100 subject-years ) treated with the ritlecitinib higher dose in the placebo-controlled trials and 2 subjects ( 0.1 per 100 subject-years ) treated with LITFULO 50 mg or higher in all clinical trials. Malignancy In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 24 weeks, 1 malignancy ( breast cancer ) was reported in 1 subject ( 1.33 per 100 subject-years ) treated with ritlecitinib higher dose and no malignancy was reported in subjects treated with placebo. Across clinical trials, including the long-term trial, malignancies excluding NMSC were reported in 7 subjects ( 0.37 per 100 subject-years ) treated with LITFULO 50 mg or higher. Thromboembolic Events Across clinical trials, including the long-term trial, pulmonary embolism ( PE ) was reported in 1 subject ( 0.06 per 100 subject-years ) treated with LITFULO. There was 1 report of retinal artery occlusion and 1 report of acute myocardial infarction. Urticaria In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 24 weeks, urticaria was reported in 28 subjects treated in all ritlecitinib doses studied and 3 subjects treated with placebo. The rate of urticaria was 8.23 per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with ritlecitinib 50 mg and 4.03 per 100 subject-years in subjects treated with placebo. Across clinical trials, including the long-term trial, urticaria was reported in 76 subjects treated with LITFULO 50 mg or higher. Among all subjects treated with ritlecitinib 50 mg or higher in the integrated safety analysis, the rate of urticaria was 4.10 per 100 subject-years. The median time to onset of an initial event was 8 weeks; median duration of urticaria was 7 days. Most of the cases were mild to moderate in severity. Decreased Lymphocyte Counts Across clinical trials, including the long-term trial confirmed ALC <500/mm 3 occurred in 1 subject ( <0.1% ) treated with LITFULO 50 mg. Age appeared to be a risk factor for lower ALC in subjects \u226565 years of age. Decreased Platelet Count In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 24 weeks, treatment with LITFULO was associated with a decrease in platelet count. Maximum effects on platelets were observed within 4 weeks, after which platelet count remained stable at a lower level with continued therapy. Across clinical trials, including the long-term trial, 1 subject ( <0.1% ) had a confirmed platelet count <100.000/mm 3 . No subject had a confirmed platelet count <75.000/mm 3 . Creatine Phosphokinase ( CPK ) Elevations In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 24 weeks, events of blood CPK increased were reported in 2 ( 1.5% ) subjects treated with LITFULO 50 mg and 0 subjects treated with placebo. Liver Enzyme Elevations In the placebo-controlled trials, for up to 24 weeks, events of increases in liver enzymes \u22653 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) were observed in subjects treated with LITFULO [see .
