Advise patients to contact a healthcare provider for symptoms of hypocalcemia [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 , 6.2 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. An increased risk of hypocalcemia has been observed in clinical trials of patients with increasing renal dysfunction, most commonly with severe dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 30\u00a0mL/min and/or on dialysis), and with inadequate/no calcium supplementation.  Monitor calcium levels and calcium and vitamin D intake [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.4 \t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \tOsteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported\u00a0in patients receiving Xgeva, manifesting as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration, or gingival erosion.  Persistent pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery may also be manifestations of ONJ.  In clinical trials in patients with cancer, the incidence of ONJ was higher with longer duration of exposure [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Seventy-nine percent of patients with ONJ had a history of tooth extraction, poor oral hygiene, or use of a dental appliance as a predisposing factor.  Other risk factors for the development of ONJ include immunosuppressive therapy, treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors, systemic corticosteroids, diabetes, and gingival infections.  Similarly, for Xgeva patients with multiple myeloma that developed ONJ, 58% had a history of invasive dental procedures as a predisposing factor. Perform an oral examination and appropriate preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of Xgeva and periodically during Xgeva therapy. Advise patients regarding oral hygiene practices. Avoid invasive dental procedures during treatment with Xgeva.  Consider temporary discontinuation of Xgeva therapy if an invasive dental procedure must be performed.  There are no data available to suggest the optimal duration of treatment interruption. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Xgeva should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon.  In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition.\u00a0Clinical judgment of the treating healthcare provider should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual risk/benefit assessment. 5.5 \t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \tAtypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fracture Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with Xgeva [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] .  These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area.  They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.  A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) at the time of fracture. During Xgeva treatment, patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain.  Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture.  Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb.  Interruption of Xgeva therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis. 5.6 \t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \tHypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing\u00a0Skeletons Clinically significant hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization and complicated by acute renal injury has been reported in Xgeva-treated patients with giant cell tumor of bone and patients with growing skeletons.  Hypercalcemia has been reported within the first year after treatment discontinuation.  After treatment is discontinued, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia, assess serum calcium periodically, reevaluate the patient\u2019s calcium and vitamin D supplementation requirements and  manage patients as clinically appropriate [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.7 \t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \tMultiple Vertebral Fractures (MVF) Following Treatment Discontinuation Multiple vertebral fractures (MVF) have been reported following discontinuation of treatment with denosumab.  Patients at higher risk for MVF include those with risk factors for or a history of osteoporosis or prior fractures. When Xgeva treatment is discontinued, evaluate the individual patient\u2019s risk for vertebral fractures [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. 5.8 \t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action, Xgeva\u00a0can\u00a0cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of denosumab to cynomolgus monkeys throughout pregnancy at a dose 25-fold higher than the recommended human dose of Xgeva based on body weight resulted in increased fetal loss, stillbirths, and postnatal mortality, along with evidence of absent peripheral lymph nodes, abnormal bone growth and decreased neonatal growth. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Xgeva.  Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Xgeva during pregnancy or within 5 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm.  Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy, and for at least 5\u00a0months after the last dose of Xgeva [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 ) ] .",

Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors The safety of Xgeva was evaluated in three randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trials [see Clinical Trials ( 14.1 )] in which a total of 2841\u00a0patients with bone metastasis\u00a0from prostate cancer, breast cancer, or other solid tumors, or lytic bony lesions from multiple myeloma received at least one dose of Xgeva. In Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, patients were randomized to receive either 120\u00a0mg of Xgeva every 4\u00a0weeks as a subcutaneous injection or 4\u00a0mg (dose\u00a0adjusted for reduced renal function) of zoledronic acid every 4\u00a0weeks by intravenous (IV) infusion.  Entry criteria included serum calcium (corrected) from 8 to 11.5\u00a0mg/dL (2 to 2.9\u00a0mmol/L) and creatinine clearance 30\u00a0mL/min or greater.  Patients who had received IV bisphosphonates were excluded, as were patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure.\u00a0 During the study, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4\u00a0weeks. \u00a0Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. The median duration of exposure to Xgeva was 12\u00a0months (range: 0.1-41) and median duration on-study was 13\u00a0months (range:\u00a00.1-41). Of patients who received Xgeva, 46% were female. Eighty-five percent were White, 5% Hispanic/Latino, 6% Asian, and 3% Black. The median age was 63\u00a0years (range: 18-93).\u00a0 Seventy-five percent of patients who received Xgeva received concomitant chemotherapy. The most common adverse reactions in patients (incidence greater than or equal to 25%) were fatigue/asthenia, hypophosphatemia, and nausea (see Table\u00a01).  The most common serious adverse reaction was dyspnea.  The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Xgeva were osteonecrosis and hypocalcemia. Table\u00a01.\u00a0Selected a Adverse Reactions of Any Severity\u00a0(Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103) Body System Xgeva n = 2841 % Zoledronic Acid n = 2836 % GASTROINTESTINAL Nausea 31 32 Diarrhea 20 19 GENERAL Fatigue/Asthenia 45 46 INVESTIGATIONS Hypocalcemia b 18 9 Hypophosphatemia b 32 20 NEUROLOGICAL Headache 13 14 RESPIRATORY Dyspnea 21 18 Cough 15 15 a Adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of patients receiving Xgeva in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, and meeting one of the following criteria: At least 1% greater incidence in Xgeva-treated patients, or Between-group difference (either direction) of less than 1% and more than 5% greater incidence in patients treated with zoledronic acid compared to placebo (US Prescribing Information for zoledronic acid) b Laboratory-derived and below the central laboratory lower limit of normal [8.3 - 8.5\u00a0mg/dL (2.075\u00a0-\u00a02.125\u00a0mmol/L) for calcium and 2.2 - 2.8\u00a0mg/dL (0.71 - 0.9\u00a0mmol/L) for phosphorus] Severe Mineral/Electrolyte Abnormalities \u25aa Severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 7\u00a0mg/dL or less than 1.75\u00a0mmol/L) occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with Xgeva and 1.3% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. Of patients who experienced severe hypocalcemia, 33% experienced 2 or more episodes of severe hypocalcemia and 16% experienced 3 or more episodes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. \u25aa Severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2\u00a0mg/dL or less than 0.6\u00a0mmol/L) occurred in 15.4% of patients treated with Xgeva and 7.4% of patients treated with zoledronic acid. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In the primary treatment phases of Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103, ONJ was confirmed in\u00a01.8% of patients in the Xgeva\u00a0group (median exposure of 12.0\u00a0months; range: 0.1-40.5) and 1.3% of patients in the zoledronic acid group.  The trials in patients with breast (Study 20050136) or prostate (Study 20050103) cancer included an Xgeva open-label extension treatment phase where patients were offered Xgeva 120\u00a0mg once every 4\u00a0weeks (median overall exposure of 14.9\u00a0months; range: 0.1-67.2).  The patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.7% in the second year, and 4.6% per year thereafter.  The median time to ONJ was 20.6\u00a0months (range: 4-53) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . In a placebo-controlled clinical trial with an extension treatment phase evaluating Xgeva for the prevention of bone metastases in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer (a patient population for which Xgeva is not indicated), with longer treatment exposure of up to 7\u00a0years, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ was 1.1% during the first year of treatment, 3.0% in the second year, and 7.1% per year thereafter. Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fracture In the clinical trial program, atypical femoral fracture has been reported\u00a0in patients treated with Xgeva\u00a0and the risk increased with longer duration of treatment. Events have occurred during treatment and after treatment was discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Multiple Myeloma The safety of Xgeva was evaluated in an international, randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled trial of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with treatment through disease progression [see Clinical Trials ( 14.2 )] .  In this trial, patients received 120\u00a0mg Xgeva every 4 weeks as a subcutaneous injection (n = 850) or 4\u00a0mg (dose adjusted for renal function) of zoledronic acid intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks by IV infusion (n = 852).  Entry criteria included serum calcium (corrected) from 8 to 11.5\u00a0mg/dL (2 to 2.9\u00a0mmol/L) and creatinine clearance 30\u00a0mL/min or greater.  Patients who had received IV bisphosphonates were excluded, as were patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure.  During the study, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4\u00a0weeks.  Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. The median duration of exposure to Xgeva was 16 months (range: 1-50) and median duration on-study was 17 months (range: 0-49).  Of patients who received Xgeva, 46% were female, 83% percent were White, 13% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 4% Hispanic/Latino.  The median age of the patients randomized to Xgeva was 63\u00a0years (range: 29-91) and all patients who received Xgeva received concomitant anti-myeloma chemotherapy. The adverse reaction profile of Xgeva in patients with multiple myeloma, Study 20090482, was similar to that observed in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103.  The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265\u00a010%) were diarrhea (34%), nausea (32%), anemia (22%), back pain (21%), thrombocytopenia (19%), peripheral edema (17%), hypocalcemia (16%), upper respiratory tract infection (15%), rash (14%), and headache (11%).  The most common serious adverse reaction (incidence \u2265\u00a05%) was pneumonia (8%).  The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of Xgeva (\u2265\u00a01.0%) was osteonecrosis of the jaw. Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia Severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 7\u00a0mg/dL or less than 1.75\u00a0mmol/L) and severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2\u00a0mg/dL or less than 0.6\u00a0mmol/L) occurred in 2% and 21% patients treated with Xgeva, respectively. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In the primary treatment phase of Study 20090482, ONJ was confirmed in 4.1% of patients in the Xgeva group (median exposure of 16 months; range: 1-50) and 2.8% of patients in the zoledronic acid group (median 15 months, range: 1-45 months).  At the completion of the double-blind treatment phase of Study 20090482, the patient-year adjusted incidence (number of events per 100 patient years) of confirmed ONJ in the Xgeva group (median exposure of 19.4 months; range 1-52) was 2.0% during the first year of treatment, 5.0% in the second year, and 4.5% per year thereafter.  The median time to ONJ was 18.7 months (range: 1-44) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Giant Cell Tumor of Bone The safety of Xgeva was evaluated in two single-arm trials (Study 20062004 and Study 20040215) [see Clinical Trials ( 14.3 )] in which a total of 548\u00a0adult or skeletally mature adolescent patients with giant cell tumor of bone received at least 1\u00a0dose of Xgeva.\u00a0Patients received 120\u00a0mg Xgeva subcutaneously every 4\u00a0weeks with additional 120\u00a0mg doses on Days\u00a08 and 15 of the first month of therapy.  Patients receiving concurrent bisphosphonate therapy were excluded from enrollment in both studies.  Patients with prior history of ONJ or osteomyelitis of the jaw, an active dental or jaw condition requiring oral surgery, non-healed dental/oral surgery, or any planned invasive dental procedure were excluded from enrollment in Study 20040215.  During the trial, serum chemistries including calcium and phosphorus were monitored every 4\u00a0weeks.  Calcium and vitamin D supplementation was recommended but not required. Of the 548\u00a0patients who received Xgeva,\u00a0467\u00a0patients were treated with Xgeva for \u2265\u00a01\u00a0year, 323\u00a0patients for \u2265\u00a02\u00a0years, and 255\u00a0patients for \u2265\u00a03\u00a0years.  The median number of doses received was 33\u00a0(range:\u00a04-138\u00a0doses) and the median number of months on-study was 60 (range: 0-140\u00a0months).\u00a0Fifty-seven percent of the enrolled patients were women and 82% were White.  The median age was 33\u00a0years (range: 13-83\u00a0years); a total of 19\u00a0patients were skeletally mature adolescents (12 to <17\u00a0years of age). The common\u00a0adverse reaction profile of Xgeva in patients with giant cell tumor of bone was\u00a0generally similar to that reported in Studies 20050136, 20050244, and 20050103.  The most common adverse reactions in patients (incidence \u2265\u00a010%) were arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremity, fatigue, headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, musculoskeletal pain, toothache, vomiting, hypophosphatemia, constipation, diarrhea, and cough.\u00a0\u00a0The most frequent serious adverse reactions were osteonecrosis of the jaw (3.6%), bone giant cell tumor (1.5%), anemia (1.1%), pneumonia (0.9%), and back pain (0.9%).  The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of Xgeva was osteonecrosis of the jaw (incidence of 3.6%).  The adverse reaction profile appeared similar in skeletally mature adolescents and adults. Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia Moderate to severe hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium less than 8\u00a0mg/dL or less than 2\u00a0mmol/L) occurred in 5% of patients treated with Xgeva. Severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus less than 2 to 1\u00a0mg/dL or less than 0.6 to 0.3\u00a0mmol/L) occurred in 20%\u00a0of patients treated with Xgeva. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) In Study 20062004 and Study 20040215, ONJ was confirmed in 6.6% of patients who received Xgeva . [see Warnings and Prec autions ( 5.4 )] . Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fracture Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with Xgeva and was observed in 0.9% of patients in the pooled safety population [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation In the pooled safety population, 0.7% of patients experienced serious adverse events of hypercalcemia > 30 days following treatment discontinuation that was recurrent in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Xgeva was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial (Study 20070315) in which 33\u00a0patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (with or without bone metastases) refractory to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy were enrolled [see Clinical Trials ( 14.4 )] . The adverse reaction profile of Xgeva in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy was similar to that reported in Studies 20050136, 20050244, 20050103, 20062004, and 20040215.  Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 20% of patients were nausea (30%), dyspnea (27%), decreased appetite (24%), headache (24%), peripheral edema (24%), vomiting (24%), anemia (21%), constipation (21%), and diarrhea (21%).\u00a0The following adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater severity related to study therapy were reported on-study: fatigue (3%) and infection (6%). Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities included hypomagnesemia\u00a0(3%), hypokalemia (3%), and hypophosphatemia (76%) of patients.  No deaths on-study were related to Xgeva therapy. 6.2 \t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post\u00a0approval use of Xgeva.  Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypocalcemia: Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia, including fatal cases [see Contraindications ( 4.1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Hypercalcemia:  Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia following treatment discontinuation can occur [see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] . Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reactions [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Musculoskeletal pain, including severe musculoskeletal pain.  Positive re-challenge has been reported. Lichenoid drug eruptions (e.g., lichen planus-like reactions). Alopecia. 6.3 \t\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \tImmunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.  The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.  Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.  For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to denosumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies to other studies or to other products may be misleading. Using an electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay, less than 1% (7/2758) of patients with osseous metastases treated with denosumab doses ranging from 30-180\u00a0mg every 4\u00a0weeks or every 12\u00a0weeks for up to 3\u00a0years tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab.  None of the 37 patients with giant cell tumor of bone in Study 20040215 tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab. Three of the 506 patients with giant cell tumor of bone in Study 20062004 tested positive for transient binding antibodies following treatment with denosumab.\u00a0\u00a0In multiple myeloma patients in Study 20090482, 1 out of 199 patients with a post-baseline result, tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab.\u00a0No patient with positive binding antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies as assessed using a chemiluminescent cell-based in vitro biological assay.  There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, toxicity profile, or clinical response to denosumab\u00a0associated with binding antibody development.",
