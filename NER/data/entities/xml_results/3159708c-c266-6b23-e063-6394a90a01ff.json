Cardiology: For the identification of left ventricular myocardium with residual glucose metabolism and reversible loss of systolic function in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, when used together with myocardial perfusion imaging. Neurology:\u00a0 For the identification of regions of abnormal glucose metabolism associated with foci of epileptic seizures ( 1 ). 1.1 Oncology For assessment of abnormal glucose metabolism to assist in the evaluation of malignancy in patients with known or suspected abnormalities found by other testing modalities, or in patients with an existing diagnosis of cancer. 1.2 Cardiology For the identification of left ventricular myocardium with residual glucose metabolism and reversible loss of systolic function in patients with\u00a0coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, when used together with myocardial perfusion imaging. 1.3 Neurology For the identification of regions of abnormal glucose metabolism associated with foci of epileptic seizures.",

Blood glucose abnormalities: may cause suboptimal imaging ( 5.2 ). 5.1 Radiation Risks Radiation-emitting products, including Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection, may increase the risk for cancer, especially in pediatric patients.\u00a0 Use the smallest dose necessary for imaging and ensure safe handling to protect the patient and health care worker [see Dosage and Administration . (2.5 )] 5.2 Blood Glucose Abnormalities In the oncology and neurology setting, suboptimal imaging may occur in patients with inadequately regulated blood glucose levels.\u00a0 In these\u00a0patients, consider medical therapy and laboratory testing to assure at least two days of normoglycemia prior to Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection administration.",
