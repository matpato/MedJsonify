    "indications_original": "1 INDICATIONS\u00a0AND USAGE Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise,\u00a0and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used alone, or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are a combination of olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. ( 1 )",
    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are contraindicated: In patients with hypersensitivity to any component of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] In patients with anuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] For coadministration with aliskiren in patients with diabetes [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ].

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypotension: Correct volume-depletion prior to administration. ( 5.2 ) Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients ( 5.3 ) Observe for signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance. ( 5.4 ) Acute angle-closure glaucoma ( 5.5 ) Sprue-like enteropathy has been reported. Consider discontinuation of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide in cases where no other etiology is found ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. Adverse reactions include fetal or neonatal jaundice and thrombocytopenia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.2 Hypotension in Volume or Salt-Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- or salt-depleted patients ( e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide.\u00a0 If hypotension does occur, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal saline. When electrolyte and fluid imbalances have been corrected, olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide usually can be continued without difficulty.\u00a0 A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment. 5.3 Impaired Renal Function Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system ( e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients.\u00a0 Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history. 5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide contains hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide also contains olmesartan, a drug that inhibits the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Drugs that inhibit the RAS can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in patients receiving thiazide therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels. 5.6 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. 5.7 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. 5.8 Sprue-Like Enteropathy Severe, chronic diarrhea with substantial weight loss has been reported in patients taking olmesartan months to years after drug initiation. Intestinal biopsies of patients often demonstrated villous atrophy. If a patient develops these symptoms during treatment with olmesartan, exclude other etiologies. Consider discontinuation of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide in cases where no other etiology is identified.",

Olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide The concomitant use of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide was evaluated for safety in 1243 hypertensive patients. Treatment with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide was well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo. Adverse reactions were generally mild, transient and not dependent on the dose of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide. The rate of withdrawals for adverse events in all trials of hypertensive patients was 2.0% (25/1243) on olmesartan medoxomil plus hydrochlorothiazide and 2.0% (7/342) on placebo. In a placebo-controlled, factorial clinical trial of olmesartan medoxomil (2.5 mg to 40 mg) and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg to 25 mg), the following adverse reactions reported in Table 1 occurred in >2% of patients, and more often on the olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide combination than on placebo.

The trialmetits primaryendpoint,delayedonset of microalbuminuria, but olmesartan had no beneficialeffect on decline in glomerularfiltrationrate(GFR).Therewas a findingofincreased CV mortality(adjudicatedsuddencardiacdeath,fatalmyocardialinfarction,fatalstroke,revascularizationdeath) in theolmesartangroupcompared to the placebogroup (15 olmesartanvs. 3 placebo,HR 4.9, 95% confidenceinterval[CI], 1.4, 17), but therisk of non-fatalmyocardialinfarctionwas lowerwitholmesartan(HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.35, 1.18). The epidemiologicstudyincludedpatients 65 years and olderwithoverallexposure of > 300,000 patient-years.In the sub-group of diabeticpatients receivinghigh-doseolmesartan (40 mg/d)for > 6 months,thereappeared to be an increasedrisk of death(HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1, 3.8)compared to similarpatients takingotherangiotensinreceptorblockers.Incontrast,high-doseolmesartanuse in non-diabeticpatients appearedto be associatedwith a decreasedrisk of death(HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86) compared to similarpatients taking other angiotensinreceptorblockers.Nodifferenceswereobservedbetweenthegroups receivinglowerdoses of olmesartancompared to otherangiotensinblockers or thosereceiving therapy for < 6 months. Overall,thesedataraise a concern of a possibleincreased CV riskassociatedwiththeuse of high-doseolmesartan in diabeticpatients.There are, however,concerns with the credibility of the finding of increased CV risk,notably the observation in thelargeepidemiologicstudyfor a survivalbenefit in non-diabetics of a magnitudesimilar to theadversefinding in diabetics. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of \u226550,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year.",
