    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Symptomatic\u00a0Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole\u00a0is\u00a0indicated\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0treatment\u00a0of T.\u00a0vaginalis infection\u00a0in\u00a0females\u00a0and\u00a0males\u00a0when\u00a0the presence\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0trichomonad\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0confirmed\u00a0by\u00a0appropriate\u00a0laboratory\u00a0procedures\u00a0(wet\u00a0smears\u00a0and/or\u00a0cultures). Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite. Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole in cases of reinfection. Amebiasis. Metronidazole\u00a0is\u00a0indicated\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0treatment\u00a0of\u00a0acute\u00a0intestinal\u00a0amebiasis\u00a0(amebic\u00a0dysentery)\u00a0and\u00a0amebic\u00a0liver\u00a0abscess.

Anaerobic Bacterial Infections. Metronidazole is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with metronidazole therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of the aerobic infection should be used in addition to metronidazole. INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS, including peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and liver abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group ( B. fragilis, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus ), Clostridium species, Eubacterium species, Peptococcus species, and Peptostreptococcus species.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) INFECTIONS, including meningitis and brain abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS, including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. ENDOCARDITIS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of metronidazole and other antibacterial drugs, metronidazole\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0only\u00a0to\u00a0treat\u00a0or\u00a0prevent\u00a0infections\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0proven\u00a0or\u00a0strongly\u00a0suspected\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0caused\u00a0by\u00a0susceptible bacteria.

    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity Metronidazole tablets, USP are contraindicated in patients with a prior history of hypersensitivity to metronidazole or other nitroimidazole derivatives. In patients with trichomoniasis, metronidazole tablets, USP are contraindicated during the first trimester of pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS ). Interaction with Alcohol Use of oral metronidazole is associated with a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, including abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing. Discontinue consumption of alcohol or products containing propylene glycol during and for at least three days after therapy with metronidazole (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). \u200bCockayne Syndrome Metronidazole tablets, USP are contraindicated in patients with Cockayne syndrome. Severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure with fatal outcomes have been reported after initiation of metronidazole in patients with Cockayne syndrome (see \u200bADVERSE REACTIONS \u200b)",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) can be serious and potentially life threatening (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) have been reported with the use of metronidazole.

For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), a reduced dose of metronidazole is recommended. For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is needed but these patients should be monitored for metronidazole associated adverse events (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Renal Impairment Patients\u00a0with\u00a0end-stage\u00a0renal\u00a0disease\u00a0may\u00a0excrete\u00a0metronidazole\u00a0and\u00a0metabolites\u00a0slowly\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0urine,\u00a0resulting\u00a0in\u00a0significant\u00a0accumulation of\u00a0metronidazole\u00a0metabolites.\u00a0Monitoring\u00a0for\u00a0metronidazole\u00a0associated\u00a0adverse\u00a0events\u00a0is\u00a0recommended\u00a0(see CLINICAL\u00a0PHARMACOLOGY ).

Use in Patients with Blood Dyscrasias Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole and should be used with caution in patients with evidence of or history of blood dyscrasia. A mild leukopenia has been observed during its administration; however, no persistent hematologic abnormalities attributable to metronidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended before and after therapy. Drug-Resistant Bacteria and Parasites Prescribing metronidazole in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial or parasitic infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria and parasites. Information for Patients Interaction with Alcohol Discontinue consumption of alcoholic beverages or products containing propylene glycol while taking metronidazole and for at least three days afterward because abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing may occur (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Treatment of Bacterial and Parasitic Infections Patients\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0counseled\u00a0that\u00a0metronidazole\u00a0should\u00a0only\u00a0be\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0treat\u00a0bacterial\u00a0and\u00a0parasitic\u00a0infections.\u00a0Metronidazole\u00a0does\u00a0not treat\u00a0viral\u00a0infections\u00a0( e.g., the\u00a0common\u00a0cold).\u00a0When\u00a0metronidazole\u00a0is\u00a0prescribed\u00a0to\u00a0treat\u00a0a\u00a0bacterial\u00a0infection,\u00a0patients\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0told\u00a0that although\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0common\u00a0to\u00a0feel\u00a0better\u00a0early\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0course\u00a0of\u00a0therapy,\u00a0the\u00a0medication\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0taken\u00a0exactly\u00a0as\u00a0directed.\u00a0Skipping\u00a0doses\u00a0or not\u00a0completing\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0course\u00a0of\u00a0therapy\u00a0may\u00a0(1)\u00a0decrease\u00a0the\u00a0effectiveness\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0immediate\u00a0treatment\u00a0and\u00a0(2)\u00a0increase\u00a0the\u00a0likelihood that\u00a0bacteria\u00a0will\u00a0develop\u00a0resistance\u00a0and\u00a0will\u00a0not\u00a0be\u00a0treatable\u00a0by\u00a0metronidazole\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0future. Drug Interactions Disulfiram Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients who are using metronidazole and disulfiram concurrently. Metronidazole should not be given to patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alcoholic Beverages Abdominal\u00a0cramps,\u00a0nausea,\u00a0vomiting,\u00a0headaches,\u00a0and\u00a0flushing\u00a0may\u00a0occur\u00a0if\u00a0alcoholic\u00a0beverages\u00a0or\u00a0products\u00a0containing\u00a0propylene\u00a0glycol are consumed during or following metronidazole therapy (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Warfarin and other Oral Anticoagulants Metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other oral coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. When metronidazole is prescribed for patients on this type of anticoagulant therapy, prothrombin time and INR should be carefully monitored. Lithium In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term metronidazole therapy has been associated with elevation of serum lithium and, in a few cases, signs of lithium toxicity. Serum lithium and serum creatinine levels should be obtained several days after beginning metronidazole to detect any increase that may precede clinical symptoms of lithium intoxication. Busulfan Metronidazole has been reported to increase plasma concentrations of busulfan, which can result in an increased risk for serious busulfan toxicity. Metronidazole should not be administered concomitantly with busulfan unless the benefit outweighs the risk. If no therapeutic alternatives to metronidazole are available, and concomitant administration with busulfan is medically needed, frequent monitoring of busulfan plasma concentration should be performed and the busulfan dose should be adjusted accordingly. Drugs that Inhibit CYP450 Enzymes The simultaneous administration of drugs that decrease microsomal liver enzyme activity, such as cimetidine, may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma clearance of metronidazole.

Pulmonary tumors have been observed in all six reported studies in the mouse, including one study in which the animals were dosed on an intermittent schedule (administration during every fourth week only). Malignant liver tumors were increased in male mice treated at approximately 1500 mg/m2 (similar to the maximum recommended daily dose, based on body surface area comparisons). Malignant lymphomas and pulmonary neoplasms were also increased with lifetime feeding of the drug to mice. Mammary and hepatic tumors were increased among female rats administered oral metronidazole compared to concurrent controls. Two lifetime tumorigenicity studies in hamsters have been performed and reported to be negative.

Metronidazole failed to produce any adverse effects on fertility or testicular function in male rats at doses up at 400 mg/kg/day (similar to the maximum recommended clinical dose, based on body surface area comparisons) for 28 days. However, rats treated at the same dose for 6 weeks or longer were infertile and showed severe degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium in the testes as well as marked decreases in testicular spermatid counts and epididymal sperm counts. Fertility was restored in most rats after an eight week, drug-free recovery period.

Nursing Mothers Metronidazole is present in human milk at concentrations similar to maternal serum levels, and infant serum levels can be close to or comparable to infant therapeutic levels. There are no data on the effects of metronidazole on milk production. Animal studies have shown the potential for tumorigenicity after oral metronidazole was administered chronically to rats and mice (see PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility). This drug is not intended to be administered chronically; therefore, the clinical relevance of the findings of the animal studies is unclear. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for metronidazole tablets, USP and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from metronidazole tablets, USP or from the underlying maternal condition. Alternatively, a nursing mother may choose to pump and discard human milk for the duration of metronidazole tablets, USP therapy, and for 48 hours after the last dose and feed her infant stored human milk or formula.

    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS The following reactions have been reported during treatment with metronidazole: Central Nervous System The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with metronidazole have been convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity. Since persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported in some patients receiving prolonged administration of metronidazole, patients should be specifically warned about these reactions and should be told to stop the drug and report immediately to their physicians if any neurologic symptoms occur. In addition, patients have reported headache, syncope, dizziness, vertigo, incoordination, ataxia, confusion, dysarthria, irritability, de-pression, weakness, and insomnia (see WARNINGS ). Gastrointestinal The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract, particularly nausea, sometimes accompanied by headache, anorexia, and occasionally vomiting; diarrhea; epigastric distress; and abdominal cramping and constipation. Mouth A sharp, unpleasant metallic taste is not unusual. Furry tongue, glossitis, and stomatitis have occurred; these may be associated with a sudden overgrowth of Candida which may occur during therapy. Dermatologic Dermatitis bullous, fixed drug eruption, erythematous rash and pruritus. Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia); rarely, reversible thrombocytopenia. Cardiovascular Flattening of the T-wave may be seen in electrocardiographic tracings. Hypersensitivity Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) (see WARNINGS ), urticaria, erythematous rash, flushing, nasal congestion, dryness of the mouth (or vagina or vulva), and fever. Renal Dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, incontinence, and a sense of pelvic pressure. Instances of darkened urine have been reported by approximately one patient in 100,000. Although the pigment which is probably responsible for this phenomenon has not been positively identified, it is almost certainly a metabolite of metronidazole and seems to have no clinical significance. Other Proliferation of Candida in the vagina, dyspareunia, decrease of libido, proctitis, and fleeting joint pains sometimes resembling \u201cserum sickness.\u201d Rare cases of pancreatitis, which generally abated on withdrawal of the drug, have been reported. Patients with Crohn\u2019s disease are known to have an increased incidence of gastrointestinal and certain extraintestinal cancers. There have been some reports in the medical literature of breast and colon cancer in Crohn\u2019s disease patients who have been treated with metronidazole at high doses for extended periods of time. A cause and effect relationship has not been established. Crohn\u2019s disease is not an approved indication for metronidazole tablets, USP.",
