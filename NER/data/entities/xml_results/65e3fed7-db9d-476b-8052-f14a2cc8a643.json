    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: Advise patients that FINTEPLA can cause decreased appetite and decreased weight. ( 5.3 ) Somnolence, Sedation, and Lethargy: Monitor for somnolence and sedation. Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA. ( 5.4 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for suicidal behavior and thoughts. ( 5.5 ) Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: FINTEPLA should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. ( 5.6 ) Serotonin Syndrome: Advise patients that serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition and may occur with FINTEPLA, particularly with concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs. ( 5.7 ) Increase in Blood Pressure: Monitor blood pressure during treatment. ( 5.8 ) Glaucoma: Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decrease in visual acuity or ocular pain. ( 5.9 ) 5.1\tValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension FINTEPLA can cause valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There is a known association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity, including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA), and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Although no patients receiving FINTEPLA developed valvular heart disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension in clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration, cases of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension have been reported during use of FINTEPLA in the postmarketing setting [see . Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Because of this risk, cardiac monitoring is required prior to starting treatment, during treatment, and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes . Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can identify evidence of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension prior to a patient becoming symptomatic, aiding in early detection of these conditions. Monitoring Prior to starting treatment, patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months, and once 3-6 months post-treatment with FINTEPLA. The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via ECHO: Valvular abnormality or new abnormality via echocardiogram. VHD as indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation, with additional characteristics of VHD (e.g., valve thickening or restrictive valve motion). PAH as indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP > 35 mm Hg). FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 5.2\tFINTEPLA REMS Program FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program because of the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Notable requirements of the FINTEPLA REMS Program include: Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS program. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension, the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment, and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the REMS program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649. 5.3\tDecreased Appetite and Decreased Weight FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. In placebo-controlled studies for DS (Study 1 and Study 2 combined), approximately 37% of patients treated with FINTEPLA reported, as an adverse reaction, decreased appetite and approximately 9% reported decreased weight, as compared to 8% and 1%, respectively, of patients on placebo . In the placebo- controlled study for LGS (Study 3), approximately 28% of patients treated with FINTEPLA reported, as an adverse reaction, decreased appetite and approximately 5% reported decreased weight, as compared to 15% and 2%, respectively, of patients on placebo [see . By the end of the controlled studies, 19% (Studies 1 and 2 combined) of DS patients and 7% (Study 3) of LGS patients treated with FINTEPLA had a measured decrease in weight of 7% or greater from their baseline weight, compared to 2% (Study 1 and 2) and 0% (Study 3) of patients on placebo. This measured decrease in weight appeared to be dose-related. In the controlled studies for DS, 26% of patients on FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day (Study 1), 19% of patients on FINTEPLA 0.4 mg/kg/day in combination with stiripentol (Study 2), and 13% of patients taking FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day (Study 1) experienced at least a 7% decrease in weight from baseline. In the controlled study for LGS, 9% of patients on FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day\n \n(Study 3) and 6% of patients on FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day (Study 3) experienced at least a 7% decrease in weight from baseline. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Given the frequency of these adverse reactions, the growth of pediatric patients treated with FINTEPLA should be carefully monitored. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA, and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.4\tSomnolence, Sedation, and Lethargy FINTEPLA can cause somnolence, sedation, and lethargy. In controlled studies for DS (Study 1 and Study 2 combined), the incidence of somnolence, sedation, and lethargy was 25% in patients treated with FINTEPLA, compared with 11% of patients on placebo. In the controlled study for LGS (Study 3), the incidence of somnolence, sedation, and lethargy was 19% in patients treated with FINTEPLA, compared with 16% of patients on placebo. In general, these effects may diminish with continued treatment [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery. 5.5\tSuicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including FINTEPLA, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs that did not include FINTEPLA showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of\nsuicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among\n16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as 1 week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.\nBecause most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk\n \ndid not vary substantially by age (5-100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 3:\tRisk of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials in patients with epilepsy than in clinical trials in patients with psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. 5.6\tWithdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs As with most AEDs, FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered. 5.7\tSerotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, may occur with FINTEPLA, particularly with concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs, including, but not limited to, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), bupropion, triptans, dietary supplements (e.g., St. John's Wort, tryptophan), drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs], which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA [see dextromethorphan, lithium, tramadol, and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, which include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular signs (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected, treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started. Contraindications (4) ], 5.8\tIncrease in Blood Pressure FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure [see Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine, including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials of up to 3 years in duration, no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed a hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.9\tGlaucoma Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.",

In controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with Dravet syndrome (DS), 341 patients were treated with FINTEPLA, including 312 patients treated for more than 6 months, 284 patients treated for more than 1 year, and 138 patients treated for more than 2 years. In controlled and uncontrolled trials in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), 262 patients were treated with FINTEPLA, including 219 patients treated for more than 6 months, 172 patients treated for more than 1 year, and 127 patients treated for more than 2 years. Dravet Syndrome In placebo-controlled trials of patients with DS taking concomitant standard of care AEDs,\n122 patients were treated with FINTEPLA and 84 patients received placebo [see . The duration of treatment in these trials was 16 weeks (Study 1) or 17 weeks (Study 2). Clinical Studies (14.1) ] In Study 1 and Study 2, the mean age was 9 years (range 2 to 19 years) and approximately 46% of patients were female and 74% were White. All patients were receiving at least one other AED. In Study 1 and Study 2, the rates of discontinuation as a result of any adverse reaction were 13%, 0%, and 7% for patients treated with FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day, 0.2 mg/kg/day, and\n0.4 mg/kg/day in combination with stiripentol, respectively, compared to 6% for patients on placebo. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in the patients treated with any dose of FINTEPLA was somnolence (3%). The most common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with FINTEPLA (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence, sedation, lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue, malaise, asthenia; ataxia, balance disorder, gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling, salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus. Table 4 lists the adverse reactions that were reported in 5% or more of patients treated with FINTEPLA and at a rate greater than those on placebo during the titration and maintenance phases of Study 1 and Study 2. Table 4:\tAdverse Reactions in 5% or More of Patients Treated with FINTEPLA and Greater Than Placebo in Placebo-Controlled Trials for Dravet Syndrome (Study 1 and 2) Adverse Reaction FINTEPLA Dose Group Combined Placebo Group Patients in placebo groups from Studies 1 and 2 were pooled. Study 1 Study 2 0.2 mg/kg/day 0.7 mg/kg/day 0.4 mg/kg/day 0.4 mg/kg/day was not an intermediate dose. Patients on the 0.4 mg/kg/day dose were also taking concomitant stiripentol plus clobazam, which increases exposure of FINTEPLA.

The duration of treatment in this trial was 16 weeks. The mean age was\n13.7 years (range 2 to 35 years) and 29% of patients were at least 18 years of age, 45% of patients were female, and 79% were White. All patients were receiving at least one other AED. Clinical Studies (14.2) ] The rates of discontinuation as a result of any adverse reaction were 6% and 5% for patients treated with FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day and 0.2 mg/kg/day, respectively, compared to 1% for patients on placebo. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the patients treated with any dose of FINTEPLA were seizure (2%) and somnolence (2%). The common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with FINTEPLA (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions that were reported in 5% or more of patients treated with FINTEPLA and at a rate greater than those on placebo during the titration and maintenance phases of Study 3. Table 5:\tAdverse Reactions in 5% or More of Patients Treated with FINTEPLA and Greater Than Placebo in the Placebo-Controlled Trial for Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (Study 3) Adverse Reaction FINTEPLA Dose Group Study 3 Placebo Group 0.2 mg/kg/day 0.7mg/kg/day N=89 % N=87 % N=87 % Decreased appetite 20 36 12 Fatigue, malaise, asthenia 14 24 16 Somnolence, sedation, lethargy 12 22 16 Diarrhea 11 13 5 Constipation 6 9 6 Vomiting 14 8 6 Weight decreased 2 8 2 Upper respiratory tract infection 8 7 3 Seizure 9 5 7 Irritability 8 3 6 Echocardiographic Safety Assessments of Valvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension were evaluated in the placebo- controlled and open-label extension studies via echocardiography for up to 3 years in duration for 341 DS patients and 263 LGS patients [see Screening for valvular heart disease assessed for mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation, and assessed for additional characteristics of VHD (e.g., valve thickening or restrictive valve motion). Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. In these clinical studies, two patients with LGS exhibited mild aortic regurgitation (AR) but neither patient had any cardiac signs or symptoms or evidence of valvular structural changes. Neither patient had VHD. The rates of mild AR are consistent with those seen in the screening period prior to treatment (3 patients in LGS and 1 patient in DS clinical trials). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of FINTEPLA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
