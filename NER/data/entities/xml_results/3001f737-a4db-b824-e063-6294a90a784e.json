Retinoids may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )] Individuals who have known hypersensitivity to any of its components [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.2 )] Pregnancy ( 4 , 8.1 ) Hypersensitivity ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Embryofetal Toxicity: Tazarotene cream contains tazarotene, which is a teratogenic substance. Tazarotene cream is contraindicated in pregnancy. Females of child-bearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to initiating treatment and use an effective method of contraception during treatment. ( 5.1 ) Local Irritation: Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, discontinue until the integrity of the skin has been restored, or reduce dosing interval, or in the case of psoriasis, may switch to the lower concentration. Tazarotene cream should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. ( 5.2 ) Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn: Avoid exposure to sunlight, sunlamps, and weather extremes. Wear sunscreen daily. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Embryofetal Toxicity Systemic exposure to tazarotenic acid is dependent upon the extent of the body surface area treated. In patients treated topically over sufficient body surface area, exposure could be in the same order of magnitude as in orally treated animals. Although there may be less systemic exposure in the treatment of acne of the face alone due to less surface area for application, tazarotene is a teratogenic substance, and it is not known what level of exposure is required for teratogenicity in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.3 )] There were thirteen reported pregnancies in subjects who participated in the clinical trials for topical tazarotene. Nine of the subjects were found to have been treated with topical tazarotene, and the other four had been treated with vehicle. One of the subjects who was treated with tazarotene cream elected to terminate the pregnancy for non-medical reasons unrelated to treatment. The other eight pregnant women who were inadvertently exposed to topical tazarotene during clinical trials subsequently delivered apparently healthy babies. As the exact timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation times are not certain, the significance of these findings is unknown. Females of Child-bearing Potential Females of child-bearing potential should be warned of the potential risk and use adequate birth-control measures when tazarotene cream is used. The possibility that a female of child-bearing potential is pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered. A negative result for pregnancy test should be obtained within 2 weeks prior to tazarotene cream therapy. Tazarotene cream therapy should begin during a menstrual period [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 )] 5.2 Local Irritation and Hypersensitivity Reactions Local tolerability reactions (including blistering and skin desquamation) and hypersensitivity adverse reactions (including urticaria) have been observed with topical tazarotene. Application of tazarotene cream may cause excessive irritation in the skin of certain sensitive individuals. Some individuals may experience excessive pruritus, burning, skin redness or peeling. If these effects occur, the medication should either be discontinued until the integrity of the skin is restored, or the dosing should be reduced to an interval the patient can tolerate. However, efficacy at reduced frequency of application has not been established. Alternatively, patients with psoriasis who are being treated with the 0.1% concentration can be switched to the lower concentration. Frequency of application should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance. Therapy can be resumed, or the drug concentration or frequency of application can be increased as the patient becomes able to tolerate treatment. Concomitant topical medications and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect should be avoided. It is also advisable to \"rest\" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of tazarotene cream is begun. Tazarotene cream, should not be used on eczematous skin, as it may cause severe irritation. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be more irritating to patients using tazarotene cream. 5.3 Photosensitivity and Risk for Sunburn Because of heightened burning susceptibility, exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps) should be avoided unless deemed medically necessary, and in such cases, exposure should be minimized during the use of tazarotene cream. Patients must be warned to use sunscreens and protective clothing when using tazarotene cream. Patients with sunburn should be advised not to use tazarotene cream until fully recovered. Patients who may have considerable sun exposure due to their occupation and those patients with inherent sensitivity to sunlight should exercise particular caution when using tazarotene cream. Tazarotene cream should be administered with caution if the patient is also taking drugs known to be photosensitizers (e.g., thiazides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, sulfonamides) because of the increased possibility of augmented photosensitivity.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Embryofetal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Photosensitivity and Risk of Sunburn [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Plaque psoriasis: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 23% of patients are pruritus, erythema, and burning. ( 6.1 ) Acne Vulgaris: Most common adverse reactions occurring in 10 to 30% of patients are desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-922-1038 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In human dermal safety trials, tazarotene cream, 0.05% and\u00a00.1% did not induce allergic contact sensitization, phototoxicity, or photoallergy. Psoriasis The most frequent adverse reactions reported with tazarotene cream, 0.05% and 0.1% occurring in 10 to 23% of subjects, in descending order, included pruritus, erythema, and burning. Reactions occurring in greater than 1 to less than 10% of subjects, in descending order, included irritation, desquamation, stinging, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, eczema, worsening of psoriasis, skin pain, rash, hypertriglyceridemia, dry skin, skin inflammation, and peripheral edema. Tazarotene cream, 0.1%\u00a0was associated with a greater degree of local irritation than the 0.05% cream. The rates of irritation adverse reactions reported during psoriasis trials with tazarotene cream, 0.1% were 0.1-0.4% higher than those reported for tazarotene cream, 0.05%. Acne The most frequent adverse reactions reported during clinical trials with tazarotene cream 0.1% in the treatment of acne, occurring in 10-30% of subjects, in descending order included desquamation, dry skin, erythema, and burning sensation. Reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of subjects included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of tazarotene. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : blister, dermatitis, urticaria, skin exfoliation, skin discoloration (including skin hyperpigmentation or skin hypopigmentation), swelling at or near application sites, and pain.",
