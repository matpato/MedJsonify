    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Use caution when administering SOLIRIS to patients with any other systemic infection. ( 5.3 ) Infusion-Related Reactions: Monitor patients during infusion, interrupt for reactions, and institute appropriate supportive measures. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Serious Meningococcal Infections SOLIRIS, a complement inhibitor, increases a patient's susceptibility to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by meningococcal bacteria ( septicemia and/or meningitis ) in any serogroup, including non-groupable strains. Life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors. The initiation of SOLIRIS treatment is contraindicated in patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection. Complete or update meningococcal vaccination ( for serogroups A, C, W, Y and B ) at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of SOLIRIS, according to current ACIP recommendations for patients receiving a complement inhibitor. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations, considering the duration of therapy with SOLIRIS. Note that ACIP recommends an administration schedule in patients receiving complement inhibitors that differs from the administration schedule in the vaccine prescribing information. If urgent SOLIRIS therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to ACIP recommendations, provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis and administer meningococcal vaccines as soon as possible. Various durations and regimens of antibacterial drug prophylaxis have been considered, but the optimal durations and drug regimens for prophylaxis and their efficacy have not been studied in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients receiving complement inhibitors, including SOLIRIS. The benefits and risks of treatment with SOLIRIS, as well as the benefits and risks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis in unvaccinated or vaccinated patients, must be considered against the known risks for serious infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis . Vaccination does not eliminate the risk of serious meningococcal infections, despite development of antibodies following vaccination. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and instruct patients to seek immediate medical care if these signs and symptoms occur. Promptly treat known infections. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider interruption of SOLIRIS in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection depending on the risks of interrupting treatment in the disease being treated. SOLIRIS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] 5.2 ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS REMS SOLIRIS is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS REMS, because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] . Notable requirements of the ULTOMIRIS and SOLIRIS REMS include the following: Prescribers must enroll in the REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious meningococcal infection. Prescribers must provide the patients with the REMS educational materials. Prescribers must assess patient vaccination status for meningococcal vaccines ( against serogroups A, C, W, Y and B ) and vaccinate if needed according to current ACIP recommendations two weeks prior to the first dose of SOLIRIS. Prescribers must provide a prescription for antibacterial drug prophylaxis if treatment must be started urgently and the patient is not up to date with meningococcal vaccines according to current ACIP recommendations at least two weeks prior to the first dose of SOLIRIS. Healthcare settings and pharmacies that dispense SOLIRIS must be certified in the REMS and must verify prescribers are certified. Patients must receive counseling from the prescriber about the need to receive meningococcal vaccines per ACIP recommendations, the need to take antibiotics as directed by the prescriber, and the signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection. Patients must be instructed to carry the Patient Safety Card with them at all times during and for 3 months following treatment with SOLIRIS. Further information is available at www.UltSolREMS.com or 1-888-765-4747. 5.3 Other Infections Serious infections with Neisseria species ( other than Neisseria meningitidis ) , including disseminated gonococcal infections, have been reported. SOLIRIS blocks terminal complement activation; therefore patients may have increased susceptibility to infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria such as infections with Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and to a lesser extent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Additionally, Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Children treated with SOLIRIS may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) . Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) infections according to ACIP recommendations. Patients receiving SOLIRIS are at increased risk for infections due to these organisms, even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. 5.4 Monitoring Disease Manifestations after SOLIRIS Discontinuation Treatment Discontinuation for PNH Monitor patients after discontinuing SOLIRIS for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis. Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS After discontinuing SOLIRIS, monitor patients with aHUS for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) complications for at least 12 weeks. In aHUS clinical trials, 18 patients ( 5 in the prospective studies ) discontinued SOLIRIS treatment. TMA complications occurred following a missed dose in 5 patients, and SOLIRIS was reinitiated in 4 of these 5 patients. Clinical signs and symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status, seizures, angina, dyspnea, or thrombosis. In addition, the following changes in laboratory parameters may identify a TMA complication: occurrence of two, or repeated measurement of any one of the following: a decrease in platelet count by 25% or more compared to baseline or the peak platelet count during SOLIRIS treatment; an increase in serum creatinine by 25% or more compared to baseline or nadir during SOLIRIS treatment; or, an increase in serum LDH by 25% or more over baseline or nadir during SOLIRIS treatment. If TMA complications occur after SOLIRIS discontinuation, consider reinstitution of SOLIRIS treatment, plasma therapy [plasmapheresis, plasma exchange, or fresh frozen plasma infusion ( PE/PI ) ] , or appropriate organ-specific supportive measures. 5.5 Thrombosis Prevention and Management The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during SOLIRIS treatment has not been established. Therefore, treatment with SOLIRIS should not alter anticoagulant management. 5.6 Infusion-Related Reactions Administration of SOLIRIS may result in infusion-related reactions, including anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions. In clinical trials, no patients experienced an infusion-related reaction which required discontinuation of SOLIRIS. Interrupt SOLIRIS infusion and institute appropriate supportive measures if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Serious Meningococcal Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Other Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Monitoring Disease Manifestations after SOLIRIS Discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Thrombosis Prevention and Management [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Infusion-Related Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the PNH randomized trial ( \u226510% overall and greater than placebo ) are: headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reactions in aHUS single arm prospective trials ( \u226520% ) are: headache, diarrhea, hypertension, upper respiratory infection, abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, anemia, cough, peripheral edema, nausea, urinary tract infections, pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reaction in the gMG placebo-controlled clinical trial ( \u226510% ) in adult patients is musculoskeletal pain. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the NMOSD placebo- controlled trial ( \u226510% ) are: upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, back pain, dizziness, influenza, arthralgia, pharyngitis, and contusion.

Meningococcal infections are the most important adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving SOLIRIS. In PNH clinical studies, two patients experienced meningococcal sepsis. Both patients had previously received a meningococcal vaccine. In clinical studies among patients without PNH, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient. Meningococcal sepsis occurred in one previously vaccinated patient enrolled in the retrospective aHUS study during the post-study follow-up period [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] PNH The data described below reflect exposure to SOLIRIS in 196 adult patients with PNH, age 18-85, of whom 55% were female. All had signs or symptoms of intravascular hemolysis. SOLIRIS was studied in a placebo-controlled clinical study ( PNH Study 1, in which 43 patients received SOLIRIS and 44, placebo ) ; a single arm clinical study ( PNH Study 2 ) ; and a long term extension study ( E05-001 ) . 182 patients were exposed for greater than one year. All patients received the recommended SOLIRIS dose regimen. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a numerically higher rate in the SOLIRIS group than the placebo group and at a rate of 5% or more among patients treated with SOLIRIS.

The serious reactions included infections and progression of PNH. No deaths occurred in the study and no patients receiving SOLIRIS experienced a thrombotic event; one thrombotic event occurred in a patient receiving placebo. Among 193 patients with PNH treated with SOLIRIS in the single arm, clinical study or the follow-up study, the adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical study. Serious adverse reactions occurred among 16% of the patients in these studies. The most common serious adverse reactions were: viral infection ( 2% ) , headache ( 2% ) , anemia ( 2% ) , and pyrexia ( 2% ) . aHUS The safety of SOLIRIS therapy in patients with aHUS was evaluated in four prospective, single-arm studies, three in adult and adolescent patients ( Studies C08-002 A/B, C08-003 A/B, and C10-004 ) , one in pediatric and adolescent patients ( Study C10-003 ) , and one retrospective study ( Study C09-001 r ) . The data described below were derived from 78 adult and adolescent patients with aHUS in Studies C08-002 A/B, C08-003 A/B and C10-004. All patients received the recommended dosage of SOLIRIS. Median exposure was 67 weeks ( range: 2-145 weeks ) . Table 6 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients in Studies C08-002 A/B, C08-003 A/B and C10-004 combined.

The most commonly reported SAEs were infections ( 24% ) , hypertension ( 5% ) , chronic renal failure ( 5% ) , and renal impairment ( 5% ) . Five patients discontinued SOLIRIS due to adverse events; three due to worsening renal function, one due to new diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and one due to meningococcal meningitis. Study C10-003 included 22 pediatric and adolescent patients, of which 18 patients were less than 12 years of age. All patients received the recommended dosage of SOLIRIS. Median exposure was 44 weeks ( range: 1 dose-87 weeks ) . Table 7 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients enrolled in Study C10-003.

One patient discontinued SOLIRIS due to an adverse event ( severe agitation ) . Analysis of retrospectively collected adverse event data from pediatric and adult patients enrolled in Study C09-001 r ( N=30 ) revealed a safety profile that was similar to that which was observed in the two prospective studies. Study C09-001 r included 19 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. Overall, the safety of SOLIRIS in pediatric patients with aHUS enrolled in Study C09-001 r appeared similar to that observed in adult patients. The most common ( \u226515% ) adverse events occurring in pediatric patients are presented in Table 8.
