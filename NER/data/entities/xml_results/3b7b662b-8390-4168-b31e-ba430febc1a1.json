During clinical trials, 2047 subjects with inflammatory lesions of rosacea received ivermectin cream once daily. A total of 1555 subjects were treated once daily for more than 12 weeks, and 519 for approximately one year. Adverse reactions, reported in \u2264 1% of subjects treated with ivermectin cream for at least 3 months in vehicle-controlled clinical trials, included skin burning sensation and skin irritation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Local adverse reactions: contact dermatitis and allergic dermatitis.",
