    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Withdrawal Patients should be instructed not to discontinue therapy without consulting their physician. Sudden cessation of clonidine treatment has, in some cases, resulted in symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, headache, and tremor accompanied or followed by a rapid\u00a0rise\u00a0in\u00a0blood\u00a0pressure\u00a0and\u00a0elevated\u00a0catecholamine concentrations in the plasma. The likelihood of such reactions to discontinuation of clonidine therapy appears to be greater after administration of higher doses or continuation of concomitant beta-blocker treatment and special caution is therefore advised in these situations. Rare instances of hypertensive\u00a0encephalopathy, cerebrovascular\u00a0accidents and death have been reported after clonidine withdrawal. When discontinuing therapy with clonidine, the physician should reduce the dose gradually over 2 to 4 days to avoid withdrawal\u00a0symptomatology. An excessive rise in blood pressure following discontinuation of clonidine therapy can be reversed by administration of oral clonidine hydrochloride or by intravenous\u00a0phentolamine.\u00a0If\u00a0therapy\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0discontinued in patients receiving a beta-blocker and clonidine concurrently, the beta-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual discontinuation of clonidine. Because children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting, they may be particularly susceptible to hypertensive episodes resulting from abrupt inability to take medication.PRECAUTIONS General In patients who have developed localized contact sensitization to transdermal clonidine, continuation of transdermal clonidine or substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride therapy may be associated with the development of a generalized skin rash. In patients who develop an allergic reaction to transdermal clonidine, substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride may also elicit an allergic reaction (including generalized rash, urticaria, or angioedema.) The sympatholytic action of clonidine may worsen sinus\u00a0node\u00a0dysfunction\u00a0and\u00a0atrioventricular\u00a0(AV)\u00a0block, especially\u00a0in\u00a0patients\u00a0taking\u00a0other\u00a0sympatholytic\u00a0drugs. There are post-marketing reports of patients with conduction abnormalities and/or taking other sympatholytic drugs who developed severe bradycardia requiring IV atropine, IV isoproterenol and temporary cardiac pacing while taking\u00a0clonidine. In hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma, no\u00a0therapeutic effect of clonidine hydrochloride tablets can be expected. Perioperative Use Administration of clonidine hydrochloride tablets should be continued to within four hours of surgery and resumed as soon as possible thereafter. Blood pressure\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0carefully\u00a0monitored\u00a0during\u00a0surgery and additional measures to control blood pressure should be available if\u00a0required. Information for Patients Patients should be cautioned against interruption of clonidine hydrochloride tablets therapy without their physician's advice. Since patients may experience a possible sedative effect, dizziness, or accommodation disorder with use of clonidine, caution patients about engaging in activities such as driving a vehicle or operating appliances or machinery. Also, inform patients that this sedative effect may be increased by concomitant use of alcohol, barbiturates, or other sedating\u00a0drugs. Patients\u00a0who\u00a0wear\u00a0contact\u00a0lenses\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0cautioned that treatment with clonidine hydrochloride tablets may cause dryness of\u00a0eyes. Drug Interactions Clonidine may potentiate the CNS-depressive effects of alcohol, barbiturates or other sedating drugs. If a patient\u00a0receiving\u00a0clonidine\u00a0hydrochloride\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0taking tricyclic antidepressants, the hypotensive effect of clonidine may be reduced, necessitating an increase in the clonidine dose. If a patient receiving clonidine is also taking neuroleptics, orthostatic regulation disturbances (e.g.,\u00a0orthostatic\u00a0hypotension,\u00a0dizziness, fatigue) may be induced or\u00a0exacerbated. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving clonidine concomitantly with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction, e . g ., digitalis, calcium channel\u00a0blockers,\u00a0and\u00a0beta-blockers.\u00a0Sinus\u00a0bradycardia resulting\u00a0in\u00a0hospitalization\u00a0and\u00a0pacemaker\u00a0insertion\u00a0has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concomitantly with diltiazem or\u00a0verapamil. Amitriptyline in combination with clonidine enhances the manifestation of corneal lesions in rats (See Toxicology ) . Based on observations in patients in a state of alcoholic delirium it has been suggested that high intravenous doses of clonidine may increase the arrhythmogenic\u00a0potential\u00a0(QT-prolongation,\u00a0ventricular fibrillation) of high intravenous doses of haloperidol. Causal relationship and relevance for clonidine oral tablets have not been\u00a0established. Toxicology In several studies with oral clonidine hydrochloride, a dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of spontaneous retinal degeneration was seen in albino rats treated for six months or longer. Tissue distribution studies in dogs and monkeys showed a concentration of clonidine in the choroid. In view of the retinal degeneration seen in rats, eye examinations were performed during clinical trials in 908 patients before, and periodically after, the start of clonidine therapy. In 353 of these 908 patients, the eye examinations were carried out over periods of 24 months or longer. Except for some dryness of the eyes, no drug-related abnormal ophthalmological findings were recorded and, according to specialized tests such as electroretinography and macular dazzle, retinal function was\u00a0unchanged. In\u00a0combination\u00a0with\u00a0amitriptyline,\u00a0clonidine\u00a0hydrochloride administration led to the development of corneal lesions in rats within 5\u00a0days. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Chronic dietary administration of clonidine was not carcinogenic to rats (132 weeks) or mice (78 weeks) dosed,\u00a0\u00a0respectively,\u00a0\u00a0at\u00a0\u00a0up  to\u00a0\u00a046\u00a0\u00a0or\u00a0\u00a070\u00a0\u00a0times\u00a0\u00a0the maximum recommended daily human dose as mg/kg (9 or 6 times the MRDHD on a mg/m 2 basis). There was no evidence of genotoxicity in the Ames test for mutagenicity or mouse micronucleus test for clastogenicity. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by clonidine\u00a0doses\u00a0as\u00a0high\u00a0as\u00a0150\u00a0mcg/kg\u00a0(approximately 3 times MRDHD). In a separate experiment, fertility of female rats appeared to be affected at dose levels of 500 to 2000 mcg/kg (10 to 40 times the oral MRDHD on a mg/kg basis; 2 to 8 times the MRDHD on a mg/m' basis.) Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies performed in rabbits at doses up to approximately 3 times the oral maximum recommended daily human dose (MRDHD) of clonidine hydrochloride tablets produced no evidence of a teratogenic or embryotoxic potential in rabbits. In rats, however, doses as low as 1/3 the oral MRDHD (1/15 the MRDHD on a mg/m 2 basis) of clonidine were associated with increased resorptions in a study in which dams were treated continuously from 2 months prior to mating. Increased resorptions were not associated with treatment at the same time or at higher dose levels (up to 3 times the oral MRDHD) when the dams were treated on gestation days 6\u00a0to\u00a015. Increases in resorption were observed at much higher dose levels (40 times the oral MRDHD on a mg/kg\u00a0basis;\u00a04\u00a0to\u00a08\u00a0times\u00a0the\u00a0MRDHD\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0mg/m 2 basis) in mice and rats treated on gestation days 1\u00a0to\u00a014 (lowest dose employed in the study was 500 mcg/kg). No adequate,\u00a0well-controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women. Clonidine crosses the placental\u00a0barrier\u00a0(see CLINICAL\u00a0PHARMACOLOGY, , Pharmacokinetics ). Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly\u00a0needed. Nursing Mothers As clonidine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk, caution\u00a0should\u00a0be\u00a0exercised\u00a0when\u00a0clonidine\u00a0hydrochloride tablets are administered to a nursing\u00a0woman. Pediatric Use Safety\u00a0and\u00a0effectiveness\u00a0in\u00a0pediatric\u00a0patients\u00a0have\u00a0not been established in adequate and well-controlled trials (See WARNINGS , Withdrawal ).",
