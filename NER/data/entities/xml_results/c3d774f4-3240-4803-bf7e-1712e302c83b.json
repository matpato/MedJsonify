    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: Use has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. Has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease and is not recommended in these patients. ( 5.2 ) Acute Kidney Injury: Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions that could lead to volume depletion. ( 5.3 ) Acute Gallbladder Disease: Has been reported in clinical trials. If cholecystitis is suspected, gallbladder studies and clinical follow-up are indicated. ( 5.4 ) Acute Pancreatitis: Has been reported in clinical trials. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected. ( 5.5 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported postmarketing with tirzepatide. If suspected, advise patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue ZEPBOUND. ( 5.6 ) Hypoglycemia: Concomitant use with insulin or an insulin secretagogue may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia. Reducing dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be necessary. Inform all patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. ( 5.7 ) Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Has not been studied in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema. Monitor patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy for progression. ( 5.8 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor for depression or suicidal thoughts. Discontinue ZEPBOUND if symptoms develop. ( 5.9 ) Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation: Has been reported in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers of any planned surgeries or procedures. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors In rats, tirzepatide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in a 2-year study at clinically relevant plasma exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( . It is unknown whether ZEPBOUND causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including MTC, in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined. 13.1 )] ZEPBOUND is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN\u00a02. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of ZEPBOUND and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with ZEPBOUND. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values >50\u00a0ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated. 5.2 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Use of ZEPBOUND has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe [see Adverse Reactions ( . In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving ZEPBOUND (5\u00a0mg 1.7%, 10\u00a0mg 2.5%, 15\u00a0mg 3.1%) than placebo (1%). Similar rates of severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were observed in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction and in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for OSA. 6.1 )] ZEPBOUND has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients. 5.3 Acute Kidney Injury Use of ZEPBOUND has been associated with acute kidney injury, which can result from dehydration due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions to ZEPBOUND, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Monitor renal function in patients reporting adverse reactions to ZEPBOUND that could lead to volume depletion. 5.4 Acute Gallbladder Disease Treatment with ZEPBOUND and GLP-1 receptor agonists is associated with an increased occurrence of acute gallbladder disease. In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), cholelithiasis was reported in 1.1% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients, cholecystitis was reported in 0.7% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, and cholecystectomy was reported in 0.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and no placebo-treated patients. Acute gallbladder events were associated with weight reduction. Similar rates of cholelithiasis were reported in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction and in ZEPBOUND trials for OSA. If cholecystitis is suspected, gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated. 5.5 Acute Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists or tirzepatide. In clinical trials of tirzepatide for a different indication, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 tirzepatide-treated patients (0.23 patients per 100\u00a0years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 comparator-treated patients (0.11 patients per 100\u00a0years of exposure). In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), 0.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients had acute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication (0.14 patients per 100\u00a0years of exposure) versus 0.2% of placebo-treated patients (0.15 patients per 100\u00a0years of exposure). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate for treatment-emergent adjudication-confirmed pancreatitis in the pooled clinical studies for OSA (Studies 5 and 6) was 0.84 patients per 100\u00a0years for ZEPBOUND and 0 for placebo-treated patients. After initiation of ZEPBOUND, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue ZEPBOUND and initiate appropriate management. Continuation of ZEPBOUND after a confirmed diagnosis of pancreatitis should be individually determined in the clinical judgment of a patient's health care provider. 5.6 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) in patients treated with tirzepatide. In a pool of two ZEPBOUND clinical studies for weight reduction (Studies 1 and 2), 0.1% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients had severe hypersensitivity reactions compared to no placebo-treated patients. Similar rates of severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed in ZEPBOUND clinical trials for weight reduction and in ZEPBOUND trials for OSA. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, advise patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue use of ZEPBOUND. Do not use in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in ZEPBOUND [see Contraindications ( . 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with ZEPBOUND. 5.7 Hypoglycemia ZEPBOUND lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia. In a trial of patients with type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus and BMI \u226527\u00a0kg/m 2 (Study 2), hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <54\u00a0mg/dL) was reported in 4.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients versus 1.3% of placebo-treated patients. In this trial, patients taking ZEPBOUND in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) had increased risk of hypoglycemia (10.3%) compared to ZEPBOUND-treated patients not taking a sulfonylurea (2.1%). There is also increased risk of hypoglycemia in patients treated with tirzepatide in combination with insulin [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 )] Hypoglycemia has also been associated with ZEPBOUND and GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults without type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In patients with diabetes mellitus, monitor blood glucose prior to starting ZEPBOUND and during ZEPBOUND treatment. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of insulin or sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue). 5.8 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with Type\u00a02 Diabetes Mellitus Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Tirzepatide has not been studied in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy. 5.9 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Suicidal behavior and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other weight management products. Monitor patients treated with ZEPBOUND for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behaviors, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Discontinue ZEPBOUND in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Avoid ZEPBOUND in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation. 5.10 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation ZEPBOUND delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations. 12.2 )] Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking ZEPBOUND, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing ZEPBOUND could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking ZEPBOUND.",

Adverse Reactions in Patients for Weight Reduction and Long-Term Maintenance Pool of Placebo - Controlled Weight Reduction Trials in Adults with Obesity or Overweight, with or without Type 2 Diabetes (Study 1 and Study 2) ZEPBOUND was evaluated for safety in a pool of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that included 2,519 adult patients with obesity or overweight treated with ZEPBOUND for up to 72\u00a0weeks and a 4-week off drug follow-up period (Study 1 and Study 2) [see Clinical Studies ( . The mean age of patients was 47\u00a0years and 37% were male. The population was 72% White, 12% Asian, 8% Black or African American, and 7% American Indian or Alaska Native; 51% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Baseline characteristics included an average BMI of 37.4\u00a0kg/m 14.1 )] 2 , 29% with a BMI \u226540\u00a0kg/m 2 , 41% with hypertension, 37% with dyslipidemia, 25% with type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus, 7% with obstructive sleep apnea, and 4% with cardiovascular disease. Across both trials, 4.8%, 6.3%, and 6.7% of patients treated with 5\u00a0mg, 10\u00a0mg, and 15\u00a0mg of ZEPBOUND, respectively, permanently discontinued treatment as a result of adverse reactions compared to 3.4% of patients treated with placebo. The majority of patients who discontinued ZEPBOUND due to adverse reactions did so during the first few months of treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Common Adverse Reactions Table\u00a01 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of ZEPBOUND in the pool of two placebo-controlled trials for weight reduction (Study 1 and Study 2). These adverse reactions occurred more commonly with ZEPBOUND than with placebo and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with ZEPBOUND. Table 1: Adverse Reactions (\u22652% and Greater than Placebo) in ZEPBOUND-Treated Adults with Obesity or Overweight in Weight Reduction and Long-term Maintenance Trials (Study 1 and Study 2) a Includes diarrhea, frequent bowel movements. b Includes constipation, feces hard. c Includes abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, abdominal pain upper, abdominal tenderness. d Includes multiple related adverse event terms, such as injection site bruising, injection site erythema, injection site pruritus, injection site pain, injection site rash, injection site reaction. e Includes asthenia, fatigue, lethargy, malaise. f Includes blood pressure decreased, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension. Adverse Reaction Placebo (N=958) % ZEPBOUND 5\u00a0mg (N=630) % ZEPBOUND 10\u00a0mg (N=948) % ZEPBOUND 15\u00a0mg (N=941) % Nausea 8 25 29 28 Diarrhea a 8 19 21 23 Vomiting 2 8 11 13 Constipation b 5 17 14 11 Abdominal Pain c 5 9 9 10 Dyspepsia 4 9 9 10 Injection Site Reactions d 2 6 8 8 Fatigue e 3 5 6 7 Hypersensitivity Reactions 3 5 5 5 Eructation 1 4 5 5 Hair Loss 1 5 4 5 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease 2 4 4 5 Flatulence 2 3 3 4 Abdominal Distension 2 3 3 4 Dizziness 2 4 5 4 Hypotension f 0 1 1 2 In a clinical trial for weight reduction that included an intensive lifestyle intervention lead-in period (Study 3), 287 patients were treated with ZEPBOUND for up to 72\u00a0weeks. In a randomized withdrawal trial (Study 4), 783 patients were treated with ZEPBOUND for up to 36\u00a0weeks, and 335 of these patients were treated for up to 88\u00a0weeks [see Clinical Studies ( . In Study 3, 10% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients discontinued drug due to adverse reactions. In Study 4, 7% of patients discontinued ZEPBOUND treatment before randomized withdrawal at Week 36 due to adverse reactions. In Study 3 and Study 4, adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the two pooled ZEPBOUND clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2). 14.1 )] Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions In a pool of Study 1 and 2, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving ZEPBOUND (5\u00a0mg 56%, 10\u00a0mg 56%, 15\u00a0mg 56%) than placebo (30%). More patients receiving ZEPBOUND 5\u00a0mg (1.9%), ZEPBOUND 10\u00a0mg (3.3%), and ZEPBOUND 15\u00a0mg (4.3%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo (0.5%). The majority of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea events occurred during dose escalation and decreased over time. Hypotension In a pool of Study 1 and 2, hypotension occurred more frequently among patients taking ZEPBOUND (1.6%) than patients taking placebo (0.1%). Hypotension was more frequently seen in ZEPBOUND-treated patients on concomitant antihypertensive therapy (2.2%) compared to ZEPBOUND-treated patients not on antihypertensive therapy (1.2%). Hypotension also occurred in association with gastrointestinal adverse events and dehydration. Hypersensitivity Reactions In a pool of Study 1 and 2, immediate hypersensitivity reactions (within one day after drug administration) occurred in 2.1% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients compared to 0.4% of placebo-treated patients, while non-immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 3.5% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients compared to 2.7% of placebo-treated patients. Among ZEPBOUND-treated patients, hypersensitivity reactions were more frequent in those with anti-tirzepatide antibodies (6.2%) compared to those who did not develop anti-tirzepatide antibodies (3%) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . The majority of the hypersensitivity reactions in trials were skin reactions (e.g., rash, itching). 12.6 )] Injection Site Reactions In ZEPBOUND-treated patients in a pool of Study 1 and 2, injection site reactions were more frequent in those with anti-tirzepatide antibodies (11.3%) compared to those who did not develop anti-tirzepatide antibodies (1%) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . 12.6 )] Hair Loss Hair loss adverse reactions in ZEPBOUND-treated patients were associated with weight reduction. In a pool of Study 1 and 2, hair loss was reported more frequently in female than male patients in the ZEPBOUND (7.1% female versus 0.5% male) and placebo (1.3% female versus 0% male) treatment groups. No ZEPBOUND-treated patients and one placebo-treated patient discontinued study treatment due to hair loss. Other Adverse Reactions Acute Kidney Injury In a pool of Study 1 and 2, acute kidney injury was reported in 0.5% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients compared to 0.2% of placebo-treated patients. Acute Gallbladder Disease In a pool of Study 1 and 2, cholelithiasis was reported in 1.1% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients, cholecystitis was reported in 0.7% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 0.2% of placebo-treated patients, and cholecystectomy was reported in 0.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and no placebo-treated patients. Hypoglycemia In Study 2, a trial of patients with type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus and BMI \u226527\u00a0kg/m 2 , hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <54\u00a0mg/dL) was reported in 4.2% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients versus 1.3% of placebo-treated patients. In Study 1, a trial of ZEPBOUND in adults with obesity/overweight without type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus, there was no systematic capturing of hypoglycemia, but plasma glucose <54\u00a0mg/dL was reported in 0.3% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients versus no placebo-treated patients. Heart Rate Increase In a pool of Study 1 and 2, treatment with ZEPBOUND resulted in a mean increase in heart rate of 1 to 3\u00a0beats per minute compared to no increase in placebo-treated patients. Dysesthesia In a pool of Study 1 and 2, dysesthesia occurred more frequently among patients receiving ZEPBOUND (5\u00a0mg 0.2%, 10\u00a0mg 0.2%, 15\u00a0mg 0.4%) than placebo (0.1%). Dysgeusia In a pool of Study 1 and 2, dysgeusia was reported by 0.4% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and no placebo-treated patients. Dry Mouth In a pool of Study 1 and 2, dry mouth or dry throat was reported by 1% of ZEPBOUND-treated patients and 0.1% of placebo-treated patients. Laboratory Abnormalities Amylase and Lipase Increase In a pool of Study 1 and 2, treatment with ZEPBOUND resulted in mean increases from baseline in serum pancreatic amylase concentrations of 20% to 25% and serum lipase concentrations of 28% to 35%, compared to mean increases from baseline in pancreatic amylase of 2.1% and serum lipase of 5.8% in placebo-treated patients. The clinical significance of elevations in amylase or lipase with ZEPBOUND is unknown in the absence of other signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea ZEPBOUND was evaluated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Study 5 and Study 6) that included a total of 467 adult patients with moderate to severe OSA and obesity [see Clinical Studies ( . Study 5 enrolled 234 patients who were unable or unwilling to use Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy and Study 6 enrolled 235 patients who were on PAP therapy. The adverse reactions observed with ZEPBOUND 10\u00a0mg or 15\u00a0mg administered subcutaneously once weekly were similar to those reported in the two pooled placebo controlled clinical trials for weight reduction (Study 1 and Study 2). 14.2 )] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in ZEPBOUND. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema Gastrointestinal: ileus Pulmonary: Pulmonary aspiration has occurred in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation.",
