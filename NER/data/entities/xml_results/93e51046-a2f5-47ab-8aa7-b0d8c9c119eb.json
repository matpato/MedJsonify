    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pigmentation: Pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and      eyelashes can occur. Iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent. (5.1) Eyelash Changes: Gradual change to eyelashes including increased length,      thickness and number of lashes. Usually reversible. (5.2) 5.1 Pigmentation Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid) and eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as bimatoprost is administered. The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes. After discontinuation of bimatoprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation. The long term effects of increased pigmentation are not known. Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly. 5.2 Eyelash Changes Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. These changes include increased length, thickness, and number of lashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. 5.3 Intraocular Inflammation Prostaglandin analogs, including bimatoprost, have been reported to cause intraocular inflammation. In addition, because these products may exacerbate inflammation, caution should be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation (e.g., uveitis). 5.4 Macular Edema Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution. Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema. 5.5 Bacterial Keratitis There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. 5.6 Contact Lens Use Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% contains benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by and cause discoloration of soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Pigmentation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Eyelash Changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Intraocular Inflammation [see Warnings and Precautions      (5.3)] Macular Edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)] Most common adverse reaction (45%) is conjunctival hyperemia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Somerset Therapeutics, LLC at 1-800-417-9175 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, the most frequent events associated with the use of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% occurring in approximately 15% to 45% of patients, in descending order of incidence, included conjunctival hyperemia, growth of eyelashes, and ocular pruritus. Approximately 3% of patients discontinued therapy due to conjunctival hyperemia. Ocular adverse events occurring in approximately 3 to 10% of patients, in descending order of incidence, included ocular dryness, visual disturbance, ocular burning, foreign body sensation, eye pain, pigmentation of the periocular skin, blepharitis, cataract, superficial punctate keratitis, periorbital erythema, ocular irritation, and eyelash darkening. The following ocular adverse events reported in approximately 1 to 3% of patients, in descending order of incidence, included: eye discharge, tearing, photophobia, allergic conjunctivitis, asthenopia, increases in iris pigmentation, and conjunctival edema. In less than 1% of patients, intraocular inflammation was reported as iritis. Systemic adverse events reported in approximately 10% of patients were infections (primarily colds and upper respiratory tract infections). The following systemic adverse events reported in approximately 1 to 5% of patients, in descending order of incidence, included headaches, abnormal liver function tests, asthenia and hirsutism. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to bimatoprost ophthalmic solution, or a combination of these factors, include: abnormal hair growth, asthma-like symptoms, dizziness, dyspnea, eyelid edema, hypersensitivity reaction including signs and symptoms of eye allergy and allergic dermatitis, hypertension, nausea, and periorbital and lid changes associated with periorbital fat atrophy leading to skin tightness, deepening of the eyelid sulcus, eyelid ptosis, enophthalmos and eyelid retraction; and skin discoloration (non-periocular).",
