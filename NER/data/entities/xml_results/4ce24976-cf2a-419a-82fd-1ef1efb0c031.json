    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity : Inform patients of warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Discontinue if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen or if clinical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop. ( 5.3 ) Hypertension: Patients taking some antihypertensive medications may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. Monitor blood pressure. ( 5.4 , 7 ) Heart Failure and Edema: Avoid use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN and NAPROXEN SODIUM in patients with severe heart failure unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening heart failure. ( 5.5 ) Renal Toxicity: Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia. Avoid use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN and NAPROXEN SODIUM in patients with advanced renal disease unless benefits are expected to outweigh risk of worsening renal function. ( 5.6 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. ( 5.7 ) Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity: NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN and NAPROXEN SODIUM are contraindicated in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. Monitor patients with preexisting asthma ( without aspirin sensitivity ) . ( 5.8 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Discontinue NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN and NAPROXEN SODIUM at first appearance of skin rash or other signs of hypersensitivity. ( 5.9 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) : Discontinue and evaluate clinically ( 5.10 ) . Fetal Toxicity: Limit use of NSAIDs, including NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM, between about 20 to 30 weeks in pregnancy due to the risk of oligohydramnios/fetal dysfunction. Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy due to the risks of oligohydramnios/fetal renal dysfunction and premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Hematologic Toxicity: Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit in patients with any signs or symptoms of anemia. ( 5.12 , 7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular ( CV ) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction ( MI ) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as naproxen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal ( GI ) events [see . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Status Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) Surgery Two large, controlled, clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10 to 14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. NSAIDs are contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see . Contraindications ( 4 ) ] Post-MI Patients Observational studies conducted in the Danish National Registry have demonstrated that patients treated with NSAIDs in the post-MI period were at increased risk of reinfarction, CV-related death, and all-cause mortality beginning in the first week of treatment. In this same cohort, the incidence of death in the first year post-MI was 20 per 100 person years in NSAID-treated patients compared to 12 per 100 person years in non-NSAID exposed patients. Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Avoid the use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM in patients with a recent MI unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of recurrent CV thrombotic events. If NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN and NAPROXEN SODIUM are used in patients with a recent MI, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia. 5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation NSAIDs, including naproxen cause serious gastrointestinal ( GI ) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occured in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3-6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk. Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) ; smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding. Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients: Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration. Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Elevations of ALT or AST ( three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN] ) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure have been reported. Elevations of ALT or AST ( less than three times ULN ) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including naproxen. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity ( e.g. , nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and \"flu-like\" symptoms ) . If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur ( e.g. , eosinophilia, rash, etc. ) , discontinue NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient. 5.4 Hypertension NSAIDs, including NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Monitor blood pressure ( BP ) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy. 5.5 Heart Failure and Edema The Coxib and traditional NSAID Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrated an approximately two-fold increase in hospitalization for heart failure in COX-2 selective-treated patients and nonselective NSAID-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death. Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs. Use of naproxen may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions ( e.g. , diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] ) [see . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Avoid the use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure. Since each NAPROXEN SODIUM tablet contains 50 mg of sodium ( about 2 mEq per each 500 mg of naproxen ) , this should be considered in patients whose overall intake of sodium must be severely restricted. 5.6 Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia Renal Toxicity Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, dehydration, hypovolemia, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM in patients with advanced renal disease. The renal effects of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM may hasten the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with preexisting renal disease. Correct volume status in dehydrated or hypovolemic patients prior to initiating NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, dehydration, or hypovolemia during use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM [ see ] . Avoid the use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM in patients with advanced renal disease unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening renal function. If NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM is used in patients with advanced renal disease, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Drug Interactions ( 7 ) Hyperkalemia Increases in serum potassium concentration, including hyperkalemia, have been reported with use of NSAIDs, even in some patients without renal impairment. In patients with normal renal function, these effects have been attributed to a hyporeninemic-hypoaldosteronism state. 5.7 Anaphylactic Reactions Naproxen has been associated with anaphylactic reactions in patients with and without known hypersensitivity to naproxen and in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma [ see and Contraindications ( 4 ) ] . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) Seek emergency help if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.8 Exacerbation of Asthma Related to Aspirin Sensitivity A subpopulation of patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma which may include chronic rhinosinusitis complicated by nasal polyps; severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm; and/or intolerance to aspirin and other NSAIDs. Because cross-reactivity between aspirin and other NSAIDs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM are contraindicated in patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity [ see ] . When NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM is used in patients with preexisting asthma ( without known aspirin sensitivity ) , monitor patients for changes in the signs and symptoms of asthma. Contraindications ( 4 ) 5.9 Serious Skin Reactions NSAIDs, including naproxen, can cause serious skin adverse reactions such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome ( SJS ) , and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , which can be fatal. These serious events may occur without warning. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions, and to discontinue the use of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM are contraindicated in patients with previous serious skin reactions to NSAIDs [ see ] . Contraindications ( 4 ) 5.10 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) has been reported in patients taking NSAIDs such as NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling. Other clinical manifestations may include hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis. Sometimes symptoms of DRESS may resemble an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its presentation, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, discontinue NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM and evaluate the patient immediately. 5.11 Fetal Toxicity Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus: Avoid use of NSAIDs, including NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM, in pregnant women at about 30 weeks of gestation and later. NSAIDs, including NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM, increase the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus at approximately this gestational age. Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment: Use of NSAIDs, including NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM, at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment, although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation. Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function, invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required. If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM treatment extends beyond 48 hours. Discontinue NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to clinical practice [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 ) ] 5.12 Hematologic Toxicity Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, or NAPROXEN SODIUM has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit. NSAIDs, including NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents ( e.g. , aspirin ) , serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [ see ] . Drug Interactions ( 7 ) 5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever The pharmacological activity of NAPROXEN Tablets, EC-NAPROXEN, and NAPROXEN SODIUM in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections. 5.14 Long-Term Use and Laboratory Monitoring Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodica ly [ see ] . Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 , 5.6 ) Patients with initial hemoglobin values of 10 g or less who are to receive long-term therapy should have hemoglobin values determined periodically. Because of adverse eye findings in animal studies with drugs of this class, it is recommended that ophthalmic studies be carried out if any change or disturbance in vision occurs.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] GI Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ] Heart Failure and Edema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ) ] Anaphylactic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 ) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] Hematologic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 ) ] Most common adverse reactions to naproxen were dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, rash, ecchymosis, and edema. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Woodward Pharma Services LLC at 1-888-514-4727 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse reactions reported in controlled clinical trials in 960 patients treated for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis are listed below. In general, reactions in patients treated chronically were reported 2 to 10 times more frequently than they were in short-term studies in the 962 patients treated for mild to moderate pain or for dysmenorrhea. The most frequent complaints reported related to the gastrointestinal tract. A clinical study found gastrointestinal reactions to be more frequent and more severe in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking daily doses of 1500 mg naproxen compared to those taking 750 mg naproxen. In controlled clinical trials with about 80 pediatric patients and in well-monitored, open-label studies with about 400 pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with naproxen, the incidence of rash and prolonged bleeding times were greater, the incidence of gastrointestinal and central nervous system reactions were about the same, and the incidence of other reactions were lower in pediatric patients than in adults. In patients taking naproxen in clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse experiences in approximately 1% to 10% of patients were: Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Experiences, including: heartburn * , abdominal pain * , nausea * , constipation * , diarrhea, dyspepsia, stomatitis C entral Nervous System: headache * , dizziness * , drowsiness * , lightheadedness, vertigo Dermatologic: pruritus ( itching ) * , skin eruptions * , ecchymoses * , sweating, purpura Special Senses: tinnitus * , visual disturbances, hearing disturbances C ardiovascular: edema * , palpitations General: dyspnea * , thirst * Incidence of reported reaction between 3% and 9% . Those reactions occurring in less than 3% of the patients are unmarked. In patients taking NSAIDs, the following adverse experiences have also been reported in approximately 1% to 10% of patients. Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Experiences, including: flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, GI ulcers ( gastric/duodenal ) , vomiting General: abnormal renal function, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, increased bleeding time, rashes The following are additional adverse experiences reported in <1% of patients taking naproxen during clinical trials. Gastrointestinal: pancreatitis, vomiting Hepatobiliary: jaundice Hemic and Lymphatic: melena, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis Nervous System: inability to concentrate Dermatologic: skin rashes 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of naproxen. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following are additional adverse experiences reported in <1% of patients taking naproxen during clinical trials and through postmarketing reports. Those adverse reactions observed through postmarketing reports are italicized. Body as a Whole: anaphylactoid reactions, angioneurotic edema, menstrual disorders, pyrexia ( chills and fever ) Cardiovascular: congestive heart failure, vasculitis, hypertension, pulmonary edema Gastrointestinal: inflammation, bleeding ( sometimes fatal, particularly in the elderly ) , ulceration, perforation and obstruction of the upper or lower gastrointestinal tract.
