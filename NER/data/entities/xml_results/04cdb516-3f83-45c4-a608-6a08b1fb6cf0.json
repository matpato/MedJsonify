( 5.1 ) \u2022\u00a0Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, in cases of alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia, or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min). ( 5.1 ) \u2022\u00a0Risk of Serious Skin or Hypersensitivity Reactions: Discontinue Acetaminophen Injection immediately at the first appearance of skin rash and if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occur. Do not use in patients with acetaminophen allergy. ( 5.2 , 5.4 ) \u2022\u00a0Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering Acetaminophen Injection to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Hepatic Injury Administration of acetaminophen in doses higher than recommended may result in hepatic injury, including the risk of liver failure and death [see Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen Overdosage (10) ]. [see The maximum recommended daily dose of acetaminophen includes all routes of acetaminophen administration and all acetaminophen-containing products administered, including combination products. Dosage and Administration (2) ]. Use caution when administering acetaminophen in patients with the following conditions: hepatic impairment or active hepatic disease, alcoholism, chronic malnutrition, severe hypovolemia (e.g., due to dehydration or blood loss), or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min) [see Use In Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7 )]. 5.2 Serious Skin Reactions Rarely, acetaminophen may cause serious skin reactions such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which can be fatal. Patients should be informed about the signs of serious skin reactions, and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. 5.3 Risk of Medication Errors Take care when prescribing, preparing, and administering Acetaminophen Injection in order to avoid dosing errors which could result in accidental overdose and death. In particular, be careful to ensure that: \u2022\u00a0 the dose in milligrams (mg) and milliliters (mL) is not confused; \u2022\u00a0 the dosing is based on weight for patients under 50 kg; \u2022\u00a0 infusion pumps are properly programmed; and \u2022\u00a0 the total daily dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed maximum daily limits [see Dosage and Administration (2) ]. 5.4 Allergy and Hypersensitivity There have been post-marketing reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis associated with the use of acetaminophen. Clinical signs included swelling of the face, mouth, and throat, respiratory distress, urticaria, rash, and pruritus. There were infrequent reports of life-threatening anaphylaxis requiring emergent medical attention. Discontinue Acetaminophen Injection immediately if symptoms associated with allergy or hypersensitivity occur. Do not use Acetaminophen Injection in patients with acetaminophen allergy.",

Adult Population A total of 1,020 adult patients have received Acetaminophen Injection in clinical trials, including 37.3% (n=380) who received 5 or more doses, and 17.0% (n=173) who received more than 10 doses. Most patients were treated with Acetaminophen Injection 1,000 mg every 6 hours. A total of 13.1% (n=134) received Acetaminophen Injection 650 mg every 4 hours. All adverse reactions that occurred in adult patients treated with either Acetaminophen Injection or placebo in repeated dose, placebo-controlled clinical trials at an incidence greater than or equal to 3% and at a greater frequency than placebo are listed in Table 4. The most common adverse events in adult patients treated with Acetaminophen Injection (incidence greater than or equal to 5% and greater than placebo) were nausea, vomiting, headache, and insomnia.
