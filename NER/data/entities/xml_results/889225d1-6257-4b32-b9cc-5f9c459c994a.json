SIMBRINZA is a combination of brinzolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and brimonidine tartrate, an alpha adrenergic agonist, indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. (4.1) Neonates and infants (under the age of two years). (4.2) 4.1 Hypersensitivity SIMBRINZA is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. 4.2 Neonates and Infants (under the age of two years) SIMBRINZA is contraindicated in neonates and infants (under the age of two years ) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Potential for sulfonamide hypersensitivity reactions because of the brinzolamide\u00a0component (5.1) Potential for corneal endothelium cell loss (5.2) Severe renal impairment may limit the metabolism of the brinzolamide\u00a0component (5.3) 5.1 Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity Reactions SIMBRINZA contains brinzolamide, a sulfonamide, and although administered topically is absorbed systemically. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topical administration of SIMBRINZA. Fatalities have occurred due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is re-administered irrespective of the route of administration. If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this preparation immediately. [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. 5.2 Corneal Endothelium Carbonic anhydrase activity has been observed in both the cytoplasm and around the plasma membranes of the corneal endothelium. There is an increased potential for developing corneal edema in patients with low endothelial cell counts. Caution should be used when prescribing SIMBRINZA to this group of patients. 5.3 Severe Renal Impairment SIMBRINZA has not been specifically studied in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL/min). \u00a0Since brinzolamide and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by the kidney, SIMBRINZA is not recommended in such patients. 5.4 Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma The management of patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma requires therapeutic interventions in addition to ocular hypotensive agents. SIMBRINZA has not been studied in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma. 5.5 Contact Lens Wear The preservative in SIMBRINZA, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed during instillation of SIMBRINZA but may be reinserted 15 minutes after instillation [see . Patient Counseling Information (17) ] 5.6 Severe Cardiovascular Disease Brimonidine tartrate, a component of SIMBRINZA, has a less than 5% mean decrease in blood pressure two hours after dosing in clinical studies; caution should be exercised in treating patients with severe cardiovascular disease. 5.7 Severe Hepatic Impairment Because brimonidine tartrate, a component of SIMBRINZA, has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised in such patients. 5.8 Potentiation of Vascular Insufficiency Brimonidine tartrate, a component of SIMBRINZA, may potentiate syndromes associated with vascular insufficiency. SIMBRINZA should be used with caution in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, or thromboangiitis obliterans. 5.9 Contamination of Topical Ophthalmic Products After Use There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers have been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see .

    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions occurring in approximately 3% to 5% of patients included\u00a0blurred vision, eye irritation, dysgeusia (bad taste), dry mouth, eye allergy. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alcon Laboratories, Inc. at 1-800-757-9195 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In two clinical trials of three months duration 435 patients were treated with SIMBRINZA, and 915 were treated with the two individual components. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in patients treated with SIMBRINZA occurring in approximately 3% to 5% of patients in descending order of incidence were blurred vision, eye irritation, dysgeusia (bad taste), dry mouth, and eye allergy. Rates of adverse reactions reported with the individual components were comparable. Treatment discontinuation, mainly due to adverse reactions, was reported in 11% of SIMBRINZA patients. SIMBRINZA Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components during clinical trials are listed below. In clinical studies of brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension 1%, the most frequently reported adverse reactions reported in 5% to 10% of patients were blurred vision and bitter, sour or unusual taste. Adverse reactions occurring in 1% to 5% of patients were blepharitis, dermatitis, dry eye, foreign body sensation, headache, hyperemia, ocular discharge, ocular discomfort, ocular keratitis, ocular pain, ocular pruritus and rhinitis. Brinzolamide 1% The following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence below 1%: allergic reactions, alopecia, chest pain, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, diplopia, dizziness, dry mouth, dyspnea, dyspepsia, eye fatigue, hypertonia, keratoconjunctivitis, keratopathy, kidney pain, lid margin crusting or sticky sensation, nausea, pharyngitis, tearing and urticaria. Brimonidine Tartrate 0.2% In clinical studies of brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, adverse reactions occurring in approximately 10% to 30% of the subjects, in descending order of incidence, included oral dryness, ocular hyperemia, burning and stinging, headache, blurring, foreign body sensation, fatigue/drowsiness, conjunctival follicles, ocular allergic reactions, and ocular pruritus. Reactions occurring in approximately 3% to 9% of the subjects, in descending order included corneal staining/erosion, photophobia, eyelid erythema, ocular ache/pain, ocular dryness, tearing, upper respiratory symptoms, eyelid edema, conjunctival edema, dizziness, blepharitis, ocular irritation, gastrointestinal symptoms, asthenia, conjunctival blanching, abnormal vision and muscular pain. The following adverse reactions were reported in less than 3% of the patients: lid crusting, conjunctival hemorrhage, abnormal taste, insomnia, conjunctival discharge, depression, hypertension, anxiety, palpitations/arrhythmias, nasal dryness and syncope. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Brinzolamide The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of brinzolamide containing products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Serious skin and subcutaneous tissue reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) may occur with the use of brinzolamide due to the sulfonamide component [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information Sulfonamide Reactions (17) ]. Brimonidine Tartrate The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness, frequency of reporting, possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions, or a combination of these factors, include: bradycardia, hypersensitivity, iritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, miosis, nausea, skin reactions (including erythema, eyelid pruritus, rash, and vasodilation), and tachycardia. Apnea, bradycardia, coma, hypotension, hypothermia, hypotonia, lethargy, pallor, respiratory depression, and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions [see .
