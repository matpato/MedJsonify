    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Tuberculosis Rifabutin capsules must not be administered for MAC prophylaxis to patients with active tuberculosis. Patients who develop complaints consistent with active tuberculosis while on prophylaxis with rifabutin should be evaluated immediately, so that those with active disease may be given an effective combination regimen of anti-tuberculosis medications. Administration of rifabutin as a single agent to patients with active tuberculosis is likely to lead to the development of tuberculosis that is resistant both to rifabutin and to rifampin. There is no evidence that rifabutin is an effective prophylaxis against M. tuberculosis . Patients requiring prophylaxis against both M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium complex may be given isoniazid and rifabutin concurrently. Tuberculosis in HIV-positive patients is common and may present with atypical or extrapulmonary findings. Patients are likely to have a nonreactive purified protein derivative (PPD) despite active disease. In addition to chest X-ray and sputum culture, the following studies may be useful in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the HIV-positive patient: blood culture, urine culture, or biopsy of a suspicious lymph node. MAC Treatment with Clarithromycin When rifabutin is used concomitantly with clarithromycin for MAC treatment, a decreased dose of rifabutin is recommended due to the increase in plasma concentrations of rifabutin (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions, Table 2 ). Hypersensitivity and Related Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions may occur in patients receiving rifamycins. Signs and symptoms of these reactions may include hypotension, urticaria, angioedema, acute bronchospasm, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or flu-like syndrome (weakness, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, chills, aches, rash, itching, sweats, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, syncope, palpitations). There have been reports of anaphylaxis with the use of rifamycins. Monitor patients receiving rifabutin therapy for signs and/or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If these symptoms occur, administer supportive measures and discontinue rifabutin. Uveitis Due to the possible occurrence of uveitis, patients should also be carefully monitored when rifabutin is given in combination with clarithromycin (or other macrolides) and/or fluconazole and related compounds (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions, Table 2 ). If uveitis is suspected, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist and, if considered necessary, treatment with rifabutin should be suspended (see also ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Clostridioides difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including rifabutin capsules and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions There have been reports of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) associated with rifabutin (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). If patients develop a skin rash they should be monitored closely, and rifabutin discontinued if lesions progress. Specifically, for DRESS, a multi-system potential life-threatening SCAR, time to onset of the first symptoms may be prolonged. DRESS is a clinical diagnosis, and its clinical presentation remains the basis for decision making. An early withdrawal of rifabutin is essential because of the syndrome\u2019s mortality and visceral involvement (e.g., liver, bone marrow or kidney). Antiretroviral and Anti-HCV Drug Interactions Protease inhibitors act as substrates or inhibitors of CYP3A4 mediated metabolism. Therefore, due to significant drug-drug interactions between protease inhibitors and rifabutin, their concomitant use should be based on the overall assessment of the patient and a patient-specific drug profile. The concomitant use of protease inhibitors may require at least a 50% reduction in rifabutin dose, and depending on the protease inhibitor, an adjustment of the antiretroviral drug dose. Increased monitoring for adverse events is recommended when using these drug combinations (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). Rifabutin is a CYP3A inducer. Co-administration with antiretroviral drugs metabolized by CYP3A, including but not limited to products containing bictegravir, elvitegravir, oral rilpivirine, or doravirine and anti-HCV drugs including but not limited to sofosbuvir (alone or in combination) may decrease plasma concentrations of those drugs, which may lead to loss of virologic response and possible development of resistance. Therefore, co-administration with antiretroviral and anti-HCV drugs metabolized by CYP3A is not recommended or there may be a need to increase the dose of antiretroviral or anti-HCV drugs (see PRECAUTIONS-Drug Interactions ). For further recommendations, please refer to the most recent prescribing information of the antiretrovirals or anti-HCV drugs or contact the specific manufacturer.PRECAUTIONS GENERAL PRECAUTIONS Because treatment with rifabutin capsules may be associated with neutropenia, and more rarely thrombocytopenia, physicians should consider obtaining hematologic studies periodically in patients receiving prophylaxis with rifabutin. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of both MAC and tuberculosis, and should be instructed to consult their physicians if they develop new complaints consistent with either of these diseases. In addition, since rifabutin may rarely be associated with myositis and uveitis, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they develop signs or symptoms suggesting either of these disorders. Urine, feces, saliva, sputum, perspiration, tears, and skin may be colored brown-orange with rifabutin and some of its metabolites. Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained. Patients to be treated with rifabutin should be made aware of these possibilities. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterials which usually ends when the antibacterial is discontinued. Sometimes, after starting treatment with antibacterials, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. DRUG INTERACTIONS Effect of Rifabutin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Rifabutin induces CYP3A enzymes and therefore may reduce the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by those enzymes. This effect may reduce the efficacy of standard doses of such drugs, which include itraconazole, clarithromycin, and saquinavir. Effect of Other Drugs on Rifabutin Pharmacokinetics Some drugs that inhibit CYP3A may significantly increase the plasma concentration of rifabutin. Therefore, carefully monitor for rifabutin associated adverse events in those patients also receiving CYP3A inhibitors, which include fluconazole and clarithromycin. In some cases, the dosage of rifabutin may need to be reduced when it is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors. Table 2 summarizes the results and magnitude of the pertinent drug interactions assessed with rifabutin. The clinical relevance of these interactions and subsequent dose modifications should be judged in light of the population studied, severity of the disease, patient's drug profile, and the likely impact on the risk/benefit ratio.

Although a weaker enzyme inducer than rifampin, rifabutin may be expected to have some effect on those drugs as well. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Long-term carcinogenicity studies were conducted with rifabutin in mice and in rats. Rifabutin was not carcinogenic in mice at doses up to 180 mg/kg/day, or approximately 36 times the recommended human daily dose. Rifabutin was not carcinogenic in the rat at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day, about 12 times the recommended human dose. Rifabutin was not mutagenic in the bacterial mutation assay (Ames Test) using both rifabutin-susceptible and resistant strains. Rifabutin was not mutagenic in Schizosaccharomyces pombe P and was not genotoxic in V-79 Chinese hamster cells, human lymphocytes 1 in vitro , or mouse bone marrow cells in vivo . Fertility was impaired in male rats given 160 mg/kg (32 times the recommended human daily dose). PREGNANCY Rifabutin should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Reproduction studies have been carried out in rats and rabbits given rifabutin using dose levels up to 200 mg/kg (about 6 to 13 times the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons). No teratogenicity was observed in either species. In rats, given 200 mg/kg/day, (about 6 times the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons), there was a decrease in fetal viability. In rats, at 40 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons), rifabutin caused an increase in fetal skeletal variants. In rabbits, at 80 mg/kg/day (about 5 times the recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons), rifabutin caused maternotoxicity and increase in fetal skeletal anomalies. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, rifabutin should be used in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether rifabutin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness of rifabutin for prophylaxis of MAC in children have not been established. Limited safety data are available from treatment use in 22 HIV-positive children with MAC who received rifabutin in combination with at least two other antimycobacterials for periods from 1 to 183 weeks. Mean doses (mg/kg) for these children were: 18.5 (range 15.0 to 25.0) for infants 1 year of age, 8.6 (range 4.4 to 18.8) for children 2 to 10 years of age, and 4.0 (range 2.8 to 5.4) for adolescents 14 to 16 years of age. There is no evidence that doses greater than 5 mg/kg daily are useful. Adverse experiences were similar to those observed in the adult population, and included leukopenia, neutropenia, and rash. In addition, corneal deposits have been observed in some patients during routine ophthalmologic surveillance of HIV-positive pediatric patients receiving rifabutin as part of a multiple-drug regimen for MAC prophylaxis. These are tiny, almost transparent, asymptomatic peripheral and central corneal deposits which do not impair vision. GERIATRIC USE Clinical studies of rifabutin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ).",

The following adverse events have occurred in more than one patient receiving rifabutin, but an etiologic role has not been established: seizure, paresthesia, aphasia, confusion, and non-specific T wave changes on electrocardiogram. When rifabutin was administered at doses from 1050 mg/day to 2400 mg/day, generalized arthralgia and uveitis were reported. These adverse experiences abated when rifabutin was discontinued. Mild to severe, reversible uveitis has been reported less frequently when rifabutin is used at 300 mg as monotherapy in MAC prophylaxis versus rifabutin in combination with clarithromycin for MAC treatment (see also WARNINGS ). Uveitis has been infrequently reported when rifabutin is used at 300 mg/day as monotherapy in MAC prophylaxis of HIV-infected persons, even with the concomitant use of fluconazole and/or macrolide antibacterials. However, if higher doses of rifabutin are administered in combination with these agents, the incidence of uveitis is higher. Patients who developed uveitis had mild to severe symptoms that resolved after treatment with corticosteroids and/or mydriatic eye drops; in some severe cases, however, resolution of symptoms occurred after several weeks. When uveitis occurs, temporary discontinuance of rifabutin and ophthalmologic evaluation are recommended. In most mild cases, rifabutin may be restarted; however, if signs or symptoms recur, use of rifabutin should be discontinued (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, September 9, 1994). Corneal deposits have been reported during routine ophthalmologic surveillance of some HIV-positive pediatric patients receiving rifabutin as part of a multiple drug regimen for MAC prophylaxis. The deposits are tiny, almost transparent, asymptomatic peripheral and central corneal deposits, and do not impair vision. The following table enumerates the changes in laboratory values that were considered as laboratory abnormalities in Studies 023 and 027. Table 4 Percentage of Patients With Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities Rifabutin (n = 566) % PLACEBO (n = 580) % Chemistry Increased alkaline phosphatase 1 <1 3 Increased SGOT 2 7 12 Increased SGPT 2 9 11 Hematology Anemia 3 6 7 Eosinophilia 1 1 Leukopenia 4 17 16 Neutropenia 5 25 20 Thrombocytopenia 6 5 4 Includes grades 3 or 4 toxicities as specified: 1 All values >450 U/L 2 All values >150 U/L 3 All hemoglobin values <8.0 g/dL 4 All WBC values <1,500/mm 3 5 All ANC values <750/mm 3 6 All platelet count values <50,000/mm 3 The incidence of neutropenia in patients treated with rifabutin was significantly greater than in patients treated with placebo (p = 0.03). Although thrombocytopenia was not significantly more common among patients treated with rifabutin in these trials, rifabutin has been clearly linked to thrombocytopenia in rare cases. One patient in Study 023 developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which was attributed to rifabutin. Adverse Reactions from Post-Marketing Experience Adverse reactions identified through post-marketing surveillance by system organ class (SOC) are listed below: Blood and lymphatic system disorders: White blood cell disorders (including agranulocytosis, lymphopenia, granulocytopenia, neutropenia, white blood cell count decreased, neutrophil count decreased), platelet count decreased. Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity, bronchospasm, rash, and eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders: Clostridioides difficile colitis/ Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea. Pyrexia, rash and other hypersensitivity reactions such as eosinophilia and bronchospasm might occur, as has been seen with other antibacterials. A limited occurrence of skin discoloration has been reported. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) Rifabutin has been associated with the occurrence of DRESS as well as other SCARs such as SJS, TEN, and AGEP (see WARNINGS ). Rifamycin hypersensitivity reactions Hypersensitivity to rifamycins have been reported including flu-like symptoms, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, angioedema, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia.",
