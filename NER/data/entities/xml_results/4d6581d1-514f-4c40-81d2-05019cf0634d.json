    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Monitor serum total bilirubin and AST levels before and during treatment with ELLENCE. In patients with elevated serum AST or serum total bilirubin, dosage reductions or discontinuation may be required ( 2.3 , 5.5 ). \u2022 Tumor Lysis Syndrome: Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Consider hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to minimize potential complications of hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome ( 5.7 ). \u2022 Thrombophlebitis and Thromboembolic Events: Thrombophlebitis and thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolism (in some cases fatal) have been reported with the use of ELLENCE. Venous sclerosis may result from an injection into a small vessel or from repeated injections into the same vein ( 5.9 ). \u2022 Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by chemotherapeutic agents including ELLENCE, may result in serious or fatal infections ( 5.7 ). \u2022 Potentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall: Administration of ELLENCE after previous radiation therapy may induce an inflammatory recall reaction at the site of the irradiation ( 5.10 ). \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ELLENCE can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5.11 , 8.1 , 8.3 ). 5.1\tCardiac Toxicity ELLENCE and other anthracycline drugs can result in either early (or acute) or late (delayed) cardiac toxicity. The principal manifestations of early cardiac toxicity are sinus tachycardia and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities such as non-specific ST-T wave changes. However, tachycardia (including premature ventricular contractions and ventricular tachycardia), bradycardia, as well as atrioventricular and bundle-branch block have been reported. Early cardiac toxicity does not usually predict the subsequent occurrence of delayed cardiotoxicity and generally should not be considered a reason for suspending treatment with ELLENCE. Delayed cardiac toxicity is manifested by reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and/or signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF). If it occurs, late cardiotoxicity usually develops late during therapy with ELLENCE or within 2 to 3 months after completion of treatment, but there are reports of it occurring several months to years after treatment termination. In a retrospective survey, including 9144 patients, mostly with solid tumors in advanced stages, the probability of developing CHF increased with increasing cumulative doses of ELLENCE (Figure 1). In another retrospective survey of 469 ELLENCE-treated patients with metastatic or early breast cancer, the reported risk of CHF was comparable to that observed in the larger study of over 9000 patients. Given the risk of cardiac toxicity, cumulative doses of 900 mg/m 2 ELLENCE should generally be avoided. Figure 1.\tRisk of CHF in 9144 Patients Treated with ELLENCE Prior history of cardiovascular disease, prior or concomitant radiotherapy to the mediastinal/pericardial area, previous therapy with other anthracyclines or anthracenediones, and concomitant use of other cardiotoxic drugs, increase the risk of developing late cardiac toxicity. Avoid administration of ELLENCE in combination with other cardiotoxic drugs. Although not formally tested, it is probable that the toxicity of ELLENCE and other anthracyclines or anthracenediones is additive. Cardiac toxicity with ELLENCE may occur at lower cumulative doses whether or not cardiac risk factors are present. Patients receiving ELLENCE after stopping treatment with other cardiotoxic drugs, especially those with long half-lives such as trastuzumab, may be at increased risk of developing cardiotoxicity [see . Dosage and Administration (2) and Drug Interaction (7.1) ] Perform a baseline ECG and evaluation of LVEF prior to initiating treatment with ELLENCE. Monitor LVEF during the course of treatment and consider discontinuation of ELLENCE if LVEF decrease and/or signs or symptoms of CHF develop. Closely monitor patients with other risk factors for cardiac toxicity, particularly prior administration of anthracycline or anthracenedione. Figure 1 5.2\tSecondary Malignancies The risk of developing secondary acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), is increased following treatment with ELLENCE and other anthracyclines. Cumulative risk of secondary acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) of about 0.27% at 3 years, 0.46% at 5 years, and 0.55% at 8 years. These leukemias generally occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.3\tExtravasation and Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of ELLENCE can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering, ulceration, and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting. Extravasation should be considered if a patient experiences a burning or stinging sensation or shows other evidence indicating peri-venous infiltration or extravasation; however, extravasation may be present in patients who do not experience a stinging or burning sensation or when blood return is present on aspiration of the infusion needle. Venous sclerosis may result from an injection into a small vessel or from repeated injections into the same vein. Administer ELLENCE slowly into the tubing of a freely running intravenous infusion. Patients receiving initial therapy at the recommended starting doses of 100\u2013120 mg/m 2 should have ELLENCE infused over 15\u201320 minutes. For patients who require lower ELLENCE starting doses due to organ dysfunction or who require modification of ELLENCE doses during therapy, the ELLENCE infusion time may be proportionally decreased, but should not be less than 3 minutes [see If possible, avoid veins over joints or in extremities with compromised venous or lymphatic drainage. Facial flushing, as well as local erythematous streaking along the vein, may be indicative of excessively rapid administration. It may precede local phlebitis or thrombophlebitis. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Immediately terminate infusion and restart in another vein if a burning or stinging sensation indicates perivenous infiltration. Perivenous infiltration may occur without causing pain. If extravasation is suspected, immediately discontinue the intravenous injection or continuous intravenous infusion [see . Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes, 4 times a day for 3 days. If appropriate, administer dexrazoxane at the site of extravasation as soon as possible and within the first 6 hours after extravasation. Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.4\tSevere Myelosuppression ELLENCE can cause severe myelosuppression [see . Obtain complete blood counts prior to each treatment and carefully monitor patients during treatment for possible clinical complications due to myelosuppression. Delay the next dose of ELLENCE if severe myelosuppression has not improved. Consider dose reduction for patients with prolonged myelosuppression based on the severity of reaction Adverse Reactions (6.1) [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] 5.5\tUse in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The major route of elimination of epirubicin is the hepatobiliary system [see . Evaluate serum total bilirubin and AST levels before and during treatment with ELLENCE. Patients with elevated bilirubin or AST may experience slower clearance of drug with an increase in overall toxicity. Lower doses are recommended in these patients Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] [see . Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated; therefore, do not use ELLENCE in this patient population Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] [see . Contraindications (4) ] 5.6\tUse in Patients with Renal Impairment Assess serum creatinine before and during therapy. Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with serum creatinine >5 mg/dL [see . Patients undergoing dialysis have not been studied. Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.7\tTumor-Lysis Syndrome ELLENCE can induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Evaluate blood uric acid levels, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine after initial treatment. Consider hydration, urine alkalinization, and prophylaxis with allopurinol to minimize hyperuricemia and potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome. 5.8\tImmunosuppressant Effects/Increased Susceptibility to Infections Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by chemotherapeutic agents including epirubicin, may result in serious or fatal infections. Avoid vaccination with a live vaccine in patients receiving ELLENCE. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered; however, the response to such vaccines may be diminished. 5.9\tThrombophlebitis and Thromboembolic Events Thrombophlebitis and thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolism (in some cases fatal) have been reported with the use of ELLENCE. 5.10\tPotentiation of Radiation Toxicity and Radiation Recall ELLENCE can increase radiation-induced toxicity to the myocardium, mucosa, skin, and liver. Radiation recall, including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity, can occur in patients who receive ELLENCE after prior radiation therapy. 5.11\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animals and its mechanism of action, ELLENCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman; avoid the use of ELLENCE during the 1 st trimester. Available human data do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects and miscarriage related to the use of epirubicin during the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters. In animal reproduction studies, epirubicin was embryo-fetal lethal and caused structural abnormalities in rats and rabbits at doses less than the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of ELLENCE. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of ELLENCE. Advise male patients with pregnant partners to use condoms during treatment and for at least 7 days after the last dose of ELLENCE [see .

The safety of ELLENCE was evaluated in two studies (Studies MA-5 and GFEA-05) evaluating combination regimens in patients with early breast cancer [see . Of the 1260 patients treated in these studies, 620 patients received the higher-dose ELLENCE regimen (FEC-100/CEF-120), 280 patients received the lower-dose ELLENCE regimen (FEC-50), and 360 patients received CMF. Serotonin-specific antiemetic therapy and colony-stimulating factors were not used in these trials. Clinically relevant adverse reactions are summarized in Table 1. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Table 1.

Table 2. Long-Term Adverse Reactions in Patients with Early Breast Cancer Event % of Patients FEC-100/CEF-120 (N=620) FEC-50 (N=280) CMF (N=360) Two cases of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) were also observed in patients receiving ELLENCE. However, an association between anthracyclines such as ELLENCE and ALL has not been clearly established. Cardiac events Asymptomatic drops in LVEF 2.1 In study MA-5, cardiac function was not monitored after 5 years. 1.4 0.8 CHF 1.5 0.4 0.3 Leukemia AML 0.8 0 0.3 Hematologic Dose-dependent, reversible leukopenia and/or neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity associated with ELLENCE and represents the most common acute dose-limiting toxicity of this drug. In most cases, the white blood cell (WBC) nadir is reached 10 to 14 days from drug administration. Leukopenia/neutropenia is usually transient, with WBC and neutrophil counts generally returning to normal values by Day 21 after drug administration. As with other cytotoxic agents, ELLENCE at the recommended dose in combination with cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil can produce severe leukopenia and neutropenia. Severe thrombocytopenia and anemia may also occur. Clinical consequences of severe myelosuppression include fever, infection, septicemia, septic shock, hemorrhage, tissue hypoxia, symptomatic anemia, or death. If myelosuppressive complications occur, use appropriate supportive measures (e.g., intravenous antibiotics, colony-stimulating factors, transfusions). Myelosuppression requires careful monitoring. Assess total and differential WBC, red blood cell (RBC), and platelet counts before and during each cycle of therapy with ELLENCE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Gastrointestinal A dose-dependent mucositis (mainly oral stomatitis, less often esophagitis) may occur in patients treated with ELLENCE. Clinical manifestations of mucositis may include a pain or burning sensation, erythema, erosions, ulcerations, bleeding, or infections. Mucositis generally appears early after drug administration and, if severe, may progress over a few days to mucosal ulcerations; most patients recover from this adverse event by the third week of therapy. Hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa may also occur. Nausea, vomiting, and occasionally diarrhea and abdominal pain can also occur. Severe vomiting and diarrhea may produce dehydration. Antiemetics may reduce nausea and vomiting; consider prophylactic use of antiemetics before therapy [see . Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] Cutaneous and Hypersensitivity Reactions Alopecia occurs frequently, but is usually reversible, with hair regrowth occurring within 2 to 3 months from the termination of therapy. Flushes, skin and nail hyperpigmentation, photosensitivity, and hypersensitivity to irradiated skin (radiation-recall reaction) have been observed. Urticaria and anaphylaxis have been reported in patients treated with ELLENCE; signs and symptoms of these reactions may vary from skin rash and pruritus to fever, chills, and shock. Cardiovascular Serious drug-related cardiovascular adverse events that occurred during clinical trials with ELLENCE, administered in different indications, include ventricular tachycardia, AV block, bundle branch block, bradycardia and thromboembolism. Secondary Leukemia An analysis of 7110 patients who received adjuvant treatment with ELLENCE in controlled clinical trials as a component of poly-chemotherapy regimens for early breast cancer, showed a cumulative risk of secondary acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) of about 0.27% (approximate 95% CI, 0.14\u20130.40) at 3 years, 0.46% (approximate 95% CI, 0.28\u20130.65) at 5 years, and 0.55% (approximate 95% CI, 0.33\u20130.78) at 8 years. The risk of developing AML/MDS increased with increasing ELLENCE cumulative doses as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2.\tRisk of AML/MDS in 7110 Patients Treated with ELLENCE The cumulative probability of developing AML/MDS was found to be particularly increased in patients who received more than the maximum recommended cumulative dose of ELLENCE (720 mg/m 2 ) or cyclophosphamide (6,300 mg/m 2 ), as shown in Table 3. Table 3.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and infestations: sepsis, pneumonia Immune system disorders: anaphylaxis Metabolism and nutrition disorders: dehydration, hyperuricemia Vascular disorders: shock, hemorrhage, embolism arterial, thrombophlebitis, phlebitis Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pulmonary embolism Gastrointestinal disorders: erosions, ulcerations, pain or burning sensation, bleeding, hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: erythema, flushes, skin and nail hyperpigmentation, photosensitivity, hypersensitivity to irradiated skin (radiation-recall reaction), urticaria Renal and urinary disorders: red coloration of urine for 1 to 2 days after administration General disorders and administration site conditions: fever, chills Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: chemical cystitis (following intravesical administration)",
