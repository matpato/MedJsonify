    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diarrhea: VERZENIO can cause severe cases of diarrhea, associated with dehydration and infection. Instruct patients at the first sign of loose stools to initiate antidiarrheal therapy, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) Neutropenia: Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. ( 2.2 , 5.2 ) Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis: Severe and fatal cases of ILD/pneumonitis have been reported. Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes indicative of ILD/pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue VERZENIO in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis. ( 2.2 , 5.3 ) Hepatotoxicity: Increases in serum transaminase levels have been observed. Perform liver function tests (LFTs) before initiating treatment with VERZENIO. Monitor LFTs every two weeks for the first two months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. ( 2.2 , 5.4 ) Venous Thromboembolism: Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. ( 2.2 , 5.5 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Diarrhea Severe diarrhea associated with dehydration and infection occurred in patients treated with VERZENIO. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, diarrhea occurred in 81% to 90% of patients who received VERZENIO. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 8% to 20% of patients receiving VERZENIO [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Most patients experienced diarrhea during the first month of VERZENIO treatment. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event ranged from 6 to 8 days; and the median duration of Grade 2 and Grade 3 diarrhea ranged from 6 to 11 days and 5 to 8 days, respectively. Across trials, 19% to 26% of patients with diarrhea required a VERZENIO dose interruption and 13% to 23% required a dose reduction. Instruct patients to start antidiarrheal therapy such as loperamide at the first sign of loose stools, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow up [see Patient Counseling Information ( For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue VERZENIO until toxicity resolves to \u2264Grade 1, and then resume VERZENIO at the next lower dose 17 )]. [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.2 Neutropenia Neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis, occurred in patients treated with VERZENIO. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, neutropenia occurred in a 37% to 46% of patients receiving VERZENIO. A Grade \u22653 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 19% to 32% of patients receiving VERZENIO. Across trials, the median time to the first episode of Grade \u22653 neutropenia ranged from 29 days to 33 days, and the median duration of Grade \u22653 neutropenia ranged from 11 days to 16 days [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] Febrile neutropenia has been reported in <1% of patients exposed to VERZENIO across trials. Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider [see Patient Counseling Information ( . 17 )] Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or Pneumonitis Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with VERZENIO and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. In VERZENIO-treated patients in early breast cancer (monarchE, N=2791), 3% of patients experienced ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.4% were Grade 3 or 4 and there was one fatality (0.1%). In VERZENIO-treated patients in advanced or metastatic breast cancer (N=900) (MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), 3.3% of VERZENIO-treated patients had ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.6% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.4% had fatal outcomes. Additional cases of ILD or pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis. Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Dose interruption or dose reduction is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 ILD or pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue VERZENIO in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.4 Hepatotoxicity Grade \u22653 ALT (2% to 6%) and AST (2% to 3%) were reported in patients receiving VERZENIO. Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), the median time to onset of Grade \u22653 ALT increases ranged from 57 to 87 days and the median time to resolution to Grade <3 was 13 to 14 days. The median time to onset of Grade \u22653 AST increases ranged from 71 to 185 days and the median time to resolution to Grade <3 ranged from 11 to 15 days. Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or any Grade 3 or Grade 4 hepatic transaminase elevation [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.5 Venous Thromboembolism Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), venous thromboembolic events were reported in 2% to 5% of patients treated with VERZENIO. Venous thromboembolic events included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. In clinical trials, deaths due to venous thromboembolism have been reported in patients treated with VERZENIO. VERZENIO has not been studied in patients with early breast cancer who had a history of venous thromboembolism. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. Dose interruption is recommended for early breast cancer patients with any grade venous thromboembolic event and for advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients with a Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic event [see Dosage and Administration ( . 2.2 )] 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, VERZENIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VERZENIO and for 3\u00a0weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.1 , 8.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )]",

The safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to VERZENIO in 3691 patients from four clinical trials: monarchE, MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3. The safety population includes exposure to VERZENIO as a single agent at 200 mg twice daily in 132 patients in MONARCH 1 and to VERZENIO at 150 mg twice daily in 3559 patients administered in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor in monarchE, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3. The median duration of exposure ranged from 4.5 months in MONARCH 1 to 24 months in monarchE. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) across clinical trials were: diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. Early Breast Cancer monarchE: VERZENIO in Combination with Tamoxifen or an Aromatase Inhibitor as Adjuvant Treatment Adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence The safety of VERZENIO was evaluated in monarchE, a study of 5591 adult patients receiving VERZENIO plus endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) or endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) alone [see Clinical Studies ( Patients were randomly assigned to receive 150\u00a0mg of VERZENIO orally, twice daily, plus tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, or tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, for two years or until discontinuation criteria were met. The median duration of VERZENIO treatment was 24 months. 14.1 )]. The most frequently reported (\u22655%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, and lymphopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients who received VERZENIO plus endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor), including: cardiac failure (0.1%), cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, pneumonitis, hypoxia, diarrhea, and mesenteric artery thrombosis (0.03% each). Permanent VERZENIO treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was reported in 19% of patients receiving VERZENIO, plus tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. Of the patients receiving tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, 1% permanently discontinued due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO discontinuations were diarrhea (5%), fatigue (2%), and neutropenia (0.9%). Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 62% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. Adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO dose interruptions in \u22655% of patients were diarrhea (20%), neutropenia (16%), leukopenia (7%), and fatigue (5%). Dose reductions of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 44% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor). Adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO dose reductions in \u22655% were diarrhea (17%), neutropenia (8%), and fatigue (5%).

Median duration of treatment was 15.1 months for the VERZENIO arm and 13.9 months for the placebo arm. 14.2 )]. The most frequently reported (\u22655%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, increased ALT, and anemia. Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up, regardless of causality, were reported in 11 cases (3%) of VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor treated patients versus 3 cases (2%) of placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor treated patients. Causes of death for patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor included: 3 (0.9%) patient deaths due to underlying disease, 3 (0.9%) due to lung infection, 3 (0.9%) due to VTE, 1 (0.3%) due to pneumonitis, and 1 (0.3%) due to cerebral infarction. Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was reported in 13% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor and in 3% of patients receiving placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor were diarrhea (2%), ALT increased (2%), infection (1%), venous thromboembolic events (VTE) (1%), neutropenia (0.9%), renal impairment (0.9%), AST increased (0.6%), dyspnea (0.6%), pulmonary fibrosis (0.6%) and anemia, rash, weight decreased and thrombocytopenia (each 0.3%). Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 56% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus anastrozole or letrozole. Adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO dose interruptions in \u22655% of patients were neutropenia (16%) and diarrhea (15%). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus anastrozole or letrozole. Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions in \u22655% of patients were diarrhea and neutropenia. VERZENIO dose reductions due to diarrhea of any grade occurred in 13% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. VERZENIO dose reductions due to neutropenia of any grade occurred in 11% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to 0.6% of patients receiving placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor.

Alternative markers such as BUN, cystatin C, or calculated GFR, which are not based on creatinine, may be considered to determine whether renal function is impaired. 12.3 )] MONARCH 2: VERZENIO in Combination with Fulvestrant Women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression on or after prior adjuvant or metastatic endocrine therapy The safety of VERZENIO (150\u00a0mg twice daily) plus fulvestrant (500\u00a0mg) versus placebo plus fulvestrant was evaluated in MONARCH 2 [see Clinical Studies ( . The data described below reflect exposure to VERZENIO in 441 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least one dose of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2. 14.2 )] Median duration of treatment was 12 months for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant and 8 months for patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. The most frequently reported (\u22655%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, anemia, and infections. Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up, regardless of causality, were reported in 18 cases (4%) of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant treated patients versus 10 cases (5%) of placebo plus fulvestrant treated patients. Causes of death for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant included: 7 (2%) patient deaths due to underlying disease, 4 (0.9%) due to sepsis, 2 (0.5%) due to pneumonitis, 2 (0.5%) due to hepatotoxicity, and one (0.2%) due to cerebral infarction. Permanent study treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction were reported in 9% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant and in 3% of patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant were infection (2%), diarrhea (1%), hepatotoxicity (1%), fatigue (0.7%), nausea (0.2%), abdominal pain (0.2%), acute kidney injury (0.2%), and cerebral infarction (0.2%). Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 52% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO dose interruptions in \u22655% of patients were diarrhea (19%) and neutropenia (16%). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to reductions in \u22655% of patients were diarrhea and neutropenia. VERZENIO dose reductions due to diarrhea of any grade occurred in 19% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant compared to 0.4% of patients receiving placebo and fulvestrant. VERZENIO dose reductions due to neutropenia of any grade occurred in 10% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant compared to no patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. The most common adverse reactions reported (\u226520%) in the VERZENIO arm were: diarrhea, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, infections, abdominal pain, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, and headache. Adverse reactions are shown in Table 12 and laboratory abnormalities in Table 13 .

Patients received 200\u00a0mg VERZENIO orally twice daily until development of progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity. Median duration of treatment was 4.5 months. 14.2 )] The most frequently reported (\u22655%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, and leukopenia. Deaths due to adverse reactions during treatment or during the 30-day follow up were reported in 2% of patients. Cause of death in these patients was due to infection (2 patients) or pneumonitis (1 patient). Ten patients (8%) discontinued study treatment from adverse reactions due to (1 patient each), abdominal pain, arterial thrombosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, blood creatinine increased, chronic kidney disease, diarrhea, ECG QT prolonged, fatigue, hip fracture, and lymphopenia. Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 58% of patients. The most frequent (\u22655%) adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions were diarrhea (24%), neutropenia (16%), fatigue (10%), vomiting (6%), and nausea (5%). Forty-nine percent of patients had dose reductions due to an adverse reaction. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were diarrhea (20%), neutropenia (11%), and fatigue (9%). The most common reported adverse reactions (\u226520%) were: diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, neutropenia, vomiting, infections, anemia, headache, and thrombocytopenia.
