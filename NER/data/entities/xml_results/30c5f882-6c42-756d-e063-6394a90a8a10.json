    "indications_original": "1\u00a0\u00a0INDICATIONS AND USAGE Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ( 1.1 ) 1.1\u00a0\u00a0Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Atomoxetine capsules are indicated for the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The efficacy of atomoxetine capsules was established in seven clinical trials in outpatients with ADHD: four 6 to 9-week trials in pediatric patients (ages 6 to 18), two 10-week trial in adults, and one maintenance trial in pediatrics (ages 6 to 15) [see Clinical Studies ( . 14 )] 1.2\u00a0\u00a0Diagnostic Considerations A diagnosis of ADHD (DSM-IV) implies the presence of hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that cause impairment and that were present before age 7 years. The symptoms must be persistent, must be more severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development, must cause clinically significant impairment, e.g., in social, academic, or occupational functioning, and must be present in 2 or more settings, e.g., school (or work) and at home. The symptoms must not be better accounted for by another mental disorder. The specific etiology of ADHD is unknown, and there is no single diagnostic test. Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but also of special psychological, educational, and social resources. Learning may or may not be impaired. The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the patient and not solely on the presence of the required number of DSM-IV characteristics. For the Inattentive Type, at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months: lack of attention to details/careless mistakes, lack of sustained attention, poor listener, failure to follow through on tasks, poor organization, avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort, loses things, easily distracted, forgetful. For the Hyperactive-Impulsive Type, at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months: fidgeting/squirming, leaving seat, inappropriate running/climbing, difficulty with quiet activities, \u201con the go,\u201d excessive talking, blurting answers, can\u2019t wait turn, intrusive. For a Combined Type diagnosis, both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive criteria must be met. 1.3\u00a0\u00a0Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program Atomoxetine is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that may include other measures (psychological, educational, social) for patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment may not be indicated for all patients with this syndrome. Drug treatment is not intended for use in the patient who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and/or other primary psychiatric disorders, including psychosis. Appropriate educational placement is essential in children and adolescents with this diagnosis and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. When remedial measures alone are insufficient, the decision to prescribe drug treatment medication will depend upon the physician\u2019s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient\u2019s symptoms.",
    "contraindications_original": "4\u00a0\u00a0CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to atomoxetine or other constituents of product. ( 4.1 ) Atomoxetine use within 2 weeks after discontinuing MAOI or other drugs that affect brain monoamine concentrations. ( 4.2 , 7.1 ) Narrow Angle Glaucoma. ( 4.3 ) Pheochromocytoma or history of pheochromocytoma. ( 4.4 ) Severe Cardiovascular Disorders that might deteriorate with clinically important increases in HR and BP. ( 4.5 ) 4.1\u00a0\u00a0Hypersensitivity Atomoxetine capsules are contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to atomoxetine or other constituents of the product [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.8 )] 4.2\u00a0\u00a0Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) Atomoxetine should not be taken with an MAOI, or within 2 weeks after discontinuing an MAOI. Treatment with an MAOI should not be initiated within 2 weeks after discontinuing atomoxetine. With other drugs that affect brain monoamine concentrations, there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) when taken in combination with an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Such reactions may occur when these drugs are given concurrently or in close proximity [see Drug Interactions ( . 7.1 )] 4.3\u00a0\u00a0Narrow Angle Glaucoma In clinical trials, atomoxetine use was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis and therefore its use is not recommended in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. 4.4 Pheochromocytoma Serious reactions, including elevated blood pressure and tachyarrhythmia, have been reported in patients with pheochromocytoma or a history of pheochromocytoma who received atomoxetine. Therefore, atomoxetine should not be taken by patients with pheochromocytoma or a history of pheochromocytoma. 4.5 Severe Cardiovascular Disorders Atomoxetine should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experience increases in blood pressure or heart rate that could be clinically important (for example, 15 to 20 mm Hg in blood pressure or 20 beats per minute in heart rate) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )].",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5\u00a0\u00a0WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Suicidal Ideation - Monitor for suicidality, clinical worsening, and unusual changes in behavior. (5.1) Severe Liver Injury- Should be discontinued and not restarted in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury. (5.2) Serious Cardiovascular Events - Sudden death, stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in association with atomoxetine treatment. Patients should have a careful history and physical exam to assess for presence of cardiovascular disease. Atomoxetine generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to its noradrenergic effects. Consideration should be given to not using atomoxetine in adults with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities. ( 5.3 ) Emergent Cardiovascular Symptoms - Patients should undergo prompt cardiac evaluation. (5.3) Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate - Increase in blood pressure and heart rate; orthostasis and syncope may occur. Use with caution in patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. (5.4) Psychotic or Manic Symptoms - Consider discontinuing atomoxetine capsules if such new symptoms occur. (5.5) Bipolar Disorder - Screen patients for bipolar disorder. (5.6) Aggressive behavior or hostility \u2013 Monitor for the appearance or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility. (5.7) Possible allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, and rash. (5.8) Effects on Urine Outflow - Urinary hesitancy and retention may occur. (5.9) Priapism - Prompt medical attention is required in the event of suspected priapism. (5.10, 17 ) Growth - Height and weight should be monitored in pediatric patients. (5.11) Concomitant Use of Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors or Use in patients known to be CYP2D6 PMs - Dose adjustment of Atomoxetine Hydrochloride Capsules may be necessary. ( 5.13 ) 5.1\u00a0\u00a0Suicidal Ideation Atomoxetine increased the risk of suicidal ideation in short-term studies in children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Pooled analyses of short-term (6 to 18 weeks) placebo-controlled trials of atomoxetine in children and adolescents have revealed a greater risk of suicidal ideation early during treatment in those receiving atomoxetine. There were a total of 12 trials (11 in ADHD and 1 in enuresis) involving over 2200 patients (including 1357 patients receiving atomoxetine and 851 receiving placebo). The average risk of suicidal ideation in patients receiving atomoxetine was 0.4% (5/1357 patients), compared to none in placebo-treated patients. There was 1 suicide attempt among these approximately 2200 patients, occurring in a patient treated with atomoxetine. No suicides occurred in these trials. All reactions occurred in children 12 years of age or younger. All reactions occurred during the first month of treatment. It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal ideation in pediatric patients extends to longer-term use. A similar analysis in adult patients treated with atomoxetine for either ADHD or major depressive disorder (MDD) did not reveal an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior in association with the use of atomoxetine. All pediatric patients being treated with atomoxetine should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms have been reported with atomoxetine: anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania and mania. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is a concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Thus, patients being treated with atomoxetine should be observed for the emergence of such symptoms. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to emerging suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe or abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient\u2019s presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of pediatric patients being treated with atomoxetine should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. 5.2\u00a0\u00a0Severe Liver Injury Postmarketing reports indicate that atomoxetine can cause severe liver injury. Although no evidence of liver injury was detected in clinical trials of about 6000 patients, there have been rare cases of clinically significant liver injury that were considered probably or possibly related to atomoxetine use in postmarketing experience. Rare cases of liver failure have also been reported, including a case that resulted in a liver transplant. Because of probable underreporting, it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the true incidence of these reactions. Reported cases of liver injury occurred within 120 days of initiation of atomoxetine in the majority of cases and some patients presented with markedly elevated liver enzymes [>20 X upper limit of normal (ULN)], and jaundice with significantly elevated bilirubin levels (>2 X ULN), followed by recovery upon atomoxetine discontinuation. In one patient, liver injury, manifested by elevated hepatic enzymes up to 40 X ULN and jaundice with bilirubin up to 12 X ULN, recurred upon rechallenge, and was followed by recovery upon drug discontinuation, providing evidence that atomoxetine likely caused the liver injury. Such reactions may occur several months after therapy is started, but laboratory abnormalities may continue to worsen for several weeks after drug is stopped. The patient described above recovered from his liver injury, and did not require a liver transplant. Atomoxetine should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted. Laboratory testing to determine liver enzyme levels should be done upon the first symptom or sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark urine, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained \u201cflu like\u201d symptoms) [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.12 ); Patient Counseling Information (17)] 5.3\u00a0\u00a0Serious Cardiovascular Events Sudden Death and Pre-existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems Children and Adolescents \u2014 Sudden death has been reported in association with atomoxetine treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, atomoxetine generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the noradrenergic effects of atomoxetine. Adults \u2014 Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking atomoxetine at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of atomoxetine in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Consideration should be given to not treating adults with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities. Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Atomoxetine Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with atomoxetine should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during atomoxetine treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation. 5.4\u00a0\u00a0Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Atomoxetine should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate [see Contraindications (4.5)] . Pulse and blood pressure should be measured at baseline, following atomoxetine dose increases, and periodically while on therapy to detect possible clinically important increases. The following table provides short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trial data for the proportions of patients having an increase in: diastolic blood pressure \u226515 mm Hg; systolic blood pressure \u226520 mm Hg; heart rate greater than or equal to 20 bpm, in both the pediatric and adult populations ( see Table 1). Table 1 a Pediatric Acute Adult Acute Placebo-Controlled Placebo-Controlled Maximum b Endpoint Maximum b Endpoint Atomoxetine Placebo Atomoxetine Placebo Atomoxetine Placebo Atomoxetine Placebo % % % % % % % % DBP (\u2265 15mm Hg) 21.5 14.1 9.3 4.8 12.6 8.7 4.8 3.5 SBP (\u2265 20mm Hg) 12.5 8.7 4.9 3.3 12.4 7.8 4.2 3.2 HR (\u2265 20 bpm) 23.4 11.5 12.2 3.8 22.4 8.3 10.2 2.0 a Abbreviations: bpm=beats per minute; DBP=diastolic blood pressure; HR=heart rate; mm Hg=millimeters mercury; SBP=systolic blood pressure. b Proportion of patients meeting threshold at any one time during clinical trial. In placebo-controlled registration studies involving pediatric patients, tachycardia was identified as an adverse event for 0.3% (5/1597) of these atomoxetine patients compared with 0% (0/934) of placebo patients. The mean heart rate increase in extensive metabolizer (EM) patients was 5.0 beats/minute, and in poor metabolizer (PM) patients 9.4 beats/minute. In adult clinical trials where EM/PM status was available, the mean heart rate increase in PM patients was significantly higher than in EM patients (11 beats/minute versus 7.5 beats/minute). The heart rate effects could be clinically important in some PM patients. In placebo-controlled registration studies involving adult patients, tachycardia was identified as an adverse event for 1.5% (8/540) of atomoxetine patients compared with 0.5% (2/402) of placebo patients. In adult clinical trials where EM/PM status was available, the mean change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure in PM patients was higher than in EM patients (4.21 versus 2.13 mm Hg) as was the mean change from baseline in systolic blood pressure (PM: 2.75 versus EM: 2.40 mm Hg). The blood pressure effects could be clinically important in some PM patients. Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported in patients taking atomoxetine. In child and adolescent registration studies, 0.2% (12/5596) of atomoxetine-treated patients experienced orthostatic hypotension and 0.8% (46/5596) experienced syncope. In short-term child and adolescent registration studies, 1.8% (6/340) of atomoxetine-treated patients experienced orthostatic hypotension compared with 0.5% (1/207) of placebo-treated patients. Syncope was not reported during short-term child and adolescent placebo-controlled ADHD registration studies. Atomoxetine should be used with caution in any condition that may predispose patients to hypotension, or conditions associated with abrupt heart rate or blood pressure changes. 5.5\u00a0\u00a0Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms Psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by atomoxetine at usual doses. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing atomoxetine. 5.6\u00a0\u00a0Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder Patients with bipolar disorder or risk factors for bipolar disorder may be at increased risk of developing mania or mixed episodes during treatment with atomoxetine. It may not be possible to determine whether a manic or mixed episode that appears during treatment with atomoxetine is due to an adverse reaction to atomoxetine or a patient\u2019s underlying bipolar disorder. Before initiating treatment with atomoxetine, patients should be adequately screened for risk factors for bipolar disorder such as a personal or family history of mania and depression. 5.7\u00a0\u00a0Aggressive Behavior or Hostility Patients beginning treatment with atomoxetine should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility. There is evidence that atomoxetine may cause the emergence or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility. ADHD and other mental illnesses can be associated with irritability, which can make it difficult to determine if the drug or the underlying psychiatric condition is causing the emergence or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility in specific patients. If such symptoms occur during treatment, consider a possible causal role of atomoxetine. 5.8\u00a0\u00a0Allergic Events Although uncommon, allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, and rash, have been reported in patients taking atomoxetine. 5.9\u00a0\u00a0Effects on Urine Outflow from the Bladder In adult ADHD controlled trials, the rates of urinary retention (1.7%, 9/540) and urinary hesitation (5.6%, 30/540) were increased among atomoxetine subjects compared with placebo subjects (0%, 0/402; 0.5%, 2/402, respectively). Two adult atomoxetine subjects and no placebo subjects discontinued from controlled clinical trials because of urinary retention. A complaint of urinary retention or urinary hesitancy should be considered potentially related to atomoxetine. 5.10\u00a0\u00a0Priapism Rare postmarketing cases of priapism, defined as painful and nonpainful penile erection lasting more than 4 hours, have been reported for pediatric and adult patients treated with atomoxetine. The erections resolved in cases in which follow-up information was available, some following discontinuation of atomoxetine. Prompt medical attention is required in the event of suspected priapism. 5.11  Effects on Growth Data on the long-term effects of atomoxetine on growth come from open-label studies, and weight and height changes are compared to normative population data. In general, the weight and height gain of pediatric patients treated with atomoxetine lags behind that predicted by normative population data for about the first 9 to 12 months of treatment. Subsequently, weight gain rebounds and at about 3 years of treatment, patients treated with atomoxetine have gained 17.9 kg on average, 0.5 kg more than predicted by their baseline data. After about 12 months, gain in height stabilizes, and at 3 years, patients treated with atomoxetine have gained 19.4 cm on average, 0.4 cm less than predicted by their baseline data. Figure 1: Mean Weight and Height Percentiles Over Time for Patients with Three Years of Atomoxetine Treatment This growth pattern was generally similar regardless of pubertal status at the time of treatment initiation. Patients who were pre-pubertal at the start of treatment (girls \u22648 years old, boys \u22649 years old) gained an average of 2.1 kg and 1.2 cm less than predicted after three years. Patients who were pubertal (girls >8 to \u226413 years old, boys >9 to \u226414 years old) or late pubertal (girls >13 years old, boys >14 years old) had average weight and height gains that were close to or exceeded those predicted after three years of treatment. Growth followed a similar pattern in both extensive and poor metabolizers (EMs, PMs). PMs treated for at least two years gained an average of 2.4 kg and 1.1 cm less than predicted, while EMs gained an average of 0.2 kg and 0.4 cm less than predicted. In short-term controlled studies (up to 9 weeks), atomoxetine-treated patients lost an average of 0.4 kg and gained an average of 0.9 cm, compared to a gain of 1.5 kg and 1.1 cm in the placebo-treated patients. In a fixed-dose controlled trial, 1.3%, 7.1%, 19.3%, and 29.1% of patients lost at least 3.5% of their body weight in the placebo, 0.5, 1.2, and 1.8 mg/kg/day dose groups. Growth should be monitored during treatment with atomoxetine. 5.12\u00a0\u00a0Laboratory Tests Routine laboratory tests are not required. CYP2D6 metabolism \u2014 Poor metabolizers (PMs) of CYP2D6 have a 10-fold higher AUC and a 5-fold higher peak concentration to a given dose of atomoxetine compared with extensive metabolizers (EMs). Approximately 7% of a Caucasian population are PMs. Laboratory tests are available to identify CYP2D6 PMs. The blood levels in PMs are similar to those attained by taking strong inhibitors of CYP2D6. The higher blood levels in PMs lead to a higher rate of some adverse effects of atomoxetine [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.13\u00a0\u00a0Concomitant Use of Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors or Use in Patients who are known to be CYP2D6 PMs Atomoxetine is primarily metabolized by the CYP2D6 pathway to 4-hydroxyatomoxetine. Dosage adjustment of atomoxetine may be necessary when coadministered with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and quinidine) or when administered to CYP2D6 PMs [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Drug Interactions (7.2)].",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6\u00a0\u00a0ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and at least twice the incidence of placebo patients) Child and Adolescent Clinical Trials - Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and somnolence. (6.1) Adult Clinical Trials - Constipation, dry mouth, nausea, decreased appetite, dizziness, erectile dysfunction, and urinary hesitation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\u00a0\u00a0Clinical Trials Experience Atomoxetine was administered to 5382 children or adolescent patients with ADHD and 1007 adults with ADHD in clinical studies. During the ADHD clinical trials, 1625 children and adolescent patients were treated for longer than 1 year and 2529 children and adolescent patients were treated for over 6 months. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Child and Adolescent Clinical Trials Reasons for discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions in child and adolescent clinical trials \u2014 In acute child and adolescent placebo-controlled trials, 3.0% (48/1613) of atomoxetine subjects and 1.4% (13/945) placebo subjects discontinued for adverse reactions. For all studies, (including open-label and long-term studies), 6.3% of extensive metabolizer (EM) patients and 11.2% of poor metabolizer (PM) patients discontinued because of an adverse reaction. Among atomoxetine-treated patients, irritability (0.3%, N=5); somnolence (0.3%, N=5); aggression (0.2%, N=4); nausea (0.2%, N=4); vomiting (0.2%, N=4); abdominal pain (0.2%, N=4); constipation (0.1%, N=2); fatigue (0.1%, N=2); feeling abnormal (0.1%, N=2); and headache (0.1%, N=2) were the reasons for discontinuation reported by more than 1 patient. Seizures \u2014 Atomoxetine has not been systematically evaluated in pediatric patients with seizure disorder as these patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product\u2019s premarket testing. In the clinical development program, seizures were reported in 0.2% (12/5073) of children whose average age was 10 years (range 6 to 16 years). In these clinical trials, the seizure risk among poor metabolizers was 0.3% (1/293) compared to 0.2% (11/4741) for extensive metabolizers. Commonly observed adverse reactions in acute child and adolescent, placebo-controlled trials \u2014 Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of atomoxetine (incidence of 2% or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients (atomoxetine incidence greater than placebo) are listed in Table 2. Results were similar in the BID and the QD trial except as shown in Table 3, which shows both BID and QD results for selected adverse reactions based on statistically significant Breslow-Day tests. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with atomoxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients, for either BID or QD dosing) were: nausea, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and somnolence ( see Tables 2 and 3). Additional data from ADHD clinical trials (controlled and uncontrolled) has shown that approximately 5 to 10% of pediatric patients experienced potentially clinically important changes in heart rate (\u226520 beats per min) or blood pressure (\u226515 to 20 mm Hg) [see Contraindications ( . 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] Table 2: Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Atomoxetine in Acute (up to 18 weeks) Child and Adolescent Trials Adverse Reaction a Percentage of Patients Reporting Reaction Atomoxetine (N=1597) Placebo (N=934) Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain b 18 10 Vomiting 11 6 Nausea 10 5 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 8 3 Irritability 6 3 Therapeutic response unexpected 2 1 Investigations Weight decreased 3 0 Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders Decreased appetite 16 4 Anorexia 3 1 Nervous System Disorders Headache 19 15 Somnolence c 11 4 Dizziness 5 2 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash 2 1 a Reactions reported by at least 2% of patients treated with atomoxetine, and greater than placebo. The following reactions did not meet this criterion but were reported by more atomoxetine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients and are possibly related to atomoxetine treatment: blood pressure increased, early morning awakening (terminal insomnia), flushing, mydriasis, sinus tachycardia, asthenia, palpitations, mood swings, constipation, and dyspepsia. The following reactions were reported by at least 2% of patients treated with atomoxetine, and equal to or less than placebo: pharyngolaryngeal pain, insomnia (insomnia includes the terms, insomnia, initial insomnia, middle insomnia). The following reaction did not meet this criterion but shows a statistically significant dose relationship: pruritus. b Abdominal pain includes the terms: abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, abdominal discomfort, epigastric discomfort. c Somnolence includes the terms: sedation, somnolence.

The following adverse reactions occurred in at least 2% of child and adolescent CYP2D6 PM patients and were statistically significantly more frequent in PM patients compared with CYP2D6 EM patients: insomnia (11% of PMs, 6% of EMs); weight decreased (7% of PMs, 4% of EMs); constipation (7% of PMs, 4% of EMs); depression 1 (7% of PMs, 4% of EMs); tremor (5% of PMs, 1% of EMs); excoriation (4% of PMs, 2% of EMs); middle insomnia (3% of PMs, 1% of EMs); conjunctivitis (3% of PMs, 1% of EMs); syncope (3% of PMs, 1% of EMs); early morning awakening (2% of PMs, 1% of EMs); mydriasis (2% of PMs, 1% of EMs); sedation (4% of PMs, 2% of EMs). 1 Depression includes the following terms: depression, major depression, depressive symptoms, depressed mood, dysphoria. Adult Clinical Trials Reasons for discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions in acute adult placebo-controlled trials -In the acute adult placebo-controlled trials, 11.3% (61/541) atomoxetine subjects and 3.0% (12/405) placebo subjects discontinued for adverse reactions. Among atomoxetine-treated patients, insomnia (0.9%, N=5); nausea (0.9%, N=5); chest pain (0.6%, N=3); fatigue (0.6%, N=3); anxiety (0.4%, N=2); erectile dysfunction (0.4%, N=2); mood swings (0.4%, N=2); nervousness (0.4%, N=2); palpitations (0.4%, N=2); and urinary retention (0.4%, N=2) were the reasons for discontinuation reported by more than 1 patient. Seizures \u2014 Atomoxetine has not been systematically evaluated in adult patients with a seizure disorder as these patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product\u2019s premarket testing. In the clinical development program, seizures were reported on 0.1% (1/748) of adult patients. In these clinical trials, no poor metabolizers (0/43) reported seizures compared to 0.1% (1/705) for extensive metabolizers. Commonly observed adverse reactions in acute adult placebo-controlled trials \u2014 Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of atomoxetine (incidence of 2% or greater) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients (atomoxetine incidence greater than placebo) are listed in Table 4. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with atomoxetine (incidence of 5% or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients) were: constipation, dry mouth, nausea, decreased appetite, dizziness, erectile dysfunction, and urinary hesitation ( see Table 4). Additional data from ADHD clinical trials (controlled and uncontrolled) has shown that approximately 5 to 10% of adult patients experienced potentially clinically important changes in heart rate (\u226520 beats per min) or blood pressure (\u226515 to 20 mm Hg) [see Contraindications ( . 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )] Table 4: Common Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Associated with the Use of Atomoxetine in Acute (up to 25 weeks) Adult Trials Adverse Reaction a Percentage of Patients Reporting Reaction Atomoxetine (N=1697) Placebo (N=1560) Cardiac Disorders Palpitations 3 1 Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry mouth 20 5 Nausea 26 6 Constipation 8 3 Abdominal pain b 7 4 Dyspepsia 4 2 Vomiting 4 2 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 10 6 Chills 3 0 Feeling jittery 2 1 Irritability 5 3 Thirst 2 1 Investigations Weight decreased 2 1 Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders Decreased appetite 16 3 Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 8 3 Somnolence c 8 5 Paraesthesia 3 0 Psychiatric Disorders Abnormal dreams 4 3 Insomnia d 15 8 Libido decreased 3 1 Sleep disorder 3 1 Renal and Urinary Disorders Urinary hesitation e 6 1 Dysuria 2 0 Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Erectile dysfunction f 8 1 Dysmenorrhea g 3 2 Ejaculation delayed f and/or ejaculation disorder f 4 1 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hyperhidrosis 4 1 Vascular Disorders Hot flush 3 0 a Reactions reported by at least 2% of patients treated with atomoxetine, and greater than placebo. The following reactions did not meet this criterion but were reported by more atomoxetine-treated patients than placebo-treated patients and are possibly related to atomoxetine treatment: peripheral coldness, tachycardia, prostatitis, testicular pain, orgasm abnormal, flatulence, asthenia, feeling cold, muscle spasm, dysgeusia, agitation, restlessness, micturition urgency, pollakiuria, pruritus, urticaria, flushing, tremor, menstruation irregular, rash, and urinary retention. The following reactions were reported by at least 2% of patients treated with atomoxetine, and equal to or less than placebo: anxiety, diarrhea, back pain, headache, and oropharyngeal pain. b Abdominal pain includes the terms: abdominal pain upper, abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, abdominal discomfort, epigastric discomfort. c Somnolence includes the terms: sedation, somnolence. d Insomnia includes the terms: insomnia, initial insomnia, middle insomnia, and terminal insomnia. e Urinary hesitation includes the terms: urinary hesitation, urine flow decreased. f Based on total number of males (Atomoxetine, N=943; placebo, N=869). g Based on total number of females (Atomoxetine, N=754; placebo, N=691). The following adverse events occurred in at least 2% of adult CYP2D6 poor metaboliser (PM) patients and were statistically significantly more frequent in PM patients compared to CYP2D6 extensive metaboliser (EM) patients: vision blurred (4% of PMs, 1% of EMs); dry mouth (35% of PMs, 17% of EMs); constipation (11% of PMs, 7% of EMs); feeling jittery (5% of PMs, 2% of EMs); decreased appetite (23% of PMs, 15% of EMs); tremor (5% of PMs, 1% of EMs); insomnia (19% of PMs, 11% of EMs); sleep disorder (7% of PMs, 3% of EMs); middle insomnia (5% of PMs, 3% of EMs); terminal insomnia (3% of PMs, 1% of EMs); urinary retention (6% of PMs, 1% of EMs); erectile dysfunction (21% of PMs, 9% of EMs); ejaculation disorder (6% of PMs, 2% of EMs); hyperhidrosis (15% of PMs, 7% of EMs); peripheral coldness (3% of PMs, 1% of EMs). Male and female sexual dysfunction \u2014 Atomoxetine appears to impair sexual function in some patients. Changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction are not well assessed in most clinical trials because they need special attention and because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate the actual incidence. Table 4 above displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2% of adult patients taking atomoxetine in placebo-controlled trials. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with atomoxetine treatment. While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of atomoxetine, physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects. 6.2\u00a0\u00a0Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of atomoxetine. Unless otherwise specified, these adverse reactions have occurred in adults and children and adolescents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular system \u2013 QT prolongation, syncope. Peripheral vascular effects \u2014 Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. General disorders and administration site conditions - Lethargy. Musculoskeletal system \u2014 Rhabdomyolysis. Nervous system disorders -Hypoaesthesia; paraesthesia in children and adolescents; sensory disturbances; tics. Psychiatric disorders \u2013 Depression and depressed mood; anxiety, libido changes. Seizures \u2014 Seizures have been reported in the postmarketing period. The postmarketing seizure cases include patients with pre-existing seizure disorders and those with identified risk factors for seizures, as well as patients with neither a history of nor identified risk factors for seizures. The exact relationship between atomoxetine and seizures is difficult to evaluate due to uncertainty about the background risk of seizures in ADHD patients. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \u2013 Alopecia, hyperhidrosis. Urogenital system \u2013 Male pelvic pain; urinary hesitation in children and adolescents; urinary retention in children and adolescents.",
