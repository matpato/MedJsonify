    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PR E CAUTIONS Marginal mandibular nerve (MMN) injury:\u00a0Follow injection technique to avoid this injury.\u00a0( 2.3 , 5.1 ) Dysphagia may occur with KYBELLA use. \u00a0Use in patients with pre-existing dysphagia may exacerbate the condition. ( 5.2 ) Submental hematoma/bruising\u00a0occurs frequently after KYBELLA administration.\u00a0\u00a0Use with caution\u00a0in patients who are being treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or have coagulation abnormalities. ( 5.3 ) Avoid injecting in proximity to vulnerable anatomic structures due to the increased risk of tissue damage and vascular injury.\u00a0( 2.3 , 5.4 ) Injection site alopecia: Withhold subsequent treatments until resolution. ( 5.5 ) Injection site ulceration, necrosis, and infection: Do not administer to the affected area until complete resolution. ( 5.6 ) 5 . 1 Marginal mandibular nerve injury Cases of marginal mandibular nerve injury, manifested as an asymmetric smile or facial muscle weakness (paresis), were reported during clinical trials. \u00a0To avoid the potential for nerve injury,\u00a0KYBELLA\u00a0injection should not be injected into or in close proximity to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.\u00a0All marginal mandibular nerve injuries reported from the trials resolved spontaneously (range 1-298 days, median 44 days). 5 . 2 Dysphagia Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) occurred in clinical trials in the setting of administration site reactions, e.g., pain, swelling, and induration of the submental area. \u00a0Cases of dysphagia spontaneously resolved (range\u00a01-81 days, median 3 days). Subjects\u00a0with current or prior history of dysphagia were excluded from clinical trials.  Avoid use of KYBELLA in these patients as current or prior history of dysphagia may exacerbate the condition. 5.3 Injection site hematoma /bruising In clinical trials, 72% of subjects treated with KYBELLA experienced injection site hematoma/bruising [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ] . KYBELLA should be used with caution in patients with bleeding abnormalities or who are\u00a0currently being treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy\u00a0as excessive bleeding or bruising in the treatment area may occur. 5.4 Risk of injecting in proximity to vulnerable anatomic structure s To avoid potential tissue damage, KYBELLA should not be injected into or in close proximity (1-1.5 cm) to salivary glands, lymph nodes and muscles. Care should be taken to avoid inadvertent injection directly into an artery or a vein as it can result in vascular injury. 5.5 Injection site alopecia Cases of injection site alopecia have been reported with the administration of KYBELLA. The onset and duration of this adverse reaction may vary among individuals and may persist. Consider withholding subsequent treatments until resolution of the adverse reaction. 5.6 Injection site ulceration , necrosis , and infection Injections that are too superficial (into the dermis) may result in skin ulceration and necrosis [see Injection Technique ( 2.3 )] . Cases of injection site ulceration, necrosis, and infection have been reported with the administration of KYBELLA. Some cases of injection site infection have included cellulitis and abscess requiring intravenous antibiotic treatment and incision and drainage. Do not administer KYBELLA into the affected area until complete resolution of the adverse reaction.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (>20% of subjects) include injection site edema/swelling, hematoma, pain, numbness, erythema and induration. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Allergan at 1-800-678-1605  or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted\u00a0under\u00a0widely varying conditions, the\u00a0adverse\u00a0reaction rates\u00a0observed in the clinical trials of a\u00a0drug cannot\u00a0be\u00a0directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another\u00a0drug and may not\u00a0reflect the rates observed in practice. In two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials 513 subjects were treated with KYBELLA\u00a0injection\u00a0and 506 subjects were treated with placebo. \u00a0The population was 19-65 years old, 85% were women, 87% Caucasian, 8% African American. \u00a0At baseline the population had a mean BMI of 29\u00a0kg/m 2 , moderate to severe submental convexity (graded as 2 or 3 on a 0 to 4 scale) and without excessive\u00a0skin laxity.\u00a0\u00a0Subjects received up to 6 treatments at least 1 month apart and were followed for up to 6 months after the last received treatment.

Adverse reactions that lasted more than 30 days and occurred in more than 10% of subjects were injection site numbness (42%), injection site edema/swelling (20%), injection site pain (16%), and injection site induration (13%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of KYBELLA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to KYBELLA exposure. Administration site conditions : injection site ulceration, necrosis,\u00a0infection, alopecia, scarring, and mass. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, and itching. Nervous System Disorders: Oral hypoaesthesia and oral paraesthesia. Procedural Complications: Vascular injury due to inadvertent intravascular injection.",
