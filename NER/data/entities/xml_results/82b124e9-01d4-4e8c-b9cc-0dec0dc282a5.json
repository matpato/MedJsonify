( 1.3 ) \u2022 Daptomycin for Injection is not indicated for the treatment of pneumonia. ( 1.3 ) \u2022 Daptomycin for Injection is not indicated for the treatment of left-sided infective endocarditis due to S. aureus . ( 1.3 ) \u2022 Daptomycin for Injection is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than one year of age due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs. ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Daptomycin for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Daptomycin for Injection should be used to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.4 ) 1.1\tComplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections (cSSSI) Daptomycin for Injection is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of the following Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and Enterococcus faecalis (vancomycin-susceptible isolates only). 1.2 Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infections (Bacteremia) in Adult Patients, Including Those with Right-Sided Infective Endocarditis, Caused by Methicillin-Susceptible and Methicillin-Resistant Isolates Daptomycin for Injection is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia), including adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates. 1.3\tLimitations of Use This Daptomycin for Injection product is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Daptomycin for Injection is not indicated for the treatment of pneumonia. Daptomycin for Injection is not indicated for the treatment of left-sided infective endocarditis due to S. aureus . The clinical trial of daptomycin for injection in adult patients with S. aureus bloodstream infections included limited data from patients with left-sided infective endocarditis; outcomes in these patients were poor [see . Daptomycin for Injection has not been studied in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Clinical Studies (14.2) ] Daptomycin for Injection is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than 1 year of age due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs [see . Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ] 1.4\tUsage Appropriate specimens for microbiological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative pathogens and to determine their susceptibility to daptomycin. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Daptomycin for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Daptomycin for Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information is available, it should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Empiric therapy may be initiated while awaiting test results.",

( 5.1 ) \u2022 Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis: Monitor CPK levels and follow muscle pain or weakness; if elevated CPK or myopathy occurs, consider discontinuation of Daptomycin for Injection. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Eosinophilic pneumonia: Discontinue Daptomycin for Injection and consider treatment with systemic steroids. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS): Discontinue Daptomycin for Injection and institute appropriate treatment. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (TIN): Discontinue Daptomycin for Injection and institute appropriate treatment. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Peripheral neuropathy: Monitor for neuropathy and consider discontinuation. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Potential nervous system and/or muscular system effects in pediatric patients younger than 12 months: Avoid use of Daptomycin for Injection in this age group. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Clostridioides difficile\u2013 associated diarrhea: Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Persisting or relapsing S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis: Perform susceptibility testing and rule out sequestered foci of infection. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Decreased efficacy was observed in adult patients with moderate baseline renal impairment. ( 5.10 ) 5.1\tAnaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of antibacterial agents, including daptomycin for injection, and may be life-threatening. If an allergic reaction to Daptomycin for Injection occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate therapy [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.2\tMyopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Myopathy, defined as muscle aching or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), has been reported with the use of daptomycin for injection. Rhabdomyolysis, with or without acute renal failure, has been reported [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] Patients receiving Daptomycin for Injection should be monitored for the development of muscle pain or weakness, particularly of the distal extremities. In patients who receive Daptomycin for Injection, CPK levels should be monitored weekly, and more frequently in patients who received recent prior or concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or in whom elevations in CPK occur during treatment with Daptomycin for Injection. In adult patients with renal impairment, both renal function and CPK should be monitored more frequently than once weekly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. In Phase 1 studies and Phase 2 clinical trials in adults, CPK elevations appeared to be more frequent when daptomycin for injection was dosed more than once daily. Therefore, Daptomycin for Injection should not be dosed more frequently than once a day. Daptomycin for Injection should be discontinued in patients with unexplained signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with CPK elevations to levels >1,000 U/L (~5\u00d7 ULN), and in patients without reported symptoms who have marked elevations in CPK, with levels >2,000 U/L (\u226510\u00d7 ULN). In addition, consideration should be given to suspending agents associated with rhabdomyolysis, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, temporarily in patients receiving Daptomycin for Injection [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 5.3\tEosinophilic Pneumonia Eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported in patients receiving daptomycin for injection [see . In reported cases associated with daptomycin for injection, patients developed fever, dyspnea with hypoxic respiratory insufficiency, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates or organizing pneumonia. In general, patients developed eosinophilic pneumonia 2 to 4 weeks after starting daptomycin for injection, and improved when daptomycin for injection was discontinued and steroid therapy was initiated. Recurrence of eosinophilic pneumonia upon re-exposure has been reported. Patients who develop these signs and symptoms while receiving Daptomycin for Injection should undergo prompt medical evaluation, and Daptomycin for Injection should be discontinued immediately. Treatment with systemic steroids is recommended. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.4\tDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) DRESS has been reported in post-marketing experience with daptomycin for injection [see . Patients who develop skin rash, fever, peripheral eosinophilia, and systemic organ (for example, hepatic, renal, pulmonary) impairment while receiving Daptomycin for Injection should undergo medical evaluation. If DRESS is suspected, discontinue Daptomycin for Injection promptly and institute appropriate treatment. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.5\tTubulointerstitial Nephritis (TIN) TIN has been reported in post-marketing experience with daptomycin for injection [see . Patients who develop new or worsening renal impairment while receiving Daptomycin for Injection should undergo medical evaluation. If TIN is suspected, discontinue Daptomycin for Injection promptly and institute appropriate treatment. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.6\tPeripheral Neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported during the daptomycin for injection post-marketing experience [see Therefore, physicians should be alert to signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving Daptomycin for Injection. Monitor for neuropathy and consider discontinuation. Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.7\tPotential Nervous System and/or Muscular System Effects in Pediatric Patients Younger than 12 Months Avoid use of Daptomycin for Injection in pediatric patients younger than 12 months due to the risk of potential effects on muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems (either peripheral and/or central) observed in neonatal dogs with intravenous daptomycin [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2) ]. 5.8 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile \u2013associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with the use of nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including daptomycin for injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis [see Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, since these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.9\tPersisting or Relapsing S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis Patients with persisting or relapsing S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis or poor clinical response should have repeat blood cultures. If a blood culture is positive for S. aureus , minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility testing of the isolate should be performed using a standardized procedure, and diagnostic evaluation of the patient should be performed to rule out sequestered foci of infection. Appropriate surgical intervention (e.g., debridement, removal of prosthetic devices, valve replacement surgery) and/or consideration of a change in antibacterial regimen may be required. Failure of treatment due to persisting or relapsing S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis may be due to reduced daptomycin susceptibility (as evidenced by increasing MIC of the S. aureus isolate) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 5.10\tDecreased Efficacy in Patients with Moderate Baseline Renal Impairment Limited data are available from the two Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials regarding clinical efficacy of daptomycin for injection treatment in adult patients with creatinine clearance (CL CR ) <50 mL/min; only 31/534 (6%) patients treated with daptomycin for injection in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population had a baseline CL CR <50 mL/min. Table 2 shows the number of adult patients by renal function and treatment group who were clinical successes in the Phase 3 cSSSI trials. Table 2: Clinical Success Rates by Renal Function and Treatment Group in Phase 3 cSSSI Trials in Adult Patients (Population: ITT) CL CR Success Rate n/N (%) Daptomycin for Injection 4 mg/kg every 24h Comparator 50\u201370 mL/min 25/38 (66%) 30/48 (63%) 30\u2013<50 mL/min 7/15 (47%) 20/35 (57%) In a subgroup analysis of the ITT population in the Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, clinical success rates, as determined by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee [see , in the daptomycin for injection-treated adult patients were lower in patients with baseline CL Clinical Studies (14.2) ] CR <50 mL/min (see Table 3 ). A decrease of the magnitude shown in Table 3 was not observed in comparator-treated patients. Table 3: Adjudication Committee Clinical Success Rates at Test of Cure by Baseline Creatinine Clearance and Treatment Subgroup in the S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis Trial in Adult Patients (Population: ITT) Baseline CL CR Success Rate n/N (%) Daptomycin for Injection 6 mg/kg every 24h Comparator Bacteremia Right-Sided Infective Endocarditis Bacteremia Right-Sided Infective Endocarditis >80 mL/min 30/50 (60%) 7/14 (50%) 19/42 (45%) 5/11 (46%) 50\u201380 mL/min 12/26 (46%) 1/4 (25%) 13/31 (42%) 1/2 (50%) 30\u2013<50 mL/min 2/14 (14%) 0/1 (0%) 7/17 (41%) 1/1 (100%) Consider these data when selecting antibacterial therapy for use in adult patients with baseline moderate to severe renal impairment. 5.11\tIncreased International Normalized Ratio (INR)/Prolonged Prothrombin Time Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay [see . Drug Interactions (7.2) ] 5.12\tDevelopment of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Daptomycin for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.",

Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Patients Clinical trials enrolled 1,864 adult patients treated with daptomycin and 1,416 treated with comparator. Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trials in Adults In Phase 3 complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) trials in adult patients, daptomycin for injection was discontinued in 15/534 (2.8%) patients due to an adverse reaction, while comparator was discontinued in 17/558 (3.0%) patients. The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by body system, observed in adult patients with cSSSI (receiving 4 mg/kg daptomycin) are displayed in Table 4.

Serious Gram-negative infections (including bloodstream infections) were reported in 10/120 (8.3%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients and 0/115 comparator-treated patients. Comparator-treated patients received dual therapy that included initial gentamicin for 4 days. Infections were reported during treatment and during early and late follow-up. Gram-negative infections included cholangitis, alcoholic pancreatitis, sternal osteomyelitis/mediastinitis, bowel infarction, recurrent Crohn's disease, recurrent line sepsis, and recurrent urosepsis caused by a number of different Gram-negative bacteria. The rates of the most common adverse reactions, organized by System Organ Class (SOC), observed in adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis (receiving 6 mg/kg daptomycin) are displayed in Table 5.

These differences were due to lack of therapeutic effectiveness of daptomycin for injection in the treatment of CAP in patients experiencing these adverse events [see . Indications and Usage (1.3) ] Laboratory Changes in Adults Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infection Trials in Adults In Phase 3 cSSSI trials of adult patients receiving daptomycin for injection at a dose of 4 mg/kg, elevations in CPK were reported as clinical adverse events in 15/534 (2.8%) daptomycin for injection-treated patients, compared with 10/558 (1.8%) comparator-treated patients. Of the 534 patients treated with daptomycin, 1 (0.2%) had symptoms of muscle pain or weakness associated with CPK elevations to greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The symptoms resolved within 3 days and CPK returned to normal within 7 to 10 days after treatment was discontinued [see . Table 6 summarizes the CPK shifts from Baseline through End of Therapy in the cSSSI adult trials.

Of the 11 daptomycin for injection-treated patients, 4 had prior or concomitant treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Three of these 11 daptomycin for injection-treated patients discontinued therapy due to CPK elevation, while the one comparator-treated patient did not discontinue therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of daptomycin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: anemia, thrombocytopenia General and administration site conditions: pyrexia Immune System Disorders: anaphylaxis; hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, pruritus, hives, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, truncal erythema, and pulmonary eosinophilia [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Infections and Infestations: Clostridioides difficile \u2013associated diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Laboratory Investigations: platelet count decreased Musculoskeletal Disorders: myoglobin increased; rhabdomyolysis (some reports involved patients treated concurrently with daptomycin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: cough, eosinophilic pneumonia, organizing pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Nervous System Disorders: peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: serious skin reactions, including drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), vesiculobullous rash (with or without mucous membrane involvement, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome [SJS] and toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN]), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Gastrointestinal Disorders: nausea, vomiting Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: hyperkalemia Renal and urinary disorders: acute kidney injury, renal insufficiency, renal failure, and tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Special Senses: visual disturbances",
