    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction Dextroamphetamine sulfate has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of dextroamphetamine sulfate exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Dextroamphetamine sulfate can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution (see DRUG ABUSE and DEPENDENCE ). Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including dextroamphetamine sulfate, can result in overdose and death (see OVERDOSAGE ), and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection. Before prescribing dextroamphetamine sulfate, assess each patient\u2019s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store amphetamine sulfate in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give dextroamphetamine sulfate to anyone else. Throughout dextroamphetamine sulfate treatment, reassess each patient\u2019s risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who are treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosages. Avoid Dextroamphetamine Sulfate Oral Solution use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease. Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2 to 4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3 to 6 bpm). Monitor all patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension. Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Psychosis: CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder. Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder: CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients. Prior to initiating treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression). New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms: CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing dextroamphetamine sulfate. Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients: CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients, including dextroamphetamine sulfate. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in Dextroamphetamine Sulfate Oral Solution-treated pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants. Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted (see PRECAUTIONS , PEDIATRIC USE ). Seizures: There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of seizures, and, very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued. Peripheral Vasculopathy, Including Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon: Stimulants, including dextroamphetamine\u00a0sulfate oral solution, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulcerations and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports\u00a0and at the therapeutic\u00a0dosages of CNS stimulants in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally\u00a0improved after dosage reduction\u00a0or discontinuation of the CNS stimulant.\u00a0Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution-treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution-treated\u00a0patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy. Serotonin Syndrome : Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John\u2019s Wort (see DRUG INTERACTIONS ) . The coadministration with cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution. In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 (see DRUG INTERACTIONS ) . Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution with MAOI drugs is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) . Discontinue treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution\u00a0\u00a0with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome. Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome CNS stimulants, including amphetamine sulfate, have been associated with the onset or exacerbation of motor and verbal tics. Worsening of Tourette\u2019s syndrome has also been reported. Assess the family history and clinically evaluate patients for tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome before initiating dextroamphetamine sulfate. Regularly monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome with dextroamphetamine sulfate, and discontinue treatment if clinically appropriate.PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction Educate patients and their families about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction of dextroamphetamine sulfate which can lead to overdose and death, and proper disposal of any unused drug (see WARNINGS , DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE , and OVERDOSAGE ). Advise patients to store dextroamphetamine sulfate in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give dextroamphetamine sulfate to anyone else. Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease Advise patients that there are potential risks to patients with serious cardiac disease, including sudden death, with dextroamphetamine sulfate use. Instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if they develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease (see WARNINGS ). Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Advise patients that dextroamphetamine sulfate can elevate blood pressure and heart rate (see WARNINGS ). Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Advise patients that dextroamphetamine sulfate, at recommended doses, can cause psychotic or manic symptoms, even in patients without prior history of psychotic symptoms or mania (see WARNINGS ). Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients Advise patients that dextroamphetamine sulfate, may cause slowing of growth including weight loss (see WARNINGS ). Circulation problems in fingers and toes [Peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon] Instruct patients beginning treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution about the risk of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, and associated signs and symptoms: fingers or toes may feel numb, cool, painful, and/or may change color from pale, to blue, to red. Instruct patients to report to their physician any new numbness, pain, skin color change, or sensitivity to temperature in fingers or toes. Instruct patients to call their physician immediately with any signs of unexplained wounds appearing on fingers or toes while taking dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for certain patients. Serotonin Syndrome Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate and other serotonergic drugs including SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John's Wort, and\u00a0 with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others such as linezolid (see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome. Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome Advise patients that motor and verbal tics and worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome may occur during treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate. Instruct the patients to notify their healthcare provider if emergence or worsening of tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome occurs (see WARNINGS ). Amphetamines may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or vehicles; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly.",
