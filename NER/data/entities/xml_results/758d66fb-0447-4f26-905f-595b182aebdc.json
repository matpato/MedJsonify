RIVFLOZA is an LDHA -directed small interfering RNA indicated to lower urinary oxalate levels in children 2 years of age and older and adults with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and relatively preserved kidney function, e.g., eGFR \u226530 mL/min/1.73 m 2 .

    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (reported in \u226520% of patients) are injection site reactions. (\u200e 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novo Nordisk Inc. at 1-844-906-5099 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of RIVFLOZA has been evaluated in one placebo-controlled clinical trial (PHYOX2) and one open-label extension study (PHYOX3). Across these studies, 29 adults and 12 children with PH1 have been treated with RIVFLOZA. Patients with PH1 in these studies ranged in age from 9 to 46 years at first dose. The median duration of exposure was approximately 15 months (range 1-29 months). Overall, 38 patients with PH1 were treated for at least 6 months, 24 patients for at least 12 months, and 16 patients for at least 18 months. In the randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind PHYOX2 trial in pediatric and adult patients 9 to 46 years of age, 18 patients with PH1 received RIVFLOZA and 11\u00a0patients received placebo. Of the 18 patients treated with RIVFLOZA, 17 patients received \u22655 months of active treatment. The most common adverse reactions were injection site reactions, which were reported in 7 patients with PH1 (39%) on RIVFLOZA as compared to no patients on placebo. Injection site reactions included erythema, pain, bruising, and rash and were generally mild and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. In the single-arm extension study (PHYOX3) that included 40 patients with PH1, additional injection site reactions included atrophy in 1 patient (3%). The safety of RIVFLOZA has additionally been evaluated in one single-arm clinical study (PHYOX8) in 15 pediatric patients 2 to less than 12 years of age with PH1 and an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Injection site reactions were reported in 2 patients (13%). Overall, the RIVFLOZA safety profile was similar to that seen in PHYOX2.",
