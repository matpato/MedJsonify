    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see section). DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine HCl should not be used in patients who have previously exhibited hypersensitivity to it. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "PRECAUTIONS General A yellowish tinge of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation due to impaired renal excretion and the need to discontinue therapy. The decline in renal function associated with advanced age should be kept in mind. NOTE: Patients should be informed that Phenazopyridine HCl produces a reddish-orange discoloration of the urine and may stain fabric. Staining of contact lenses has been reported. Laboratory Test Interaction Due to its properties as an azo dye, Phenazopyridine HCl may interfere with urinalysis based on spectrometry or color reactions. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers No information is available on the appearance of Phenazopyridine HCl, or its metabolites in human milk.",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Headache, rash, pruritus and occasional gastrointestinal disturbance. An anaphylactoid-like reaction has been described. Methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, renal and hepatic toxicity have been reported, usually at overdosage levels (see section). OVERDOSAGE To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.",
