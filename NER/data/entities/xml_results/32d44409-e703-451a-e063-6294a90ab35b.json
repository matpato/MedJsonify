Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity to daratumumab or any of the components of the formulation. ( 4 )",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-related reactions : Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for infusion-related reactions of any severity. Permanently discontinue the infusion in case of anaphylactic reactions or life-threatening infusion-related reactions and institute appropriate emergency care. ( 2.4 , 5.1 ) Interference with cross-matching and red blood cell antibody screening : Type and screen patients prior to starting treatment. Inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. ( 5.2 , 7.1 ) Neutropenia : Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Dose delay may be required to allow recovery of neutrophils. ( 5.3 ) Thrombocytopenia : Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment. Dose delay may be required to allow recovery of platelets. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception. ( 5.6 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Infusion-Related Reactions DARZALEX can cause severe and/or serious infusion-related reactions including anaphylactic reactions. These reactions can be life-threatening and fatal outcomes have been reported [see . Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] In clinical trials (monotherapy and combination: N=2,066), infusion-related reactions occurred in 37% of patients with the Week 1 (16 mg/kg) infusion, 2% with the Week 2 infusion, and cumulatively 6% with subsequent infusions. Less than 1% of patients had a Grade 3/4 infusion-related reaction at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. The median time to onset was 1.5 hours (range: 0 to 73 hours). The incidence of infusion modification due to reactions was 36%. Median durations of 16 mg/kg infusions for the Week 1, Week 2, and subsequent infusions were approximately 7, 4, and 3 hours respectively. Nearly all reactions occurred during infusion or within 4 hours of completing DARZALEX. Prior to the introduction of post-infusion medication in clinical trials, infusion-related reactions occurred up to 48 hours after infusion. Severe reactions have occurred, including bronchospasm, hypoxia, dyspnea, hypertension, tachycardia, headache, laryngeal edema, pulmonary edema, and ocular adverse reactions, including choroidal effusion, acute myopia, and acute angle closure glaucoma. Signs and symptoms may include respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation, as well as chills, vomiting and nausea. Less common signs and symptoms were wheezing, allergic rhinitis, pyrexia, chest discomfort, pruritus, hypotension, and blurred vision [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] When DARZALEX dosing was interrupted in the setting of ASCT (CASSIOPEIA) for a median of 3.75 months (range: 2.4 to 6.9 months), upon re-initiation of DARZALEX, the incidence of infusion-related reactions was 11% for the first infusion following ASCT. Infusion rate/dilution volume used upon re-initiation was that used for the last DARZALEX infusion prior to interruption for ASCT. Infusion-related reactions occurring at re-initiation of DARZALEX following ASCT were consistent in terms of symptoms and severity (Grade 3 or 4: <1%) with those reported in previous studies at Week 2 or subsequent infusions. In EQUULEUS, patients receiving combination treatment (n=97) were administered the first 16 mg/kg dose at Week 1 split over two days i.e. 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 2, respectively. The incidence of any grade infusion-related reactions was 42%, with 36% of patients experiencing infusion-related reactions on Day 1 of Week 1, 4% on Day 2 of Week 1, and 8% with subsequent infusions. The median time to onset of a reaction was 1.8 hours (range: 0.1 to 5.4 hours). The incidence of infusion interruptions due to reactions was 30%. Median durations of infusions were 4.2 hours for Week 1-Day 1, 4.2 hours for Week 1-Day 2, and 3.4 hours for the subsequent infusions. Pre-medicate patients with antihistamines, antipyretics and corticosteroids. Frequently monitor patients during the entire infusion [see . Interrupt DARZALEX infusion for reactions of any severity and institute medical management as needed. Permanently discontinue DARZALEX therapy if an anaphylactic reaction or life-threatening (Grade 4) reaction occurs and institute appropriate emergency care. For patients with Grade 1, 2, or 3 reactions, reduce the infusion rate when re-starting the infusion Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] To reduce the risk of delayed infusion-related reactions, administer oral corticosteroids to all patients following DARZALEX infusions [see . Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require additional post-infusion medications to manage respiratory complications. Consider prescribing short- and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] [see . Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] Ocular adverse reactions, including acute myopia and narrowing of the anterior chamber angle due to ciliochoroidal effusions with potential for increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma, have occurred with DARZALEX infusion. If ocular symptoms occur, interrupt DARZALEX infusion and seek immediate ophthalmologic evaluation prior to restarting DARZALEX. 5.2 Interference with Serological Testing Daratumumab binds to CD38 on red blood cells (RBCs) and results in a positive Indirect Antiglobulin Test (Indirect Coombs test). Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect antiglobulin test may persist for up to 6 months after the last daratumumab infusion. Daratumumab bound to RBCs masks detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient's serum [see . The determination of a patient's ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted References (15) ] [see . Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Notify blood transfusion centers of this interference with serological testing and inform blood banks that a patient has received DARZALEX. Type and screen patients prior to starting DARZALEX [see . Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] 5.3 Neutropenia DARZALEX may increase neutropenia induced by background therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection. Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of neutrophils. 5.4 Thrombocytopenia DARZALEX may increase thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Monitor complete blood cell counts periodically during treatment according to manufacturer's prescribing information for background therapies. Consider withholding DARZALEX until recovery of platelets. 5.5 Interference with Determination of Complete Response Daratumumab is a human IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both, the serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical monitoring of endogenous M-protein [see . This interference can impact the determination of complete response and of disease progression in some patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. Drug Interactions (7.1) ] 5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action, DARZALEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. DARZALEX may cause depletion of fetal immune cells and decreased bone density. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females with reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DARZALEX and for 3 months after the last dose [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ] The combination of DARZALEX with lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women, because lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide may cause birth defects and death of the unborn child. Refer to the lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or thalidomide prescribing information on use during pregnancy.",

Infections Grade 3 or 4 infections were reported as follows: Relapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 21% vs. Vd: 19%; DRd: 28% vs. Rd: 23%; DPd: 28%; DKd where carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m\n             2 was administered twice-weekly : 37%, Kd : 29%; DKd where carfilzomib 20/70 mg/m\n             2 was administered once-weekly : 21% Newly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 23%, VMP: 15%; DRd: 32%, Rd: 23%; DVTd: 22%; VTd: 20%. Pneumonia was the most commonly reported severe (Grade 3 or 4) infection across studies. In active controlled studies, discontinuations from treatment due to infections occurred in 1\u20134% of patients. Fatal infections (Grade 5) were reported as follows: Relapsed/refractory patient studies: DVd: 1%, Vd: 2%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 1%; DPd: 2%; DKd : 5%, Kd : 3%; DKd : 0% Newly diagnosed patient studies: D-VMP: 1%, VMP: 1%; DRd: 2%, Rd: 2%; DVTd: 0%, VTd: 0%. Fatal infections were generally infrequent and balanced between the DARZALEX containing regimens and active control arms. Fatal infections were primarily due to pneumonia and sepsis. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation has been reported in less than 1% of patients (including fatal cases) treated with DARZALEX in clinical trials. Other Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported following administration of daratumumab and hyaluronidase for subcutaneous injection: Nervous System disorders: Syncope 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of daratumumab. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System disorders: Anaphylactic reaction, IRR (including deaths) Gastrointestinal disorders: Pancreatitis Infections: Cytomegalovirus, Listeriosis",
