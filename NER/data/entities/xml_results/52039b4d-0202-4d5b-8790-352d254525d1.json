    "contraindications_original": "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS AVODART is contraindicated for use in: \u2022 Pregnancy. Dutasteride use is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies, dutasteride inhibited development of male fetus external genitalia. Therefore, AVODART may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Warnings and Precautions ( . 5.4 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] \u2022 Patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity (e.g., serious skin reactions, angioedema) to AVODART or other 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.2 )] \u2022 Pregnancy. Dutasteride use is contraindicated in women who are pregnant.

    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 AVODART reduces serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration by approximately 50%. However, any confirmed increase in PSA while on AVODART may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if those values are still within the normal range for untreated men. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 AVODART may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. ( 5.2 , 6.1 ) \u2022 Prior to initiating treatment with AVODART, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Women who are pregnant or may be pregnant should not handle AVODART capsules due to potential risk to a male fetus. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Patients should not donate blood until 6\u00a0months after their last dose of AVODART. ( 5.5 ) 5.1 Effects on Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical trials, AVODART reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50% within 3 to 6\u00a0months of treatment. This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in subjects with symptomatic BPH, although it may vary in individuals. AVODART may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer. To interpret serial PSAs in men taking AVODART, a new PSA baseline should be established at least 3\u00a0months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter. Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on AVODART may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated, even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. Noncompliance with AVODART may also affect PSA test results. To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with AVODART for 3\u00a0months or more, the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men. The free-to-total PSA ratio (percent free PSA) remains constant, even under the influence of AVODART. If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving AVODART, no adjustment to its value appears necessary. Coadministration of dutasteride and tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as dutasteride monotherapy. 5.2 Increased Risk of High-grade Prostate Cancer In men aged 50 to 75\u00a0years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2.5\u00a0ng/mL and 10.0\u00a0ng/mL taking AVODART in the 4-year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial, there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo (AVODART 1.0% versus placebo 0.5%) [see Indications and Usage ( . In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5\u00a0mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%). 1.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high-grade prostate cancer. Whether the effect of 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume or trial-related factors impacted the results of these trials has not been established. 5.3 Evaluation for Other Urological Diseases Prior to initiating treatment with AVODART, consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In addition, BPH and prostate cancer may coexist. 5.4 Transdermal Exposure of AVODART in Pregnant Women\u2014Risk to Male Fetus AVODART capsules should not be handled by women who are pregnant or may be pregnant. Dutasteride can be absorbed through the skin and could result in unintended fetal exposure and potential risk to a male fetus. If a pregnant woman comes in contact with leaking dutasteride capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [see Use in Specific Populations ( . Dutasteride can be absorbed through the skin based on animal studies 8.1 )] [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( . 13.2 )] 5.5 Blood Donation Men being treated with AVODART should not donate blood until at least 6\u00a0months have passed following their last dose. The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of dutasteride to a pregnant female transfusion recipient. 5.6 Effect on Semen Characteristics The effects of dutasteride 0.5\u00a0mg/day on semen characteristics were evaluated in healthy men throughout 52\u00a0weeks of treatment and 24\u00a0weeks of post\u2011treatment follow\u2011up. At 52\u00a0weeks, compared with placebo, dutasteride treatment resulted in mean reduction in total sperm count, semen volume, and sperm motility; the effects on total sperm count were not reversible after 24 weeks of follow-up. Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected and mean values for all semen parameters remained within the normal range at all timepoints. The clinical significance of the effect of dutasteride on semen characteristics for an individual patient\u2019s fertility is not known [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.3 )]",
    "adverseReactions_original": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions, reported in \u22651% of subjects treated with AVODART and more commonly than in subjects treated with placebo, are impotence, decreased libido, ejaculation disorders, and breast disorders. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Waylis Therapeutics LLC at 888-514-4727 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. From clinical trials with AVODART as monotherapy or in combination with tamsulosin: \u2022 The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving AVODART were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), and ejaculation disorders. The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving combination therapy (AVODART plus tamsulosin) were impotence, decreased libido, breast disorders (including breast enlargement and tenderness), ejaculation disorders, and dizziness. Ejaculation disorders occurred significantly more in subjects receiving combination therapy (11%) compared with those receiving AVODART (2%) or tamsulosin (4%) as monotherapy. \u2022 Trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 4% of subjects receiving AVODART and 3% of subjects receiving placebo in placebo-controlled trials with AVODART. The most common adverse reaction leading to trial withdrawal was impotence (1%). \u2022 In the clinical trial evaluating the combination therapy, trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 6% of subjects receiving combination therapy (AVODART plus tamsulosin) and 4% of subjects receiving AVODART or tamsulosin as monotherapy. The most common adverse reaction in all treatment arms leading to trial withdrawal was erectile dysfunction (1% to 1.5%). Monotherapy Over 4,300\u00a0male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5-mg daily doses of AVODART in 3 identical 2-year, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase\u00a03 treatment trials, each followed by a 2-year open-label extension. During the double-blind treatment period, 2,167\u00a0male subjects were exposed to AVODART, including 1,772 exposed for 1\u00a0year and 1,510 exposed for 2\u00a0years. When including the open-label extensions, 1,009\u00a0male subjects were exposed to AVODART for 3\u00a0years and 812 were exposed for 4\u00a0years. The population was aged 47 to 94\u00a0years (mean age: 66\u00a0years) and greater than 90% were white. Table 1 summarizes clinical adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects receiving AVODART and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving placebo. Table 1. Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22651% of Subjects over a 24-Month Period and More Frequently in the Group Receiving AVODART than the Placebo Group (Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials Pooled) by Time of Onset a These sexual adverse reactions are associated with dutasteride treatment (including monotherapy and combination with tamsulosin). These adverse reactions may persist after treatment discontinuation. The role of dutasteride in this persistence is unknown. b Includes breast tenderness and breast enlargement.

Subjects were randomized to receive placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a04,126) or 0.5-mg daily doses of AVODART (n\u00a0=\u00a04,105) for up to 4\u00a0years. The mean age was 63\u00a0years and 91% were white. Subjects underwent protocol-mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4\u00a0years of treatment or had \u201cfor-cause biopsies\u201d at non-scheduled times if clinically indicated. There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer in men receiving AVODART (1.0%) compared with men on placebo (0.5%) [see Indications and Usage ( In a 7-year placebo-controlled clinical trial with another 5\u00a0alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride 5\u00a0mg, PROSCAR), similar results for Gleason score 8-10 prostate cancer were observed (finasteride 1.8% versus placebo 1.1%). 1.3 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with AVODART. Reproductive and Breast Disorders In the 3\u00a0pivotal placebo-controlled BPH trials with AVODART, each 4\u00a0years in duration, there was no evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions (impotence, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder) or breast disorders with increased duration of treatment. Among these 3\u00a0trials, there was 1\u00a0case of breast cancer in the dutasteride group and 1\u00a0case in the placebo group. No cases of breast cancer were reported in any treatment group in the 4-year CombAT trial or the 4-year REDUCE trial. The relationship between long-term use of dutasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown. Combination with Alpha-blocker Therapy (CombAT) Over 4,800\u00a0male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive 0.5-mg AVODART, 0.4-mg tamsulosin, or combination therapy (0.5-mg AVODART plus 0.4-mg tamsulosin) administered once daily in a 4-year double-blind trial. Overall, 1,623\u00a0subjects received monotherapy with AVODART; 1,611\u00a0subjects received monotherapy with tamsulosin; and 1,610\u00a0subjects received combination therapy. The population was aged 49 to 88\u00a0years (mean age: 66\u00a0years) and 88% were white. Table 2 summarizes adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of subjects in the combination group and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving monotherapy with AVODART or tamsulosin. Table 2. Adverse Reactions Reported over a 48-Month Period in \u22651% of Subjects and More Frequently in the Coadministration Therapy Group than the Groups Receiving Monotherapy with AVODART or Tamsulosin (CombAT) by Time of Onset a Combination = AVODART 0.5\u00a0mg once daily plus tamsulosin 0.4\u00a0mg once daily. b Includes anorgasmia, retrograde ejaculation, semen volume decreased, orgasmic sensation decreased, orgasm abnormal, ejaculation delayed, ejaculation disorder, ejaculation failure, and premature ejaculation. c These sexual adverse reactions are associated with dutasteride treatment (including monotherapy and combination with tamsulosin). These adverse reactions may persist after treatment discontinuation. The role of dutasteride in this persistence is unknown. d Includes erectile dysfunction and disturbance in sexual arousal. e Includes libido decreased, libido disorder, loss of libido, sexual dysfunction, and male sexual dysfunction. f Includes breast enlargement, gynecomastia, breast swelling, breast pain, breast tenderness, nipple pain, and nipple swelling.

Composite cardiac failure was also examined in a separate 4-year placebo-controlled trial evaluating AVODART in men at risk for development of prostate cancer. The incidence of cardiac failure in subjects taking AVODART was 0.6% (26/4,105) compared with 0.4% (15/4,126) in subjects on placebo. A majority of subjects with cardiac failure in both trials had comorbidities associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure. Therefore, the clinical significance of the numerical imbalances in cardiac failure is unknown. No causal relationship between AVODART alone or in combination with tamsulosin and cardiac failure has been established. No imbalance was observed in the incidence of overall cardiovascular adverse events in either trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of AVODART. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to AVODART. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, pruritus, urticaria, localized edema, serious skin reactions, and angioedema. Neoplasms Male breast cancer. Psychiatric Disorders Depressed mood. Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Testicular pain and testicular swelling.",
