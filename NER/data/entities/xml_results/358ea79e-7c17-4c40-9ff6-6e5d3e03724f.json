( 5.1 ) o Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) o Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression. Potent corticosteroids use on large areas, prolonged use or occlusive use, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age may increase systemic absorption. Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Local Adverse Reactions: Local adverse reactions may include atrophy, striae irritation, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and allergic contact dermatitis, and may be more likely with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids. ( 5.2 , 6.1 ) \u2022 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions: May increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% ear drops with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Endocrine System Adverse Reactions Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids. HPA axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and subnormal response to ACTH stimulation. Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations ( . 8.4 )] Conditions which increase systemic absorption include the use of more potent corticosteroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase total systemic corticosteroid exposure. Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. The ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. 5.2 Local Adverse Reactions Local adverse reactions may occur with use of topical corticosteroids, including fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% ear drops, and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use, or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria [see Adverse Reactions ( . 6.1 )] 5.3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risks of glaucoma and posterior subcapsular cataract. Glaucoma and cataracts have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products. Avoid contact of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% ear drops with eyes. Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. 5.4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Use of topical corticosteroids can cause allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis to any component of topical corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by a failure to heal rather than a clinical exacerbation. Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed by patch testing. 5.5 Concomitant Skin Infections Use of topical corticosteroids may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. Treat concomitant skin infections with an appropriate antimicrobial agent. If the infection persists unchanged, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% ear drops until the infection has been adequately treated. 5.6 Use in Peanut Sensitive Individuals Use caution in prescribing fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% ear drops for peanut sensitive individuals [see Description ( . 11 )] Should signs of hypersensitivity present (wheal and flare reactions, pruritus, or other manifestations), or should disease exacerbations occur, discontinue fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% ear drops immediately and institute appropriate therapy.",

In trials that enrolled 154 subjects (adults and pediatric subjects 2 years and older) with chronic eczematous external otitis who were treated with five drops per ear of fluocinolone acetonide oil, 0.01% ear drops twice daily for a maximum 14 days of treatment, the following adverse reactions were reported: Table 1: Adverse Reactions in \u2265 1% of Fluocinolone Acetonide Oil, 0.01% Ear Drops-Treated Adult and Pediatric Subjects 2 Years of Age and Older with Chronic Eczematous External Otitis, N=154 Adverse Reaction n (%) Headache 4 (3) URI 3 (2) Cough 3 (2) Eczematous otitis 2 (1) 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of products containing topical corticosteroids. Because postmarketing adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 Endocrine Disorders: HPA axis suppression and Cushing\u2019s syndrome [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] \u2022 Eye Disorders: glaucoma and cataracts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u2022 Nervous System Disorders: intracranial hypertension including bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]",
