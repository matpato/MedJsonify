( 5.12 ) 5.1\tGastrointestinal Perforations and Fistulae Serious, and sometimes fatal, gastrointestinal perforation occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from 0.3% to 3% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with a history of prior pelvic radiation. Perforation can be complicated by intra-abdominal abscess, fistula formation, and the need for diverting ostomies. The majority of perforations occurred within 50 days of the first dose [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Serious fistulae (including, tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, biliary, vaginal, renal and bladder sites) occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. The incidence ranged from < 1% to 1.8% across clinical studies, with the highest incidence in patients with cervical cancer. The majority of fistulae occurred within 6 months of the first dose. Patients who develop a gastrointestinal vaginal fistula may also have a bowel obstruction and require surgical intervention, as well as a diverting ostomy. Avoid Jobevne in patients with ovarian cancer who have evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Discontinue in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforation, tracheoesophageal fistula or any Grade 4 fistula. Discontinue in patients with fistula formation involving any internal organ . 5.2\tSurgery and Wound Healing Complications In a controlled clinical study in which bevacizumab was not administered within 28 days of major surgical procedures, the incidence of wound healing complications, including serious and fatal complications, was 15% in patients with mCRC who underwent surgery while receiving bevacizumab and 4% in patients who did not receive bevacizumab. In a controlled clinical study in patients with relapsed or recurrent GBM, the incidence of wound healing events was 5% in patients who received bevacizumab and 0.7% in patients who did not receive bevacizumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. In patients who experience wound healing complications during Jobevne treatment, withhold Jobevne until adequate wound healing. Withhold for at least 28 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 28 days following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of bevacizumab products after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established [see . Dosage and Administration (2.8) ] Necrotizing fasciitis including fatal cases, has been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab, usually secondary to wound healing complications, gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation. Discontinue Jobevne in patients who develop necrotizing fasciitis . 5.3\tHemorrhage Bevacizumab products can result in two distinct patterns of bleeding: minor hemorrhage, which is most commonly Grade 1 epistaxis, and serious hemorrhage, which in some cases has been fatal. Severe or fatal hemorrhage, including hemoptysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, CNS hemorrhage, epistaxis, and vaginal bleeding, occurred up to 5-fold more frequently in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-5 hemorrhagic events ranged from 0.4% to 7% in patients receiving bevacizumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Serious or fatal pulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 31% of patients with squamous NSCLC and 4% of patients with non-squamous NSCLC receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to none of the patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Do not administer Jobevne to patients with recent history of hemoptysis of 1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood. Discontinue in patients who develop a Grades 3-4 hemorrhage. 5.4\tArterial Thromboembolic Events Serious, sometimes fatal, arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) including cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarction, and angina, occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-5 ATE was 5% in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to \u2264 2% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone; the highest incidence occurred in patients with GBM. The risk of developing ATE was increased in patients with a history of arterial thromboembolism, diabetes, or > 65 years [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe ATE. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products after an ATE is resolved is not known. 5.5\tVenous Thromboembolic Events An increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) was observed across clinical studies [see . In Study GOG-0240, Grades 3-4 VTE occurred in 11% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared with 5% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In EORTC 26101, the incidence of Grades 3-4 VTE was 5% in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 2% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Discontinue Jobevne in patients with a Grade 4 VTE, including pulmonary embolism . 5.6\tHypertension Severe hypertension occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving bevacizumab products as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Across clinical studies, the incidence of Grades 3-4 hypertension ranged from 5% to 18%. Monitor blood pressure every two to three weeks during treatment with Jobevne. Treat with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy and monitor blood pressure regularly. Continue to monitor blood pressure at regular intervals in patients with Jobevne-induced or -exacerbated hypertension after discontinuing Jobevne. Withhold Jobevne in patients with severe hypertension (such as Grade 3 and above) until controlled with medical management; resume once controlled with medical management. Discontinue in patients who develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. 5.7\tPosterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was reported in < 0.5% of patients across clinical studies. The onset of symptoms occurred from 16 hours to 1 year after the first dose. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES. Discontinue Jobevne in patients who develop PRES. Symptoms usually resolve or improve within days after discontinuing bevacizumab products, although some patients have experienced ongoing neurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab products in patients who developed PRES is not known. 5.8\tRenal Injury and Proteinuria The incidence and severity of proteinuria was higher in patients receiving bevacizumab as compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. Grade 3 (defined as urine dipstick 4+ or > 3.5 grams of protein per 24 hours) to Grade 4 (defined as nephrotic syndrome) ranged from 0.7% to 7% in clinical studies. The overall incidence of proteinuria (all grades) was only adequately assessed in Study BO17705, in which the incidence was 20%. Median onset of proteinuria was 5.6 months (15 days to 37 months) after initiating bevacizumab. Median time to resolution was 6.1 months (95% CI: 2.8, 11.3). Proteinuria did not resolve in 40% of patients after median follow-up of 11.2 months and required discontinuation of bevacizumab in 30% of the patients who developed proteinuria [see . Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] In an exploratory, pooled analysis of patients from seven randomized clinical studies, 5% of patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy experienced Grades 2-4 (defined as urine dipstick 2+ or greater or > 1 gram of protein per 24 hours or nephrotic syndrome) proteinuria. Grades 2-4 proteinuria resolved in 74% of patients. Bevacizumab was reinitiated in 42% of patients. Of the 113 patients who reinitiated bevacizumab, 48% experienced a second episode of Grades 2-4 proteinuria. Nephrotic syndrome occurred in < 1% of patients receiving bevacizumab across clinical studies, in some instances with fatal outcome. In a published case series, kidney biopsy of 6 patients with proteinuria showed findings consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. Results of a retrospective analysis of 5805 patients who received bevacizumab with chemotherapy and 3713 patients who received chemotherapy alone, showed higher rates of elevated serum creatinine levels (between 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline levels) in patients who received bevacizumab. Serum creatinine levels did not return to baseline in approximately one-third of patients who received bevacizumab. Monitor proteinuria by dipstick urine analysis for the development or worsening of proteinuria with serial urinalyses during Jobevne therapy. Patients with a 2+ or greater urine dipstick reading should undergo further assessment with a 24-hour urine collection. Withhold for proteinuria greater than or equal to 2 grams per 24 hours and resume when less than 2 grams per 24 hours. Discontinue in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. Data from a postmarketing safety study showed poor correlation between UPCR (Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratio) and 24-hour urine protein [Pearson Correlation 0.39 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.57)] . 5.9\tInfusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions reported across clinical studies and postmarketing experience include hypertension, hypertensive crises associated with neurologic signs and symptoms, wheezing, oxygen desaturation, Grade 3 hypersensitivity, anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions, chest pain, headaches, rigors, and diaphoresis. In clinical studies, infusion-related reactions with the first dose occurred in < 3% of patients and severe reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients. Decrease the rate of infusion for mild, clinically insignificant infusion-related reactions. Interrupt the infusion in patients with clinically significant infusion-related reactions and consider resuming at a slower rate following resolution. Discontinue in patients who develop a severe infusion-related reaction and administer appropriate medical therapy (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators and/or oxygen). 5.10\tEmbryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, bevacizumab products may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Congenital malformations were observed with the administration of bevacizumab to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis every 3 days at a dose as low as a clinical dose of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, animal models link angiogenesis and VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction, embryo-fetal development, and postnatal development. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Jobevne and for 6 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]. 5.11\tOvarian Failure The incidence of ovarian failure was 34% vs. 2% in premenopausal women receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor. After discontinuing bevacizumab, recovery of ovarian function at all time points during the post-treatment period was demonstrated in 22% of women receiving bevacizumab. Recovery of ovarian function is defined as resumption of menses, a positive serum \u03b2-HCG pregnancy test, or an FSH level < 30 mIU/mL during the post-treatment period. Long-term effects of bevacizumab products on fertility are unknown. Inform females of reproductive potential of the risk of ovarian failure prior to initiating Jobevne [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Use in Specific Populations (8.3) ]. 5.12\tCongestive Heart Failure (CHF) Jobevne is not indicated for use with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The incidence of Grade \u2265 3 left ventricular dysfunction was 1% in patients receiving bevacizumab compared to 0.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Among patients who received prior anthracycline treatment, the rate of CHF was 4% for patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy as compared to 0.6% for patients receiving chemotherapy alone. In previously untreated patients with a hematological malignancy, the incidence of CHF and decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were increased in patients receiving bevacizumab with anthracycline-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving placebo with the same chemotherapy regimen. The proportion of patients with a decline in LVEF from baseline of \u2265 20% or a decline from baseline of 10% to < 50%, was 10% in patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 5% in patients receiving chemotherapy alone. Time to onset of left-ventricular dysfunction or CHF was 1 to 6 months after the first dose in at least 85% of the patients and was resolved in 62% of the patients who developed CHF in the bevacizumab arm compared to 82% in the placebo arm. Discontinue Jobevne in patients who develop CHF.",

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Biocon Biologics at 1-833-986-1468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1\tClinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data in Warnings and Precautions and described below reflect exposure to bevacizumab in 4463 patients including those with mCRC (AVF2107g, E3200), non-squamous NSCLC (E4599), GBM (EORTC 26101), mRCC (BO17705), cervical cancer (GOG-0240), and epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (MO22224 AVF4095, GOG-0213, and GOG-0218) or another cancers at the recommended dose and schedule for a median of 6 to 23 doses. The most common adverse reactions observed in patients receiving bevacizumab as a single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer therapies at a rate > 10% were epistaxis, headache, hypertension, rhinitis, proteinuria, taste alteration, dry skin, hemorrhage, lacrimation disorder, back pain, and exfoliative dermatitis. Across clinical studies, bevacizumab was discontinued in 8% to 22% of patients because of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Metastatic Colorectal Cancer In Combination with bolus-IFL The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 392 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a double-blind, active-controlled study (AVF2107g), which compared bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with bolus-IFL to placebo with bolus-IFL in patients with mCRC [see . Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to placebo with bolus-IFL, bevacizumab with bolus-IFL, or bevacizumab with fluorouracil and leucovorin. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. All Grades 3\u22124 adverse reactions and selected Grades 1\u22122 adverse reactions (i.e., hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events) were collected in the entire study population. Adverse reactions are presented in Table 2. Clinical Studies (14.1) ] Table 2: Grades 3-4 Adverse Reactions Occurring at Higher Incidence (\u2265 2%) in Patients Receiving Bevacizumab vs. Placebo in Study AVF2107g Adverse Reaction NCI-CTC version 3. Bevacizumab with IFL (N = 392) Placebo with IFL (N = 396) Hematology Leukopenia 37% 31% Neutropenia 21% 14% Gastrointestinal Diarrhea 34% 25% Abdominal pain 8% 5% Constipation 4% 2% Vascular Hypertension 12% 2% Deep vein thrombosis 9% 5% Intra-abdominal thrombosis 3% 1% Syncope 3% 1% General Asthenia 10% 7% Pain 8% 5% In Combination with FOLFOX4 The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 521 patients in an open-label, active-controlled study (E3200) in patients who were previously treated with irinotecan and fluorouracil for initial therapy for mCRC. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to FOLFOX4, bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks prior to FOLFOX4 on Day 1) with FOLFOX4, or bevacizumab alone (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Bevacizumab was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Selected Grades 3\u22125 non-hematologic and Grades 4\u22125 hematologic occurring at a higher incidence (\u2265 2%) in patients receiving bevacizumab with FOLFOX4 compared to FOLFOX4 alone were fatigue (19% vs. 13%), diarrhea (18% vs. 13%), sensory neuropathy (17% vs. 9%), nausea (12% vs. 5%), vomiting (11% vs. 4%), dehydration (10% vs. 5%), hypertension (9% vs. 2%), abdominal pain (8% vs. 5%), hemorrhage (5% vs. 1%), other neurological (5% vs. 3%), ileus (4% vs. 1%) and headache (3% vs. 0%). These data are likely to under-estimate the true adverse reaction rates due to the reporting mechanisms. First-Line Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated as first-line treatment in 422 patients with unresectable NSCLC who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in an active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (E4599) [see . Chemotherapy na\u00efve patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non\u2013squamous NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to receive six 21-day cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). After completion or upon discontinuation of chemotherapy, patients randomized to receive bevacizumab continued to receive bevacizumab alone until disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity. The trial excluded patients with predominant squamous histology (mixed cell type tumors only), CNS metastasis, gross hemoptysis (1/2 teaspoon or more of red blood), unstable angina, or receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Clinical Studies (14.3) ] Only Grades 3-5 non-hematologic and Grades 4-5 hematologic adverse reactions were collected. Grades 3-5 non-hematologic and Grades 4-5 hematologic adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (\u2265 2%) in patients receiving bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone were neutropenia (27% vs. 17%), fatigue (16% vs. 13%), hypertension (8% vs. 0.7%), infection without neutropenia (7% vs. 3%), venous thromboembolism (5% vs. 3%), febrile neutropenia (5% vs. 2%), pneumonitis/pulmonary infiltrates (5% vs. 3%), infection with Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (4% vs. 2%), hyponatremia (4% vs. 1%), headache (3% vs. 1%) and proteinuria (3% vs. 0%). Recurrent Glioblastoma The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized, open-label study (EORTC 26101) in patients with recurrent GBM following radiotherapy and temozolomide of whom 278 patients received at least one dose of bevacizumab and are considered safety evaluable [see . Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) with lomustine or lomustine alone until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. In the bevacizumab with lomustine arm, 22% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions compared with 10% of patients in the lomustine arm. In patients receiving bevacizumab with lomustine, the adverse reaction profile was similar to that observed in other approved indications. Clinical Studies (14.4) ] Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 337 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a multicenter, double-blind study (BO17705) in patients with mRCC. Patients who had undergone a nephrectomy were randomized (1:1) to receive either bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or placebo with interferon alfa [see . Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Clinical Studies (14.5) ] Grades 3-5 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (> 2%) were fatigue (13% vs. 8%), asthenia (10% vs. 7%), proteinuria (7% vs. 0%), hypertension (6% vs. 1%; including hypertension and hypertensive crisis), and hemorrhage (3% vs. 0.3%; including epistaxis, small intestinal hemorrhage, aneurysm ruptured, gastric ulcer hemorrhage, gingival bleeding, hemoptysis, hemorrhage intracranial, large intestinal hemorrhage, respiratory tract hemorrhage, and traumatic hematoma). Adverse reactions are presented in Table 3.

Persistent, Recurrent, or Metastatic Cervical Cancer The safety of bevacizumab was evaluated in 218 patients who received at least one dose of bevacizumab in a multicenter study (GOG-0240) in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer [see . Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks), or paclitaxel and topotecan with or without bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks). The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Clinical Studies (14.6) ] Grades 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (\u2265 2%) in 218 patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 222 patients receiving chemotherapy alone were abdominal pain (12% vs. 10%), hypertension (11% vs. 0.5%), thrombosis (8% vs. 3%), diarrhea (6% vs. 3%), anal fistula (4% vs. 0%), proctalgia (3% vs. 0%), urinary tract infection (8% vs. 6%), cellulitis (3% vs. 0.5%), fatigue (14% vs. 10%), hypokalemia (7% vs. 4%), hyponatremia (4% vs. 1%), dehydration (4% vs. 0.5%), neutropenia (8% vs. 4%), lymphopenia (6% vs. 3%), back pain (6% vs. 3%), and pelvic pain (6% vs. 1%).

Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to carboplatin and paclitaxel without bevacizumab (CPP), carboplatin and paclitaxel with bevacizumab for up to six cycles (CPB15), or carboplatin and paclitaxel with bevacizumab for six cycles followed by bevacizumab as a single agent for up to 16 additional doses (CPB15+). Bevacizumab was given at 15 mg/kg every three weeks. On this trial, 1215 patients received at least one dose of bevacizumab. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Clinical Studies (14.7) ] Grades 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (\u22652%) in either of the bevacizumab arms versus thecontrol arm were fatigue (CPB15+ -9%, CPB15 -6%, CPP -6%), hypertension (CPB15+ -10%, CPB15 -6%,CPP -2%), thrombocytopenia (CPB15+ -21%, CPB15 -20%, CPP -15%) and leukopenia (CPB15+ -51%,CPB15 -53%, CPP -50%).

Patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients had received no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. The trial excluded patients with evidence of recto-sigmoid involvement by pelvic examination or bowel involvement on CT scan or clinical symptoms of bowel obstruction. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Forty percent of patients on the chemotherapy alone arm received bevacizumab alone upon progression. The demographics of the safety population were similar to the demographics of the efficacy population. Clinical Studies (14.8) ] Grades 3-4 adverse reactions occurring at a higher incidence (\u2265 2%) in 179 patients receiving bevacizumab with chemotherapy compared to 181 patients receiving chemotherapy alone were hypertension (6.7% vs. 1.1%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (4.5% vs. 1.7%).

Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of bevacizumab or of other bevacizumab products. In clinical studies for adjuvant treatment of a solid tumor, 0.6% (14/2233) of patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bevacizumab antibodies as detected by an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) based assay. Among these 14 patients, three tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against bevacizumab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The clinical significance of these anti-bevacizumab antibodies is not known. 6.3\tPostmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of bevacizumab products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General: Polyserositis Cardiovascular: Pulmonary hypertension, Mesenteric venous occlusion Gastrointestinal: Gastrointestinal ulcer, Intestinal necrosis, Anastomotic ulceration Hemic and lymphatic: Pancytopenia Hepatobiliary disorders: Gallbladder perforation Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Osteonecrosis of the jaw Renal: Renal thrombotic microangiopathy (manifested as severe proteinuria) Respiratory: Nasal septum perforation Vascular: Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture",
