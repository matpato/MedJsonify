    "warningsAndPrecautions": "WARNINGS DETERIORATION OF ASTHMA Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If the patient needs more doses of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution than usual, this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires re-evaluation of the patient and treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for anti-inflammatory treatment, e.g. , corticosteroids. USE OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS The use of beta-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be given to adding anti-inflammatory agents, e.g. , corticosteroids. PARADOXICAL BRONCHOSPASM Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, albuterol sulfate inhalation solution should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm, when associated with inhaled formulations, frequently occurs with the first use of a new vial. CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution, like all other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after administration of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, albuterol sulfate inhalation solution, like all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. IMMEDIATE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of albuterol, as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema.PRECAUTIONS General Albuterol, as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension; in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator. Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. As with other beta-agonist medications, albuterol may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring potassium supplementation. Informations for Patients The action of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution may last up to 6 hours or longer. Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution should not be used more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution without consulting your physician. If you find that treatment with albuterol sulfate inhalation solution becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms become worse, and/or you need to use the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While you are using albuterol sulfate inhalation solution, other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be taken only as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor or nervousness. If you are pregnant or nursing, contact your physician about use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. Effective use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution includes an understanding of the way it should be administered. See illustrated Instructions for Use. Mixing Different Inhalation Solutions Drug compatibility ( physical and chemical ) , efficacy, and safety of Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established. Drug Interactions Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators or epinephrine should not be used concomitantly with albuterol sulfate inhalation solution. Beta-Blockers Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol sulfate inhalation solution, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances ( e.g. , as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction ) , there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. Diuretics The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics ( such as loop or thiazide diuretics ) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of beta-agonists with non-potassium sparing diuretics. Digoxin Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants: Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility In a 2-year study in Sprague-Dawley rats, albuterol sulfate caused a significant dose-related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at and above dietary doses of 2 mg/kg ( approximately 2 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m 2 basis ) . In another study, this effect was blocked by the co-administration of propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist. In an 18-month study in CD-1 mice, albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses up to 500 mg/kg ( approximately 200 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m 2 basis ) . In a 22-month study in the Golden hamster, albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses up to 50 mg/kg ( approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m 2 basis ) . Albuterol sulfate was not mutagenic in the Ames test with or without metabolic activation using tester strains S. typhimurium TA1537, TA1538, and TA98 or E. coli WP2, WP2 uvrA, and WP67. No forward mutation was seen in yeast strain S. cerevisiae S9 nor any mitotic gene conversion in yeast strain S. cerevisiae JD1 with or without metabolic activation. Fluctuation assays in S. typhimurium TA98 and E. coli WP2, both with metabolic activation, were negative. Albuterol sulfate was not clastogenic in a human peripheral lymphocyte assay or in an AH1 strain mouse micronucleus assay. Reproduction studies in rats demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at oral doses of albuterol sulfate up to 50 mg/kg ( approximately 40 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m 2 basis ) . Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Albuterol has been shown to be teratogenic in mice. A study in CD-1 mice at subcutaneous doses at and above 0.25 mg/kg ( corresponding to less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m 2 basis ) , induced cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 ( 4.5% ) fetuses. At an subcutaneous dose of 2.5 mg/kg ( approximately equal to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on mg/m 2 basis ) , albuterol sulfate induced cleft palate formation in 10 of 108 ( 9.3% ) fetuses. The drug did not induce cleft palate formation when administered at an subcutaneous dose of 0.025 mg/kg ( corresponding to less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on mg/m 2 basis ) . Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 ( 30.5% ) fetuses from females treated with 2.5 mg/kg isoproterenol ( positive control ) admnistered subcutaneously. A reproduction study in Stride Dutch rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19 ( 37% ) fetuses when albuterol was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg dose ( approximately 80 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg/m 2 basis ) . Studies in pregnant rats with titrated Albuterol demonstrated that approximately 10% of the circulating maternal drug is transferred to the fetus. Disposition in the fetal lungs is comparable to maternal lungs; but fetal liver disposition is 1% of the maternal liver levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. Albuterol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. During worldwide marketing experience, various congenital anomalies, including cleft palate and limb defects, have been reported in the offspring of patients being treated with albuterol. Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies. No consistent pattern of defects can be discerned, and a relationship between albuterol use and congenital anomalies has not been established. Labor and Delivery Tocolysis: Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk. Albuterol has not been approved for the management of preterm labor. The benefit:risk ratio when albuterol is administered for tocolysis has not been established. Serious adverse reactions, including maternal pulmonary edema, have been reported during or following treatment of premature labor with beta 2 -agonists, including albuterol. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol in some animal studies, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of albuterol inhalation solution and solution for inhalation in children below the age of 12 years have not been established.",
