    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): MDS/AML occurred in patients exposed to ZEJULA, and some cases were fatal. Monitor patients for hematological toxicity and discontinue if MDS/AML is confirmed. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Bone Marrow Suppression: Test complete blood counts weekly for the first month, monthly for the next 11 months, and periodically thereafter for clinically significant changes. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypertension and Cardiovascular Effects: Monitor blood pressure and heart rate at least weekly for the first 2 months, then monthly for the first year and periodically thereafter during treatment with ZEJULA. Manage with antihypertensive medications and adjustment of the dose of ZEJULA, if necessary. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): PRES has occurred in patients treated with ZEJULA. Discontinue ZEJULA if PRES is confirmed. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: ZEJULA can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.5 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML), including cases with a fatal outcome, have been reported in patients who received ZEJULA. In PRIMA, MDS/AML occurred in 6 out of 484 (1.2%) patients treated with ZEJULA and in 3 out of 244 (1.2%) patients treated with placebo [see . The duration of therapy with ZEJULA in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer therapy-related AML varied from 3.7 months to 2.5\u00a0years. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] In NOVA, of patients within the g BRCA mut cohort, MDS/AML occurred in 10 out of 136 (7%) patients treated with  ZEJULA and in 2 out of 65 (3%) patients treated with placebo [see . The duration of therapy with ZEJULA in patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer-therapy related AML varied from 3.6 months to 5.9 years. Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] All patients who developed secondary MDS/cancer-therapy\u2013related AML had received previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy. For suspected MDS/AML or prolonged hematological toxicities, refer the patient to a hematologist for further evaluation. Discontinue ZEJULA if MDS/AML is confirmed. 5.2 Bone Marrow Suppression Hematologic adverse reactions, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and/or pancytopenia have been reported in patients treated with ZEJULA [see . Adverse Reactions (6) ] In PRIMA, the overall incidences of \u2265Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported in 39%, 31%, and 21%, respectively, of patients receiving ZEJULA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred in 4%, 2%, and 2%, respectively, of patients. In patients who were administered a starting dose of ZEJULA based on baseline weight or platelet count, \u2265Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported in 22%, 23%, and 15%, respectively, of patients receiving ZEJULA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred in 3%, 3%, and 2%, respectively, of patients. In NOVA, \u2265Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia were reported in 29%, 25%, and 20%, respectively, of patients receiving ZEJULA. Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia occurred in 3%, 1%, and 2%, respectively, of patients. Do not start ZEJULA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (\u2264Grade 1). Monitor complete blood counts weekly for the first month, monthly for the next 11 months of treatment, and periodically after this time. If hematological toxicities do not resolve within 28 days following interruption, discontinue ZEJULA and refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. 5.3 Hypertension and Cardiovascular Effects Hypertension and hypertensive crisis have been reported in patients treated with ZEJULA [see . Adverse Reactions (6) ] In PRIMA, Grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 6% of patients treated with ZEJULA compared with 1% of placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 43 days (range: 1 to 531 days) and with a median duration of 12 days (range: 1 to 61 days). There were no discontinuations due to hypertension. In NOVA, Grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 9% of patients treated with ZEJULA compared with 2% of placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 77 days (range: 4 to 504 days) and with a median duration of 15 days (range: 1 to 86 days). Discontinuation due to hypertension occurred in <1% of patients. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate at least weekly for the first 2 months, then monthly for the first year and periodically thereafter during treatment with ZEJULA. Closely monitor patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Medically manage hypertension with antihypertensive medications and adjustment of the dose of ZEJULA, if necessary [see . Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.2 )] 5.4 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) occurred in 0.1% of 2,165 patients treated with ZEJULA in clinical trials and has also been described in postmarketing reports [see Signs and symptoms of PRES include seizure, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging. Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )]. Monitor all patients treated with ZEJULA for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly discontinue ZEJULA and administer appropriate treatment. The safety of reinitiating ZEJULA in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known. 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, ZEJULA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see . ZEJULA has the potential to cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal death since niraparib is genotoxic and targets actively dividing cells in animals and patients (e.g., bone marrow) Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.1 )] [see . Due to the potential risk to a fetus based on its mechanism of action, animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies were not conducted with niraparib. Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of ZEJULA [see . Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.3 )]",

In a pooled safety population of patients (n = 1,314) with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer treated with ZEJULA monotherapy including PRIMA (n = 484), NOVA (n = 367), and another clinical trial (n = 463), the most common adverse reactions >10% were nausea (65%), thrombocytopenia (60%), anemia (56%), fatigue (55%), constipation (39%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), abdominal pain (35%), vomiting (33%), neutropenia (31%), decreased appetite (24%), leukopenia (24%), insomnia (23%), headache (23%), dyspnea (22%), rash (21%), diarrhea (18%), hypertension (17%), cough (16%), dizziness (14%), acute kidney injury (13%), urinary tract infection (12%), and hypomagnesemia (11%). First-Line Maintenance Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Cancer The safety of ZEJULA for the treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer following first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy was studied in the PRIMA trial, a placebo-controlled, double-blind study in which 728 patients received niraparib or placebo. Among patients who received ZEJULA, the median duration of treatment was 11.1\u00a0months (range: 0.03 to 29 months). All Patients Receiving ZEJULA in PRIMA: Serious adverse reactions occurred in 32% of patients receiving ZEJULA. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients were thrombocytopenia (16%), anemia (6%), and small intestinal obstruction (2.9%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.4% of patients, including intestinal perforation and pleural effusion (1 patient each). MDS/AML occurred in 1.2% of patients receiving ZEJULA. Permanent discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients who received ZEJULA. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in >1% of patients who received ZEJULA included thrombocytopenia (3.7%), anemia (1.9%), and nausea and neutropenia (1.2% each). Adverse reactions led to dose reduction or interruption in 80% of patients, most frequently from thrombocytopenia (56%), anemia (33%), and neutropenia (20%). Table 4 and Table 5 summarize the common adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory findings, respectively, observed in all patients treated with ZEJULA in the PRIMA study. Table 4.
