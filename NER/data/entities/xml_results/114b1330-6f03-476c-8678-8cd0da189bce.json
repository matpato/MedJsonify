    "indications_original": "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phytonadione injectable emulsion is indicated in the following coagulation disorders which are due to faulty formation of factors II, VII, IX and X when caused by vitamin K deficiency or interference with vitamin K activity. Phytonadione injectable emulsion is indicated in: anticoagulant-induced prothrombin deficiency caused by coumarin or indanedione derivatives; prophylaxis and therapy of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn; hypoprothrombinemia due to antibacterial therapy; hypoprothrombinemia secondary to factors limiting absorption or synthesis of vitamin K, e.g., obstructive jaundice, biliary fistula, sprue, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, intestinal resection, cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, and regional enteritis; other drug-induced hypoprothrombinemia where it is definitely shown that the result is due to interference with vitamin K\u00a0metabolism, e.g., salicylates.",
    "contraindications_original": "CONTRAINDICATION Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "WARNINGS Benzyl alcohol as a preservative in Bacteriostatic Sodium Chloride Injection has been associated with toxicity in newborns. Data are unavailable on the toxicity of other preservatives in this age group. There is no evidence to suggest that the small amount of benzyl alcohol contained in phytonadione injectable emulsion, when used as recommended, is associated with toxicity. An immediate coagulant effect should not be expected after administration of phytonadione. It takes a minimum of 1 to 2 hours for measurable improvement in the prothrombin time. Whole blood or component therapy may also be necessary if bleeding is severe. Phytonadione will not counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin. When phytonadione is used to correct excessive anticoagulant-induced hypoprothrombinemia, anticoagulant therapy still being indicated, the patient is again faced with the clotting hazards existing prior to starting the anticoagulant therapy. Phytonadione is not a clotting agent, but overzealous therapy with phytonadione injectable emulsion may restore conditions which originally permitted thromboembolic phenomena. Dosage should be kept as low as possible, and prothrombin time should be checked regularly as clinical conditions indicate. Repeated large doses of vitamin K are not warranted in liver disease if the response to initial use of the vitamin is unsatisfactory. Failure to respond to vitamin K may indicate that the condition being treated is inherently unresponsive to vitamin K. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants. WARNING: This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they required large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.PRECAUTIONS Drug Interactions Temporary resistance to prothrombin-depressing anticoagulants may result, especially when larger doses of phytonadione are used. If relatively large doses have been employed, it may be necessary when reinstituting anticoagulant therapy to use somewhat larger doses of the prothrombin-depressing anticoagulant, or to use one which acts on a different principle, such as heparin sodium. Laboratory Tests Prothrombin time should be checked regularly as clinical conditions indicate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility have not been conducted with phytonadione injectable emulsion. Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phytonadione injectable emulsion. It is also not known whether phytonadione injectable emulsion can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Phytonadione injectable emulsion should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when phytonadione injectable emulsion is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Hemolysis, jaundice, and hyperbilirubinemia in neonates, particularly those that are premature, may be related to the dose of phytonadione injectable emulsion. Therefore, the recommended dose should not be exceeded (See ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).",
    "adverseReactions_original": "ADVERSE REACTIONS Deaths have occurred after intravenous and intramuscular administration. (See Box Warning .) Transient \"flushing sensations\" and \"peculiar\" sensations of taste have been observed, as well as rare instances of dizziness, rapid and weak pulse, profuse sweating, brief hypotension, dyspnea, and cyanosis. Pain, swelling, and tenderness at the injection site may occur. The possibility of allergic sensitivity including an anaphylactoid reaction, should be kept in mind. Infrequently, usually after repeated injection, erythematous, indurated, pruritic plaques have occurred; rarely, these have progressed to scleroderma-like lesions that have persisted for long periods. In other cases, these lesions have resembled erythema perstans. Hyperbilirubinemia has been observed in the newborn following administration of phytonadione. This has occurred rarely and primarily with doses above those recommended (See PRECAUTIONS , ).
