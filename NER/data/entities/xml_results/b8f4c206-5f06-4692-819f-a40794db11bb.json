    "warningsAndPrecautions": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Residual Paralysis : Patients with neuromuscular diseases are at higher risk. Use a lower initial bolus dose and consider using a reversal agent in these patients. ( 2.2 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Risk of Seizure : Monitor level of neuromuscular blockade during long-term administration to limit exposure to toxic metabolites ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions and Anaphylaxis : Severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been reported. Consider cross-reactivity among neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing. ( 4 , 5.4 ) \u2022 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Accidental administration can cause death. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Inadequate Anesthesia : Use Cisatracurium Besylate Injection in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia and monitor patients to ensure level of anesthesia is adequate ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Residual Paralysis Cisatracurium besylate has been associated with residual paralysis. Patients with neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis and myasthenic syndrome) and carcinomatosis may be at higher risk of residual paralysis; thus, a lower maximum initial bolus is recommended in these patients [see Dosage and Administration ( . To prevent complications resulting from cisatracurium besylate-associated residual paralysis, extubation is recommended only after the patient has recovered sufficiently from neuromuscular blockade. Consider use of a reversal agent especially in cases where residual paralysis is more likely to occur 2.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.10 )] [see Overdosage ( . 10 )] 5.3 Risk of Seizure Laudanosine, an active metabolite of cisatracurium besylate, has been shown to cause seizures in animals. Cisatracurium besylate \u2013 treated patients with renal or hepatic impairment may have higher metabolite concentrations (including laudanosine) than patients with normal renal and hepatic function [see Clinical Pharmacology ( . Therefore, patients with renal or hepatic impairment receiving extended administration of cisatracurium besylate may be at higher risk of seizures. 12.3 )] The level of neuromuscular blockade during long-term cisatracurium besylate administration should be monitored with a nerve stimulator to titrate cisatracurium besylate administration to the patients\u2019 needs and limit exposure to toxic metabolites. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal and life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, have been reported [see Contraindications ( . There have been reports of wheezing, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, rash and itching following cisatracurium besylate administration in pediatric patients. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, appropriate precautions such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment should be taken. Precautions should also be taken in those patients who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported. 4 )] 5.5 Risk of Death Due to Medication Errors Administration of cisatracurium besylate results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death, a progression that may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated. 5.6 Risks Due to Inadequate Anesthesia Neuromuscular blockade in the conscious patient can lead to distress. Use cisatracurium besylate in the presence of appropriate sedation or general anesthesia. Monitor patients to ensure that the level of anesthesia is adequate. 5.7 Risk for Infection The 20 mL vial of cisatracurium besylate is intended only for administration as an infusion for use in a single patient in the ICU. The 20 mL vial should not be used multiple times because there is a higher risk of infection (the 20 mL vial does not contain a preservative). 5.8 Potentiation of Neuromuscular Blockade Certain drugs may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of cisatracurium besylate including inhalational anesthetics, antibiotics, magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide and quinidine [see Drug Interactions ( . Additionally, acid-base and/or serum electrolyte abnormalities may potentiate the action of neuromuscular blocking agents. Use peripheral nerve stimulation and monitor the clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade to determine the adequacy of the level of neuromuscular blockage and the need to adjust the cisatracurium besylate dosage. 7.1 )] 5.9 Resistance to Neuromuscular Blockade with Certain Drugs Shorter durations of neuromuscular block may occur and cisatracurium besylate infusion rate requirements may be higher in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine [see Drug Interactions ( . Use peripheral nerve stimulation and monitor the clinical signs of neuromuscular blockade to determine the adequacy of neuromuscular blockage and the need to adjust the cisatracurium besylate dosage. 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] 5.10 Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) Cisatracurium besylate has not been studied in MH-susceptible patients. Because MH can develop in the absence of established triggering agents, the clinician should be prepared to recognize and treat MH in any patient undergoing general anesthesia.",
    "adverseReactions": "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (0.1% to 0.4%) were bradycardia, hypotension, flushing, bronchospasm, and rash.

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials of Cisatracurium Besylate in Surgical Patients The data presented below are based on studies involving 945 surgical patients who received cisatracurium besylate in conjunction with other drugs in US and European clinical studies in a variety of procedures [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Table 3 displays adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of less than 1%. Table 3.

One patient experienced bronchospasm. In one of the two ICU studies, a randomized and double-blind study of ICU patients using TOF neuromuscular monitoring, there were two reports of prolonged recovery (range: 167 and 270 minutes) among 28 patients administered cisatracurium besylate and 13 reports of prolonged recovery (range: 90 minutes to 33 hours) among 30 patients administered vecuronium. 14.3 )] 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during post-approval use of cisatracurium besylate in conjunction with one or more anesthetic agents in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to cisatracurium besylate: anaphylaxis, histamine release, prolonged neuromuscular block, muscle weakness, myopathy.",
