    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis : Risk factors include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs, and higher rosuvastatin tablets dosage. Asian patients may be at higher risk for myopathy. Discontinue rosuvastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing rosuvastatin tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. ( ) 5.1 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy (IMNM) : Rare reports of IMNM, an autoimmune myopathy, have been reported with statin use. Discontinue rosuvastatin tablets if IMNM is suspected. ( ) 5.2 Hepatic Dysfunction : Increases in serum transaminases have occurred, some persistent. Rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure have occurred. Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue rosuvastatin tablets. ( ) 5.3 5.1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Rosuvastatin tablets may cause myopathy [muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK)] and rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins, including rosuvastatin tablets. Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater, uncontrolled hypothyroidism, renal impairment, concomitant use with certain other drugs (including other lipid-lowering therapies), and higher rosuvastatin tablets dosage. Asian patients on rosuvastatin tablets may be at higher risk for myopathy [see . The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking rosuvastatin tablets 40 mg daily compared with lower rosuvastatin tablets dosages. and Drug Interactions (7.1) ] Use in Specific Populations (8.8) Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of rosuvastatin tablets with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended. rosuvastatin tablets dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications, darolutamide, and regorafenib [see . Niacin, fibrates, and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis ] Dosage and Administration (2.6) [see ]. Drug Interactions (7.1) Discontinue rosuvastatin tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected. Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if rosuvastatin tablets is discontinued. Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis; shock; severe hypovolemia; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy). Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the rosuvastatin tablets dosage. Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever. 5.2 Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use, including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered. IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; positive anti-HMG CoA reductase antibody; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents. Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary. Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required. Discontinue rosuvastatin tablets if IMNM is suspected. 5.3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of rosuvastatin tablets [see . In most cases, these changes appeared soon after initiation, were transient, were not accompanied by symptoms, and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1.1% of patients taking rosuvastatin tablets versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with rosuvastatin tablets. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including rosuvastatin tablets. ] Adverse Reactions (6.1) Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [see . ] Use in Specific Populations (8.7) Consider liver enzyme testing before rosuvastatin tablets initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter. Rosuvastatin tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [see . If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs, promptly discontinue rosuvastatin tablets. ] Contraindications (4) 5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the Rosuvastatin tablets clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin tablets treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin tablets 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin tablets or comparator statins, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, consider a dose reduction for patients on rosuvastatin tablets therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing. 5.5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins, including rosuvastatin tablets. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin tablets, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [see . Optimize lifestyle measures, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and making healthy food choices. ] Adverse Reactions (6.1)",

In the METEOR study, patients were treated with rosuvastatin tablets 40 mg (n=700) or placebo (n=281) with a mean treatment duration of 1.7 years.

In JUPITER, there was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin tablets (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin tablets treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c >6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin tablets-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see . ] Clinical Studies (14) Adverse reactions reported in \u22652% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 4.

Four of 130 (3%) patients treated with rosuvastatin tablets (2 treated with 10 mg and 2 treated with 20 mg) had increased CK greater than 10 x ULN, compared to 0 of 46 patients on placebo. and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] Clinical Studies (14) 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of rosuvastatin tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood Disorders : thrombocytopenia Hepatobiliary Disorders : hepatitis, jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure Musculoskeletal Disorders : arthralgia, rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use Nervous System Disorders : peripheral neuropathy, rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, and confusion) associated with the use of all statins.
