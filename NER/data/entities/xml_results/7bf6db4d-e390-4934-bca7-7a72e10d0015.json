( 5.8 , 7 ) Activation of Mania/Hypomania : Screen patients for bipolar disorder prior to initiating treatment. ( 2.3 , 5.9 ) Seizures : Use with caution in patients with a seizure disorder. ( 5.10 ) Elevated Cholesterol/Triglycerides : Has been reported with REMERON use. ( 5.11 ) Hyponatremia : May occur as a result of treatment with serotonergic antidepressants, including REMERON/REMERONSolTab. ( 5.12 ) Transaminase Elevations : Clinically significant elevations have occurred. Use with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function. ( 5.13 ) 5.1\tSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 1. Table 1: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18\u201324 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25\u201364 years old 1 fewer patient \u226565 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication of clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing REMERON/REMERONSolTab, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2\tAgranulocytosis In premarketing clinical trials, 2 (1 with Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome) out of 2796 patients treated with REMERON developed agranulocytosis [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/mm 3 with associated signs and symptoms, e.g., fever, infection, etc.] and a third patient developed severe neutropenia (ANC <500/mm 3 without any associated symptoms). For these 3 patients, onset of severe neutropenia was detected on days 61, 9, and 14 of treatment, respectively. All 3 patients recovered after REMERON was stopped. If a patient develops a sore throat, fever, stomatitis, or other signs of infection, along with a low white blood cell (WBC) count, treatment with REMERON/REMERONSolTab should be discontinued and the patient should be closely monitored. 5.3\tSerotonin Syndrome Serotonergic antidepressants, including REMERON/REMERONSolTab, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) ] Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of REMERON/REMERONSolTab with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate REMERON/REMERONSolTab in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking REMERON/REMERONSolTab, discontinue REMERON/REMERONSolTab before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see . Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7) ] Monitor all patients taking REMERON/REMERONSolTab for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with REMERON/REMERONSolTab and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of REMERON/REMERONSolTab with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.4\tAngle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs, including REMERON/REMERONSolTab, may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. 5.5\tQT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes The effect of REMERON (mirtazapine) on QTc interval was assessed in a clinical randomized trial with placebo and positive (moxifloxacin) controls involving 54 healthy volunteers using exposure response analysis. This trial showed a positive relationship between mirtazapine concentrations and prolongation of the QTc interval. However, the degree of QT prolongation observed with both 45 mg and 75 mg (1.67 times the maximum recommended daily dose) doses of mirtazapine was not at a level generally considered to be clinically meaningful. During postmarketing use of mirtazapine, cases of QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death, have been reported [see . The majority of reports occurred in association with overdose or in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation, including concomitant use of QTc-prolonging medicines Adverse Reactions (6.1 , 6.2) ] [see . Exercise caution when REMERON/REMERONSolTab is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation, and in concomitant use with other drugs thought to prolong the QTc interval. Drug Interactions (7) and Overdosage (10) ] 5.6\tDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with postmarketing use of mirtazapine. DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, fever, and/or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, and/or pericarditis. DRESS is sometimes fatal. Discontinue REMERON/REMERONSolTab immediately if DRESS is suspected and institute appropriate treatment [see . Contraindications (4) , Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] 5.7\tIncreased Appetite and Weight Gain In U.S. controlled clinical studies, appetite increase was reported in 17% of patients treated with REMERON, compared to 2% for placebo. In these same trials, weight gain of \u22657% of body weight was reported in 7.5% of patients treated with mirtazapine, compared to 0% for placebo. In a pool of premarketing U.S. clinical studies, including many patients for long-term, open-label treatment, 8% of patients receiving REMERON discontinued for weight gain. In an 8-week-long pediatric clinical trial of doses between 15 to 45 mg/day, 49% of REMERON-treated pediatric patients had a weight gain of at least 7%, compared to 5.7% of placebo-treated patients. The safety and effectiveness of REMERON/REMERONSolTab in pediatric patients with MDD have not been established [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] 5.8\tSomnolence In U.S. controlled studies, somnolence was reported in 54% of patients treated with REMERON, compared to 18% for placebo. In these studies, somnolence resulted in discontinuation for 10.4% of REMERON-treated patients, compared to 2.2% for placebo. It is unclear whether tolerance develops to the somnolent effects of REMERON/REMERONSolTab. Because of the potentially significant effects of REMERON/REMERONSolTab on impairment of performance, caution patients about engaging in activities that require alertness, including operating hazardous machinery and motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that REMERON/REMERONSolTab does not affect them adversely. The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and alcohol with REMERON/REMERONSolTab should be avoided [see . Drug Interactions (7) ] 5.9\tActivation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with REMERON/REMERONSolTab or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.2% of patients treated with REMERON. Prior to initiating treatment with REMERON/REMERONSolTab, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.10\tSeizures REMERON/REMERONSolTab has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. In premarketing clinical trials, 1 seizure was reported among the 2796 U.S. and non-U.S. patients treated with REMERON. REMERON/REMERONSolTab should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder. 5.11\tElevated Cholesterol and Triglycerides In U.S. controlled studies, nonfasting cholesterol increases to \u226520% above the upper limits of normal were observed in 15% of patients treated with REMERON, compared to 7% for placebo. In these same studies, nonfasting triglyceride increases to \u2265500 mg/dL were observed in 6% of patients treated with REMERON, compared to 3% for placebo. 5.12\tHyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with serotonergic antidepressants, including REMERON/REMERONSolTab. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue REMERON/REMERONSolTab and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] 5.13\tTransaminase Elevations Clinically significant ALT (SGPT) elevations (\u22653 times the upper limit of the normal range) were observed in 2.0% (8/424) of patients treated with REMERON in a pool of short-term, U.S. controlled trials, compared to 0.3% (1/328) of placebo patients. While some patients were discontinued for the ALT increases, in other cases, the enzyme levels returned to normal despite continued REMERON treatment. REMERON/REMERONSolTab should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function [see . Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] 5.14\tDiscontinuation Syndrome There have been reports of adverse reactions upon the discontinuation of REMERON/REMERONSolTab (particularly when abrupt), including but not limited to the following: dizziness, abnormal dreams, sensory disturbances (including paresthesia and electric shock sensations), agitation, anxiety, fatigue, confusion, headache, tremor, nausea, vomiting, and sweating, or other symptoms which may be of clinical significance. A gradual reduction in the dosage, rather than an abrupt cessation, is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 5.15\tUse in Patients with Concomitant Illness REMERON/REMERONSolTab has not been systematically evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or other significant heart disease. REMERON was associated with significant orthostatic hypotension in early clinical pharmacology trials with normal volunteers. Orthostatic hypotension was infrequently observed in clinical trials with depressed patients [see . REMERON/REMERONSolTab should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease that could be exacerbated by hypotension (history of myocardial infarction, angina, or ischemic stroke) and conditions that would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medication). Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] 5.16\tRisks in Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). REMERONSolTab contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. REMERONSolTab contains the following amount of phenylalanine: 2.6 mg in 15 mg orally disintegrating tablet, 5.2 mg in 30 mg orally disintegrating tablet, and 7.8 mg in 45 mg orally disintegrating tablet. Before prescribing REMERONSolTab to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including REMERONSolTab.",

The data described below are from clinical trials in which REMERON/REMERONSolTab was administered to 2796 patients in phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. The trials consisted of double-blind controlled and open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed dose, and titration studies. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment Approximately 16% of the 453 patients who received REMERON in U.S. 6-week placebo-controlled clinical trials discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared to 7% of the 361 placebo-treated patients in those studies. The most common reactions leading to discontinuation (\u22651% and at a rate at least twice that of placebo) are included in Table 2. Table 2: Adverse Reactions (\u22651% and at least twice placebo) Leading to Discontinuation of REMERON in 6-Week Clinical Trials in Patients with MDD REMERON (n=453) Placebo (n=361) Somnolence 10.4% 2.2% Nausea 1.5% 0% Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and twice placebo) associated with the use of REMERON are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Adverse Reactions (\u22655% and twice placebo) in 6-Week U.S. Clinical Trials of REMERON in Patients with MDD REMERON (n=453) Placebo (n=361) Somnolence 54% 18% Increased Appetite 17% 2% Weight Gain 12% 2% Dizziness 7% 3% Table 4 enumerates adverse reactions that occurred in \u22651% of REMERON-treated patients, and were more frequent than the placebo-treated patients, who participated in 6-week, U.S. placebo-controlled trials in which patients were dosed in a range of 5 to 60 mg/day. This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least 1 episode of an adverse reaction at some time during their treatment. Table 4: Adverse Reactions (\u22651% and greater than placebo) in 6-Week U.S. Clinical Studies of Remeron in Patients with MDD REMERON (n=453) Placebo (n=361) Body as a Whole Asthenia 8% 5% Flu Syndrome 5% 3% Back Pain 2% 1% Digestive System Dry Mouth 25% 15% Increased Appetite 17% 2% Constipation 13% 7% Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Weight Gain 12% 2% Peripheral Edema 2% 1% Edema 1% 0% Musculoskeletal System Myalgia 2% 1% Nervous System Somnolence 54% 18% Dizziness 7% 3% Abnormal Dreams 4% 1% Thinking Abnormal 3% 1% Tremor 2% 1% Confusion 2% 0% Respiratory System Dyspnea 1% 0% Urogenital System Urinary Frequency 2% 1% ECG Changes The electrocardiograms for 338 patients who received REMERON and 261 patients who received placebo in 6-week, placebo-controlled trials were analyzed. REMERON was associated with a mean increase in heart rate of 3.4 bpm, compared to 0.8 bpm for placebo. The clinical significance of these changes is unknown. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of REMERON The following list does not include reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general or excessively specific so as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo.
