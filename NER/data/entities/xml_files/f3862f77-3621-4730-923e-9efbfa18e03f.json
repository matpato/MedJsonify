    "contraindications_original": "The dosage of MARCAINE SPINAL administered varies with the anesthetic procedure, the vascularity of the tissues, the number of neuronal segments to be blocked, the depth of anesthesia and degree of muscle relaxation required, the duration of anesthesia desired, individual tolerance, and the physical condition of the patient. Administer the smallest dosage and concentration required to produce the desired result. The following are general dosage guidelines: \u2022 MARCAINE SPINAL 6 mg is generally adequate for vaginal delivery. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 MARCAINE SPINAL 7.5 mg is generally adequate for spinal anesthesia for lower extremity and perineal procedures. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 MARCAINE SPINAL 12 mg is generally adequate for lower abdominal procedures. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 MARCAINE SPINAL 7.5 mg to 10.5 mg is generally adequate for Cesarean section. ( 2.2 )",
