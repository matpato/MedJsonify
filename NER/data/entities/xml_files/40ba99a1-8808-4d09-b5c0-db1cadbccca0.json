    "contraindications_original": "Methadone hydrochloride tablets should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of methadone hydrochloride tablets for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1, 5 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse ( 5.1 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with methadone hydrochloride tablets. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments ( 2.1 , 5.2 ). For opioid na\u00efve patients, initiate methadone hydrochloride tablets treatment with 2.5 mg every 8 to 12 hours. ( 2.4 ) To convert to methadone hydrochloride tablets from another opioid, use available conversion factors to obtain estimated dose. ( 2.4 ) Titrate slowly with dose increases no more frequent than every 3 to 5 days. (2.5 ) Do not abruptly discontinue methadone hydrochloride tablets in a physically dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. ( 2.6 , 5.16 ) Initiation of Detoxification and Maintenance Treatment A single dose of 20 to 30 mg may be sufficient to suppress withdrawal syndrome. ( 2.7 )",
