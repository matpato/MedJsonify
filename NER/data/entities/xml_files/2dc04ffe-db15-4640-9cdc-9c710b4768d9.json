    "indications_original": "Temazepam Capsules, USP are indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia (generally 7 to 10 days). For patients with short-term insomnia, instructions in the prescription should indicate that Temazepam Capsules should be used for short periods of time (7 to 10 days).\n                  \n                  The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy were 2 weeks in duration with the final formal assessment of sleep latency performed at the end of treatment.",
    "contraindications_original": "While the recommended usual adult dose is 15 mg before retiring, 7.5 mg may be sufficient for some patients, and others may need 30 mg. In transient insomnia, a 7.5 mg dose may be sufficient to improve sleep latency. In elderly or debilitated patients, it is recommended that therapy be initiated with 7.5 mg until individual responses are determined.\n                  \n                     Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Temazepam Capsules\n                  \n                  \n                     \n                     To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue temazepam or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS, Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence).",
