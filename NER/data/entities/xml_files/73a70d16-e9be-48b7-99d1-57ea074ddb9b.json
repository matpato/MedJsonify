    "indications_original": "In the treatment of both tuberculosis and the meningococcal carrier state, the small number of resistant cells present within large populations of susceptible cells can rapidly become the predominant type. Bacteriologic cultures should be obtained before the start of therapy to confirm the susceptibility of the organism to rifampin and they should be repeated throughout therapy to monitor the response to treatment. Since resistance can emerge rapidly, susceptibility tests should be performed in the event of persistent positive cultures during the course of treatment. If test results show resistance to rifampin and the patient is not responding to therapy, the drug regimen should be modified.",
    "contraindications_original": "Rifampin can be administered by the oral route or by IV infusion (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). IV doses are the same as those for oral. \n                  See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY for dosing information in patients with renal failure.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "RIFADIN IV (rifampin for injection USP) is available in sterile glass vials containing 600 mg rifampin (NDC 0068-0597-01).",
    "adverseReactions_original": "RIFADIN is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to rifampin or any of the components, or to any of the rifamycins.  (See WARNINGS.)\n                  Rifampin is contraindicated in patients who are also receiving ritonavir-boosted saquinavir due to an increased risk of severe hepatocellular toxicity. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.)\n                  Rifampin is contraindicated in patients who are also receiving atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir due to the potential of rifampin to substantially decrease plasma concentrations of these antiviral drugs, which may result in loss of antiviral efficacy and/or development of viral resistance.\n                  Rifampin is contraindicated in patients receiving praziquantel since therapeutically effective blood levels of praziquantel may not be achieved. In patients receiving rifampin who need immediate treatment with praziquantel alternative agents should be considered. However, if treatment with praziquantel is necessary, rifampin should be discontinued 4 weeks before administration of praziquantel. Treatment with rifampin can then be restarted one day after completion of praziquantel treatment.\n                  Rifampin is contraindicated in patients receiving lurasidone. Concomitant use of lurasidone with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) decreased the exposure of lurasidone compared to the use of lurasidone alone. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).",
