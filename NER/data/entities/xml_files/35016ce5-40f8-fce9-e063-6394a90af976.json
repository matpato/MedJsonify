    "indications_original": "Clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The obsessions or compulsions must cause marked distress, be time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning, in order to meet the DSM-III-R (circa 1989) diagnosis of OCD.\n                  \n                  Obsessions are recurrent, persistent ideas, thoughts, images, or impulses that are ego\u00ad-dystonic. Compulsions are repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors performed in response to an obsession or in a stereotyped fashion, and are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable.\n                  \n                  The effectiveness of clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP\u00a0for the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies, including two 10-week studies in adults and one 8-week study in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age. Patients in all studies had moderate-to-severe OCD (DSM-III), with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) ranging from 26 to 28 and a mean baseline rating of 10 on the NIMH Clinical Global Obsessive Compulsive Scale (NIMH-OC). Patients taking CMI experienced a mean reduction of approximately 10 on the YBOCS, representing an average improvement on this scale of 35% to 42% among adults and 37% among children and adolescents. CMI-treated patients experienced a 3.5 unit decrement on the NIMH-OC. Patients on placebo showed no important clinical response on either scale. The maximum dose was 250 mg/day for most adults and 3 mg/kg/day (up to 200 mg) for all children and adolescents.\n                  \n                  The effectiveness of clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP\u00a0for long-term use (i.e., for more than 10 weeks) has not been systematically evaluated in placebo-controlled trials. The physician who elects to use clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP\u00a0for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (\n \n  see\n                     \n                        DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n                     ).",

During initial titration, clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP\u00a0should be given in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. The goal of this initial titration phase is to minimize side effects by permitting tolerance to side effects to develop or allowing the patient time to adapt if tolerance does not develop.\n                  \n                  Because both CMI and its active metabolite, DMI, have long elimination half-lives, the prescriber should take into consideration the fact that steady-state plasma levels may not be achieved until 2 to 3 weeks after dosage change (\n \n  see\n                     \n                        CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n                     ).

During initial titration, clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP should be given in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased gradually over the next several weeks, up to a maximum of 250 mg daily. After titration, the total daily dose may be given once daily at bedtime to minimize daytime sedation.\n                  \n                     Initial Treatment/Dose Adjustment (Children and Adolescents)\n                  \n                  \n                  As with adults, the starting dose is 25 mg daily and should be gradually increased (also given in divided doses with meals to reduce gastrointestinal side effects) during the first 2 weeks, as tolerated, up to a daily maximum of 3 mg/kg or 100 mg, whichever is smaller. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased gradually over the next several weeks up to a daily maximum of 3 mg/kg or 200 mg, whichever is smaller (\n \n  see\n                     \n                        PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use\n                     ).

Although the efficacy of clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP after 10 weeks has not been documented in controlled trials, patients have been continued in therapy under double- blind conditions for up to 1 year without loss of benefit. However, dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for treatment. During maintenance, the total daily dose may be given once daily at bedtime.\n                  \n                  \n                     Switching a Patient To or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) Intended to Treat Psychiatric Disorders\n                  \n                  \n                  At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders and initiation of therapy with clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP.\u00a0 Conversely,\u00a0 at\u00a0 least 14 days should be allowed after stopping clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP\u00a0before starting an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders (\n \n  see\n                     \n                        CONTRAINDICATIONS\n                     ).\n\n \n                  \n                  \n                     Use of Clomipramine Hydrochloride\n                     With Other MAOIs, Such as Linezolid or Methylene Blue\n                  \n                  \n                  Do not start clomipramine hydrochloride capsules, USP in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue because there is increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
