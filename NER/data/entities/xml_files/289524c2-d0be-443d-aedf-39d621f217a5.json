This dose may be administered at the rate of approximately 25 to 50 mg/min. Sufficient time should be allowed to enable a slow circulation to carry the drug to the site of action. If the initial injection of 50 to 100 mg does not produce a desired response, a second dose may be repeated after 5 minutes.\n                        NO MORE THAN 200 TO 300 MG OF LIDOCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE INJECTION, USP SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED DURING A ONE HOUR PERIOD.\n                        This product is for DIRECT INJECTION ONLY.
