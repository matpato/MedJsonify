    "indications_original": "Clindamycin hydrochloride capsules, USP are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria.\n                  Clindamycin hydrochloride capsules, USP are also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of colitis, as described in the     BOXED WARNING, before selecting clindamycin, the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin).   \n                  \n                     Anaerobes:Serious respiratory tract infections such as empyema, anaerobic pneumonitis, and lung abscess; serious skin and soft tissue infections; septicemia; intra-abdominal infections such as peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess (typically resulting from anaerobic organisms resident in the normal gastrointestinal tract); infections of the female pelvis and genital tract such as endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection.   \n                  \n                     Streptococci:Serious respiratory tract infections; serious skin and soft tissue infections.   \n                  \n                     Staphylococci:Serious respiratory tract infections; serious skin and soft tissue infections.   \n                  \n                     Pneumococci:Serious respiratory tract infections.   \n                  Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin hydrochloride capsules, USP and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin hydrochloride capsules, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "If significant diarrhea occurs during therapy, this antibacterial drug should be discontinued (See    BOXED WARNING).  \n                  Administer clindamycin hydrochloride capsules with a full glass of water (6 to 8 ounces, approximately 200 to 250 mL) and at least 30 minutes before lying down to reduce the potential for esophageal irritation (See    ADVERSE REACTIONS).  \n                  \n                     Adults: \n                     Serious infections\u2014150 to 300 mg every 6 hours.

More severe infections - 16 to 20 mg/kg/day (8 to 10 mg/lb/day) divided into three or four equal doses. Clindamycin should be dosed based on total body weight regardless of obesity.  \n                  Clindamycin hydrochloride capsules are not suitable for pediatric patients who are unable to swallow them whole. The capsules do not provide exact mg/kg doses therefore it may be necessary to use the clindamycin palmitate oral solution in some cases.\n                  Serious infections due to anaerobic bacteria are usually treated with clindamycin injection. However, in clinically appropriate circumstances, the physician may elect to initiate treatment or continue treatment with clindamycin hydrochloride capsules.\n                  In cases of \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal infections, treatment should continue for at least 10 days.",
