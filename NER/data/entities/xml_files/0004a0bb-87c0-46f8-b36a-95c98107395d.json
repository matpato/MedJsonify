Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline tablets dosing and then quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. ( 2.1 ) Starting Week: 0.5 mg once daily on days 1 to 3 and 0.5 mg twice daily on days 4 to 7. ( 2.1 ) Continuing Weeks: 1 mg twice daily for a total of 12 weeks. ( 2.1 ) An additional 12 weeks of treatment is recommended for successful quitters to increase likelihood of long-term abstinence. ( 2.1 ) Consider a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline tablets for patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should begin varenicline tablets dosing and reduce smoking by 50% from baseline within the first four weeks, by an additional 50% in the next four weeks, and continue reducing with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. Continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks. ( 2.1 ) Severe Renal Impairment (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min): Begin with 0.5 mg once daily and titrate to 0.5 mg twice daily. For patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, a maximum of 0.5 mg daily may be given if tolerated. ( 2.2 ) Consider dose reduction for patients who cannot tolerate adverse effects. ( 2.1 ) Another attempt at treatment is recommended for those who fail to stop smoking or relapse when factors contributing to the failed attempt have been addressed. ( 2.1 ) Provide patients with appropriate educational materials and counseling to support the quit attempt. ( 2.1 )",
