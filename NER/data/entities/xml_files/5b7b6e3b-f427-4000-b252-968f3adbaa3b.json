Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline tablet dosing and then quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Starting Week: 0.5 mg once daily on days 1-3 and 0.5 mg twice daily on days 4-7. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Continuing Weeks: 1 mg twice daily for a total of 12 weeks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 An additional 12 weeks of treatment is recommended for successful quitters to increase likelihood of long-term abstinence. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Consider a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline tablets for patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly. Patients should begin varenicline tablet dosing and reduce smoking by 50% from baseline within the first four weeks, by an additional 50% in the next four weeks, and continue reducing with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. Continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Severe Renal Impairment (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min): Begin with 0.5 mg once daily and titrate to 0.5 mg twice daily. For patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis, a maximum of 0.5 mg daily may be given if tolerated. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Consider dose reduction for patients who cannot tolerate adverse effects. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Another attempt at treatment is recommended for those who fail to stop smoking or relapse when factors contributing to the failed attempt have been addressed.
