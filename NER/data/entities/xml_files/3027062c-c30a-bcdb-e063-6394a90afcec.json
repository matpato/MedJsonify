Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.",

There is no need to adjust single dose therapy for vaginal candidiasis because of impaired renal function. In patients with impaired renal function who will receive multiple doses of fluconazole, an initial loading dose of 50 mg to 400 mg should be given. After the loading dose, the daily dose (according to indication) should be based on the following summary:\n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 Creatinine\n                              \n                              \n                                 Clearance\n                                 (mL/min)\n                              \n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 Recommended\n                              \n                              \n                                 Dose (\n                                 %)\n                              \n                              \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           >50 \n     \n                           \n                           100 \n     \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \u226450 (no dialysis) \n     \n                           \n                           50 \n     \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           Hemodialysis \n     \n                           \n                           100% after each hemodialysis \n     \n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Patients on hemodialysis should receive 100% of the recommended dose after each hemodialysis; on non-dialysis days, patients should receive a reduced dose according to their creatinine clearance.\n                  These are suggested dose adjustments based on pharmacokinetics following administration of multiple doses.
