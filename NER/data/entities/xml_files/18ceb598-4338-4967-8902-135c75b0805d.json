    "contraindications_original": "Only persons trained in the administration of general anesthesia should administer SUPRANE. Only a vaporizer specifically designed and designated for use with desflurane should be utilized for its administration. Facilities for maintenance of a patent airway, artificial ventilation, oxygen enrichment, and circulatory resuscitation must be immediately available.\n                  SUPRANE is administered by inhalation. The administration of general anesthesia must be individualized based on the patient\u2019s response. Hypotension and respiratory depression increase as anesthesia with SUPRANE is deepened. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of SUPRANE decreases with increasing patient age. The MAC for SUPRANE is also reduced by concomitant N2O administration (see Table 1\n                     ). The dose should be adjusted accordingly. The following table provides mean relative potency based upon age and effect of N2O in predominately ASA physical status I or II patients.\n                  Benzodiazepines and opioids decrease the MAC of SUPRANE [See Drug Interactions (7.1, Table 3)\n                     ]. SUPRANE also decreases the doses of neuromuscular blocking agents required [See Drug Interactions (7.2, Table 4)\n                     ]. The dose should be adjusted accordingly.\n                  \n                     Table 1\n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n
