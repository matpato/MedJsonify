( 2.1 ) \u2022 Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2.1 , 5 ) \u2022 Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

( 2.1 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)]. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2.1 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Initial Dosage: - Intramuscular or Subcutaneous Use: The usual starting dose is 1 mg to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours as necessary. ( 2.2 ) - Intravenous Use: The usual starting dose is 0.2 mg to 1 mg every 2 to 3 hours. The injection should be given slowly, over at least 2 to 3 minutes. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection [high potency formulation (HPF)] is for opioid-tolerant patients only and should be used only if the amount of hydromorphone required can be delivered accurately with this formulation.

( 2.3 ) \u2022 Renal Impairment: Initiate treatment with one-fourth to one-half the usual starting dose, depending on degree of renal impairment.
