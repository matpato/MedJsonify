The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mg. In acute flares of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, it may be necessary to increase the dosage by 25 mg or, if required, by 50 mg daily.\n                  If minor adverse effects develop as the dosage is increased, reduce the dosage rapidly to a tolerated\u00a0dose and OBSERVE THE PATIENT CLOSELY.\n                  If severe adverse reactions occur, STOP THE DRUG.
