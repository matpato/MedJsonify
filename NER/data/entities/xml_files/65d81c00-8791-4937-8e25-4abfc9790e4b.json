A total daily dose of greater than 30 mcg (15 mcg twice daily) is not recommended.\n                  Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should be administered by the orally inhaled route via a standard jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor (see the accompanying Patient Information). Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should not be swallowed.\n                  Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution should be stored refrigerated in foil pouches. An opened unit-dose vial should be used right away.\n                  If the recommended maintenance treatment regimen fails to provide the usual response, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of destabilization of COPD. Under these circumstances, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated and additional therapeutic options should be considered.\n                  No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. However, since the clearance of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution is prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment, they should be monitored closely.\n                  The drug compatibility (physical and chemical), efficacy, and safety of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established.\n                  The safety and efficacy of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution have been established in clinical trials when administered using the PARI LC\u00ae Plus nebulizer (with a face mask or mouthpiece) and the PARI DURA NEB\u2122 3000 compressor.
