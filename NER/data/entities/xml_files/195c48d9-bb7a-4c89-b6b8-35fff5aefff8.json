Not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use.\n                  Apply DERMOTIC OIL into the affected ear using the supplied ear dropper. To apply, tilt head to one side so that the ear is facing up. Then gently pull the ear lobe backward and upward and apply 5 drops of DERMOTIC OIL into the ear. Keep head tilted for about a minute to allow DERMOTIC OIL to penetrate lower into the ear canal. Gently pat excess material dripping out of the ear using a clean cotton ball. Follow these instructions twice each day for 7 to 14 days.\n                  Discontinue DERMOTIC OIL when control of disease is achieved within 2 weeks, or contact the healthcare provider if no improvement is seen within 2 weeks.\n                  Do not use on the face, axillae, or groin unless directed by the healthcare provider. Do not apply to intertriginous areas due to the increased risk of local adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].",
