Tolmetin Sodium tablets are indicated in the treatment of acute flares and the long-term management of the chronic disease.\n                  Tolmetin Sodium tablets are also indicated for treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The safety and effectiveness of Tolmetin Sodium tablets have not been established in pediatric patients under 2 years of age (see\n \n  PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Useand\n \n  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).",
    "contraindications_original": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of TOLMETIN SODIUM and other treatment options before deciding to use Tolmetin Sodium. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see\n \n  WARNINGS).\n\n \n                  After observing the response to initial therapy with Tolmetin Sodium, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient\u2019s needs.\n                  For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, the recommended starting dose for adults is 400 mg three times daily (1200 mg daily), preferably including a dose on arising and a dose at bedtime. To achieve optimal therapeutic effect the dose should be adjusted according to the patient\u2019s response after 1 or 2 weeks. Control is usually achieved at doses of 600 mg to 1800 mg daily in divided doses (generally t.i.d.). Doses larger than 1800 mg/day have not been studied and are not recommended.\n                  For the relief of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting dose for pediatric patients (2 years and older) is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses (t.i.d. or q.i.d.). When control has been achieved, the usual dose ranges from 15 to 30 mg/kg/day. Doses higher than 30 mg/kg/day have not been studied, and, therefore, are not recommended.\n                  A therapeutic response to Tolmetin Sodium can be expected in a few days to a week. Progressive improvement can be anticipated during succeeding weeks of therapy. If gastrointestinal symptoms occur, Tolmetin Sodium can be administered with antacids other than sodium bicarbonate. Tolmetin Sodium bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are not significantly affected by acute or chronic administration of magnesium and aluminum hydroxides; however, bioavailability is affected by food or milk (see\n \n  PRECAUTIONS: Drug-Food Interaction).",
