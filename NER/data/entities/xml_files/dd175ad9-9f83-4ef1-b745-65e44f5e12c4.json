    "indications_original": "The injectable form of methocarbamol is indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Methocarbamol does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man.",
    "contraindications_original": "For Intravenous and Intramuscular Use Only. Total adult dosage should not exceed 30 mL (3 vials) a day for more than 3 consecutive days except in the treatment of tetanus. If the condition persists, a like course may be repeated after a drug-free interval of 48 hours. Dosage and frequency of injection should be based on the severity of the condition being treated and therapeutic response noted. \n                  For the relief of symptoms of moderate degree, one dose of 1 gram (one 10 mL vial) may be adequate. Ordinarily this injection need not be repeated, as the administration of the oral form will usually sustain the relief initiated by the injection. For the severest cases or in postoperative conditions in which oral administration is not feasible, additional doses of 1 gram may be repeated every 8 hours up to a maximum of 3 g/day for no more than 3 consecutive days.",

    "adverseReactions_original": "Methocarbamol injection should not be administered to patients with known or suspected renal pathology. This caution is necessary because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 300 in the vehicle.\n                  A much larger amount of polyethylene glycol 300 than is present in recommended doses of Methocarbamol injection is known to have increased pre-existing acidosis and urea retention in patients with renal impairment. Although the amount present in this preparation is well within the limits of safety, caution dictates this contraindication. \n                  Methocarbamol injection is contraindicated in patients hypersensitive to methocarbamol or to any of the injection components.",
