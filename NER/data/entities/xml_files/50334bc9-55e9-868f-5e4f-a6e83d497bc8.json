    "indications_original": "Carboprost tromethamine injection, USP is indicated for aborting pregnancy between the 13th and 20th weeks of gestation as calculated from the first day of the last normal menstrual period and in the following conditions related to second trimester abortion:\n                  1. Failure of expulsion of the fetus during the course of treatment by another method;\n                  2. Premature rupture of membranes in intrauterine methods with loss of drug\u00a0and insufficient or absent uterine\u00a0activity;\n                  3. Requirement of a repeat intrauterine instillation of drug for expulsion of the\u00a0fetus;\n                  4. Inadvertent or spontaneous rupture of membranes in the presence of a previable fetus and absence of adequate activity for\u00a0expulsion.\n                  Carboprost tromethamine injection is indicated for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony which has not responded to conventional methods of management. Prior treatment should include the use of intravenously administered oxytocin, manipulative techniques such as uterine massage and, unless contraindicated, intramuscular ergot preparations. \n                   Studies have shown that in such cases, the use of carboprost tromethamine injection has resulted in satisfactory control of hemorrhage, although it is unclear whether or not ongoing or delayed effects of previously administered ecbolic agents have contributed to the outcome. In a high proportion of cases, carboprost tromethamine injection used in this manner has resulted in the cessation of life threatening bleeding and the avoidance of emergency surgical intervention.",
    "contraindications_original": "An initial dose of 1 mL of carboprost tromethamine injection sterile solution (containing the equivalent of 250 micrograms of carboprost) is to be administered deep in the muscle. Subsequent doses of 250 micrograms should be administered at 1\u00bd to 3\u00bd hour intervals depending on uterine response. \u00a0 \n                         An optional test dose of 100 micrograms (0.4 mL) may be administered initially. The dose may be increased to 500 micrograms (2 mL) if uterine contractility is judged to be inadequate after several doses of 250 micrograms (1 mL). \u00a0 \n                         The total dose administered of carboprost tromethamine should not exceed 12 milligrams and continuous administration of the drug for more than two days is not recommended.",

Carboprost tromethamine injection should be used by medically trained personnel in a hospital which can provide immediate intensive care and acute surgical facilities\n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Carboprost tromethamine does not appear to directly affect the fetoplacental unit. Therefore, the possibility does exist that the previable fetus aborted by carboprost tromethamine could exhibit transient life signs. Carboprost tromethamine is not indicated if the fetus in utero has reached the stage of viability. Carboprost tromethamine injection should not be considered a feticidal agent.\n                   Evidence from animal studies has suggested that certain other prostaglandins have some teratogenic potential. Although these studies do not indicate that carboprost tromethamine injection is teratogenic, any pregnancy termination with carboprost tromethamine injection that fails should be completed by some other means. \u00a0 \n                   This product contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol has been reported to be associated with a fatal \"Gasping Syndrome\" in premature infants."
