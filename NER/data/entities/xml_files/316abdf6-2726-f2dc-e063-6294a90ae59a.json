For patients with TG less than 400 mg\n \n  /dL (<4.5 mmol\n \n  /L), LDL-C can be estimated using the following equation:\n\n \n                  LDL-C = total-C \u2013 [0.2 \u00d7 (TG) + HDL-C]\n                  For TG levels >400 mg/dL (>4.5 mmol/L), this equation is less accurate and LDL-C concentrations should be determined by ultracentrifugation. In hypertriglyceridemic patients, LDL-C may be low or normal despite elevated total-C. In such cases, lovastatin tablets USP are not indicated.\n                  The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Treatment Guidelines are summarized below:\n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 \u2020CHD, coronary heart disease \n      \n                              \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 \u2020\n                                 \u2020Some authorities recommend use of LDL-lowering drugs in this category if an LDL-C level of <100 mg/dL cannot be achieved by therapeutic lifestyle changes.

LDL-C goal has been achieved, if the TG is still \u2265200 mg/dL, non-HDL-C (total-C minus HDL-C) becomes a secondary target of therapy. Non-HDL-C goals are set 30 mg/dL higher than LDL-C goals for each risk category.\n                  At the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, consideration can be given to initiating drug therapy at discharge if the LDL-C is \u2265130 mg/dL (see NCEP Guidelines above).\n                  Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the NCEP recommends that LDL-C levels be used to initiate and assess treatment response.
