    "contraindications_original": "Amphetamines should be administered at the lowest effective dosage and dosage should be individually adjusted. Late evening doses should be avoided because of the resulting insomnia.\n                  \n                     Narcolepsy: Usual dose is 5 mg to 60 mg per day in divided doses, depending on the individual patient response.\n                  Narcolepsy seldom occurs in children under 12 years of age; however, when it does, dextroamphetamine sulfate oral solution may be used. The suggested initial dose for patients aged 6 to 12 is 5 mg daily; daily dose may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained. In patients 12 years of age and older, start with 10 mg daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 10 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained. If bothersome adverse reactions appear (e.g., insomnia or anorexia), dosage should be reduced. Give first dose on awakening; additional doses (1 or 2) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours.\n                  \n                     Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity: Not recommended for pediatric patients under 3 years of age.\n                  \n                     In pediatric patients from 3 to 5 years of age, start with 2.5 mg daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 2.5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained.\n                  \n                     In pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, start with 5 mg once or twice daily; daily dosage may be raised in increments of 5 mg at weekly intervals until optimal response is obtained. Only in rare cases will it be necessary to exceed a total of 40 mg per day.\n                  Give first dose on awakening; additional doses (1 or 2) at intervals of 4 to 6 hours.\n                  Where possible, drug administration should be interrupted occasionally to determine if there is a recurrence of behavioral symptoms sufficient to require continued therapy.\n                  Prior to treating patients with dextroamphetamine sulfate assess:\n                  \n                     for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) (see WARNINGS).\n                     the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette\u2019s syndrome (see WARNINGS).",
