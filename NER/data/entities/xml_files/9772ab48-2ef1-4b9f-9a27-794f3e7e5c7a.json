The rate of the maintenance infusion may be increased to achieve effective arrhythmia suppression. \n                  In the event of breakthrough episodes of VF or hemodynamically unstable VT, use 150 mg supplemental infusions of amiodarone (mixed in 100 mL of D5W and infused over 10 minutes to minimize the potential for hypotension). \n                  The first 24-hour dose may be individualized for each patient; however, in controlled clinical trials, mean daily doses above 2100 mg were associated with an increased risk of hypotension. Do not exceed an initial infusion rate of 30 mg/min. \n                  Based on the experience from clinical studies of intravenous amiodarone, a maintenance infusion of up to 0.5 mg/min can be continued for 2 to 3 weeks regardless of the patient's age, renal function, or left ventricular function. There has been limited experience in patients receiving intravenous amiodarone for longer than 3 weeks. \n                  The surface properties of solutions containing injectable amiodarone are altered such that the drop size may be reduced. This reduction may lead to underdosage of the patient by up to 30% if drop counter infusion sets are used. Amiodarone must be delivered by a volumetric infusion pump. \n                  Administer amiodarone, whenever possible, through a central venous catheter dedicated to that purpose. Use an in-line filter during administration. \n                  Intravenous amiodarone loading infusions at much higher concentrations and rates of infusion much faster than recommended have resulted in hepatocellular necrosis and acute renal failure, leading to death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. \n                  Intravenous amiodarone concentrations greater than 3 mg/mL in D5W have been associated with a high incidence of peripheral vein phlebitis; however, concentrations of 2.5 mg/mL or less appear to be less irritating. Therefore, for infusions longer than 1 hour, do not exceed amiodarone concentrations of 2 mg/mL, unless a central venous catheter is used [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].\n                  \n                  Amiodarone infusions exceeding 2 hours must be administered in glass or polyolefin bottles containing D5W. Do not use evacuated glass containers for admixing, as incompatibility with a buffer in the container may cause precipitation. \n                  Amiodarone adsorbs to polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing, but all of the clinical experience has been with PVC tubing and the concentrations and rates of infusion provided in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION reflect dosing in these studies. \n                  Amiodarone has been found to leach out plasticizers, including DEHP [di-(2- ethylhexyl)phthalate] from intravenous tubing (including PVC tubing). The degree of leaching increases when infusing amiodarone at higher concentrations and lower flow rates than provided in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. Polysorbate 80, a component of amiodarone injection, is also known to leach DEHP from PVC [see Description (11)]. \n                  Amiodarone does not need to be protected from light during administration. \n                  NOTE: Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit \u2013 solution should be clear. \n                  CAUTION: Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before the administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. \n                  \n                     Table 2: AMIODARONE HCl SOLUTION STABILITY \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 Solution\n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 Concentration (mg/mL)\n                                 \n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 Container\n                              \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 Comments\n                              \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              \n                                 5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 1.0 \u2013 6.0 \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 PVC \n                           \n                           \n                              \n                                 Physically compatible, with amiodarone loss <10% at 2 hours at room temperature. \n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              5% Dextrose in Water (D5W) \n                           \n                           \n                              1.0 \u2013 6.0 \n                           \n                           \n                              Polyolefin, Glass \n                           \n                           \n                              Physically compatible, with no amiodarone loss at 24 hours at room temperature.",
