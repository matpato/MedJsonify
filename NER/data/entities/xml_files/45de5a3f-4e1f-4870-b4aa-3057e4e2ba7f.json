    "adverseReactions_original": "Voriconazole tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to voriconazole or its excipients. There is no information regarding cross-sensitivity between voriconazole and other azole antifungal agents. Caution should be used when prescribing voriconazole tablets to patients with hypersensitivity to other azoles.\n                     Coadministration of\u00a0pimozide, quinidine\u00a0or ivabradine with voriconazole tablets is contraindicated because increased plasma concentrations of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade de pointes \n                        [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with sirolimus is contraindicated because voriconazole tablets significantly increases sirolimus concentrations [see\u00a0Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with rifampin, carbamazepine, long-acting barbiturates, and St John\u2019s Wort is contraindicated because these drugs are likely to decrease plasma voriconazole concentrations significantly [see\u00a0Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n                     Coadministration of standard doses of voriconazole with efavirenz doses of 400 mg every 24 hours or higher is contraindicated, because efavirenz significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations in healthy subjects at these doses. Voriconazole also significantly increases efavirenz plasma concentrations [see\u00a0Drug Interactions (7) and \n                        \n                           Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with high-dose ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) is contraindicated because ritonavir (400 mg every 12 hours) significantly decreases plasma voriconazole concentrations.\u00a0 Coadministration of voriconazole and low-dose ritonavir (100 mg every 12 hours) should be avoided, unless an assessment of the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole [see\u00a0Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with rifabutin is contraindicated since voriconazole tablets significantly increases rifabutin plasma concentrations and rifabutin also significantly decreases voriconazole plasma concentrations [see\u00a0Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with ergot alkaloids (ergotamine and dihydroergotamine) is contraindicated because voriconazole tablets may increase the plasma concentration of ergot alkaloids, which may lead to ergotism [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with naloxegol is contraindicated because voriconazole tablets may increase plasma concentrations of naloxegol which may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n                     \n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with tolvaptan is contraindicated because voriconazole tablets may increase tolvaptan plasma concentrations and increase risk of adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n                     \n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with venetoclax at initiation and during the ramp-up phase is contraindicated in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) due to the potential for increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n                     \n                     Coadministration of voriconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in significant increases in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions [see Drug Interactions (7)].",
