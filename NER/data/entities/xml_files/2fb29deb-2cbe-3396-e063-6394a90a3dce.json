    "contraindications_original": "(SEE TABLE BELOW)\n                  \n                  Carbamazepine suspension in combination with liquid chlorpromazine or thioridazine results in precipitate formation, and, in the case of chlorpromazine, there has been a report of a patient passing an orange rubbery precipitate in the stool following coadministration of the two drugs (see\n \n  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Because the extent to which this occurs with other liquid medications is not known, carbamazepine suspension should not be administered simultaneously with other liquid medications or diluents.\n\n \n                  Monitoring of blood levels has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants (see\n \n  PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests). Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient. A low initial daily dosage with a gradual increase is advised. As soon as adequate control is achieved, the dosage may be reduced very gradually to the minimum effective level. Medication should be taken with meals.\n\n \n                  Since a given dose of carbamazepine suspension will produce higher peak levels than the same dose given as the tablet, it is recommended to start with low doses (children 6 to 12 years: \u00bd teaspoon (four times a day) and to increase slowly to avoid unwanted side effects.\n                  Conversion of patients from oral carbamazepine tablets to carbamazepine suspension: Patients should be converted by administering the same number of mg per day in smaller, more frequent doses (i.e., twice a day tablets to three times a day suspension).\n                  Carbamazepine extended-release tablets is an extended-release formulation for twice-a-day administration. When converting patients from carbamazepine conventional tablets to carbamazepine extended-release tablets, the same total daily mg dose of carbamazepine extended-release tablets should be administered.\n \n  Carbamazepine extended-release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed.Carbamazepine extended-release tablets should be inspected for chips or cracks. Damaged tablets should not be consumed.",
