The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for\u00a0two to three days before beginning therapy with enalapril maleate to\u00a0reduce the likelihood of hypotension (see\n \n  WARNINGS, Hypotension).\u00a0If the patients blood pressure is not controlled with enalapril maleate\u00a0alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed.\u00a0\n\n \n                  If the diuretic cannot be discontinued an initial dose of 2.5 mg should be\u00a0used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood\u00a0pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see\n \n  WARNINGS,\u00a0Hypotensionand\n \n  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).\n\n \n                  \n                       The recommended initial dose in patients not on diuretics is 5 mg\u00a0once a day.
