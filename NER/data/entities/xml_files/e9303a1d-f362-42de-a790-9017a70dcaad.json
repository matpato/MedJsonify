    "contraindications_original": "Pre-Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion ( 2.1 ): Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion. \u2022 If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately. o Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment. \u2022 If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained (or is unavailable or uninterpretable) within the 8-hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours. \u2022 If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known: o Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine immediately o Obtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment \u2022 If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known: o Use the revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram ( Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine ( 2.2 ) Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.2 ): See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing. Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2.3 ): Acetylcysteine is hyperosmolar (2600 mOsmol/L), therefore acetylcysteine must be diluted in the recommended volume of sterile water for injection, 0.45% sodium chloride injection, or 5% dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration. In general, 0.45% normal saline is the preferred diluent because it provides a more consistent osmolarity profile, reduces the amount of free water delivered to the patient, and better approximates physiologic fluids. See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and acetylcysteine concentration. Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosage ( 2.5 ): \u2022 Acetylcysteine is for intravenous administration only \u2022 Total dosage of acetylcysteine is 300 mg/kg given intravenously as 3 separate doses and total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for weight-based dosage and weight-based dilution ( 2.5 ) \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine treatment after 21 hours ( 2.2 ) Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2.6 ): \u2022 Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment; revised Rumack-Matthew nomogram does not apply.",
