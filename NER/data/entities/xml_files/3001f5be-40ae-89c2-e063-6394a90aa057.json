Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.\n                  In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute delirium tremens and hallucinosis.\n                  As an adjunct prior to endoscopic procedures if apprehension, anxiety or acute stress reactions are present, and to diminish the patient's recall of the procedures\u00a0(See\n \n  \n                        WARNINGS\n                     ).\n\n \n                  Diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma); spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia); athetosis; stiff-man syndrome; and tetanus.\n                  Diazepam injection is a useful adjunct in status epilepticus.\n                  Diazepam is a useful premedication (the intramuscular route is preferred) for relief of anxiety and tension in patients who are to undergo surgical procedures.

    "contraindications_original": "Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. The usual recommended dose in older children and adults ranges from 2 mg to 20 mg intramuscular or intravenous, depending on the indication and its severity. In some conditions, e.g., tetanus, larger doses may be required. (See dosage for specific indications.) In acute conditions the injection may be repeated within one hour although an interval of 3 to 4 hours is usually satisfactory. Lower doses (usually 2 mg to 5 mg) and slow increase in dosage should be used for elderly or debilitated patients and when other sedative drugs are administered.(See\n \n  \n                        WARNINGS\n                     and\n \n  \n                        ADVERSE REACTIONS\n                     ).\n\n \n                  For dosage in infants above the age of 30 days and children, see the specific indications below. When intravenous use is indicated, facilities for respiratory assistance should be readily available. \n  \n                     Intramuscular:Diazepam injection should be injected deeply into the muscle. \n  \n                     Intravenous Use:For the treatment of status epilepticus in children, the solution should be injected slowly, taking one minute for administration (See\n \n  \n                        WARNINGS\n                     , particularly for use in children).\u00a0For other indications, the solution should be injected slowly taking at least one minute for each 5 mg (1 mL) given. Do not use small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist. Extreme care should be taken to avoid intra-arterial administration or extravasation. \n    Do not mix or dilute diazepam with other solutions or drugs in syringe or infusion container.
