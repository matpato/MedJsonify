The maximum dose is 200 mg per day.\n                  Treatment with Fenofibrate Capsules should be initiated at a dose of 67 mg/day in patients having impaired renal function, and increased only after evaluation of the effects on renal function and lipid levels at this dose. In the elderly, the initial dose should likewise be limited to 67 mg/day.\n                  Lipid levels should be monitored periodically and consideration should be given to reducing the dosage of Fenofibrate Capsules if lipid levels fall significantly below the targeted range.",
