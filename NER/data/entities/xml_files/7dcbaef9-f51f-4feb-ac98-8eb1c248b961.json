( 2.1 ) Recommended starting dose: 2 mg by mouth every 6 to 8 hours, as needed, up to a maximum of 3 doses in 24 hours. ( 2.2 ) Dosage can be increased by 2 mg to 4 mg per dose every 1 to 4 days; maximum total daily dosage is 36 mg. ( 2.2 ) The pharmacokinetics of Ontralfy differ when taken with or without food. These differences could result in a change in tolerability and control of symptoms. Consistent administration with respect to food is recommended. ( 2.2 , 12.3 ) Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance <25 mL/min) or hepatic impairment: use lower individual doses during titration. If higher doses are required, individual doses rather than dosing frequency should be increased.
