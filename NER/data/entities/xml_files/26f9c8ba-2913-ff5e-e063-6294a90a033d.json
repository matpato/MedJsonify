Dosage of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP in adults is 2000 mg.\n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                  Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP should generally be given once daily with the evening meal.
