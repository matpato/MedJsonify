    "contraindications_original": "The dose of phenobarbital must be individualized with full knowledge of its particular characteristics. Factors of consideration are the patient\u2019s age, weight, and condition.\n                  \n                     Sedation:\n                  \n                  For sedation, the drug may be administered in single dose of 30 to 120 mg repeated at intervals: frequency will be determined by the patient\u2019s response. It is generally considered that no more than 400 mg of phenobarbital should be administered during a 24-hour period.\n                  \n                     Adults:\n                  \n                  Daytime Sedation: 30 to 120 mg daily in 2 to 3 divided doses.\n                  Oral Hypnotic: 100 to 200 mg.\n                  \n                     Anticonvulsant Use \u2013 Clinical laboratory reference values should be used to determine the therapeutic anticonvulsant level of phenobarbital in the serum. To achieve the blood levels considered therapeutic in pediatric patients, higher per-kilogram dosages are generally necessary for phenobarbital and most other anticonvulsants. In children and infants, phenobarbital at a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg produces blood levels of about 20 mcg/mL shortly after administration.\n      \n\n \n      \n\n \n      \n\n \n                  Phenobarbital has been used in the treatment and prophylaxis of febrile seizures. However, it has not been established that prevention of febrile seizures influences the subsequent development of epilepsy.\n                  Adults: 60 to 200 mg/day.\n                  Pediatric Patients: 3 to 6 mg/kg/day.\n                  \n                     Special Patient Population \u2013 Dosage should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated because these patients may be more sensitive to barbiturates. Dosage should be reduced for patients with impaired renal function or hepatic disease.",
