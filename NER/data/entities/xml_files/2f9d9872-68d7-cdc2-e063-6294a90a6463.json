    "contraindications_original": "For Oral Administration\n                  \n                  The initial dosage varies from 0.75 mg to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated.\n                  \n                     It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on The Basis of The Disease Under Treatment and The Response of The Patient.\n                  \n                  After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached.\n                  Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.\n                  In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 mg to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see\n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS,\u00a0\n \n  \n                     \n                        \n                           Neuro-psychiatric\n                        \n                     ).\n\n \n                  In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated.
