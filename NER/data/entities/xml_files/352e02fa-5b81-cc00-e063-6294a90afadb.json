    "contraindications_original": "Apply clonidine transdermal system once every 7 days to a hairless area of intact skin on the upper outer arm or chest. Each new application of clonidine transdermal system should be on a different skin site from the previous location. If the system loosens during 7 day wearing, the adhesive cover should be applied directly over the system to ensure good adhesion. There have been rare reports of the need for patch changes prior to 7 days to maintain blood pressure control.\n                  To initiate therapy, clonidine transdermal system dosage should be titrated according to individual therapeutic requirements, starting with clonidine transdermal system 0.1 mg. If after one or two weeks the desired reduction in blood pressure is not achieved, increase the dosage by adding another clonidine transdermal system 0.1 mg or changing to a larger system. An increase in dosage above two clonidine transdermal system 0.3 mg is usually not associated with additional efficacy.\n                  When substituting clonidine transdermal system for oral clonidine or for other antihypertensive drugs, physicians should be aware that the antihypertensive effect of clonidine transdermal system may not commence until 2 to 3 days after initial application. Therefore, gradual reduction of prior drug dosage is advised. Some or all previous antihypertensive treatment may have to be continued, particularly in patients with more severe forms of hypertension.",
