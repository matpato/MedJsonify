Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use a graduated oral syringe or measuring cup, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication.\n                        Inform patients and caregivers that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen oral solution.\n                        Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.\n                        Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see \n                              WARNINGS\n                           ].

Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.\n                        There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see \n                              WARNINGS\n                           ].\n                        Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Oral Solution.
