    "indications_original": "Ultramicrosize griseofulvin  tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following ringworm infections; tinea corporis (ringworm of the body), tinea pedis (athlete\u2019s foot), tinea cruris (ringworm of the groin and thigh), tinea barbae (barber\u2019s itch), tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp), and tinea unguium (onychomycosis, ringworm of the nails), when caused by one or more of the following genera of fungi: Trichophyton\u00a0rubrum, Trichophyton\u00a0tonsurans, Trichophyton\u00a0mentagrophytes, Trichophyton\u00a0 interdigitalis, Trichophyton\u00a0 verrucosum, Trichophyton\u00a0 megnini, Trichophyton\u00a0 gallinae, Trichophyton\u00a0 crateriform, Trichophyton\u00a0 sulphureum, Trichophyton\u00a0 schoenleini, Microsporum\u00a0 audouini, Microsporum\u00a0 canis, Microsporum\u00a0 gypseum and Epidermophyton\u00a0 floccosum. NOTE: Prior to therapy, the type of fungi responsible for the infection should be identified. The use of the drug is not justified in minor or trivial infections which will respond to topical agents alone. Griseofulvin is not effective in the following: bacterial infections, candidiasis (moniliasis), histoplasmosis, actinomycosis, sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, North American blastomycosis, cryptococcosis (torulosis), tinea versicolor and nocardiosis.",
    "contraindications_original": "Accurate diagnosis of infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium. Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium-depending on rate of growth-fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months. \n                  General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of athlete\u2019s foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as fungi. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection. \n                  Ultramicrosize griseofulvin  tablets may be swallowed whole or crushed and sprinkled onto 1 tablespoonful of applesauce and swallowed immediately without chewing. \n                  \n                     Adults: Daily administration of 375 mg (as a single dose or in divided doses) will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis. For those fungal infections more difficult to eradicate, such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a divided dose of 750 mg is recommended. \n                  \n                     Pediatric Use: Approximately 7.3 mg per kg of body weight per day of ultramicrosize griseofulvin is an effective dose for most pediatric patients. On this basis, the following dosage schedule is suggested: \n                  16 to 27 kg: 125 mg to 187.5 mg daily.\n                  Over 27 kg: 187.5 mg to 375 mg daily\n                  Children and infants 2 years of age and younger \u2013 dosage has not been established. Clinical experience with griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis indicates that a single daily dose is effective. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.",

    "adverseReactions_original": "Two cases of conjoined twins have been reported since 1977 in patients taking griseofulvin during the first trimester of pregnancy. Griseofulvin should not be prescribed to pregnant patients. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. This drug is contraindicated in patients with porphyria or hepatocellular failure and in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to griseofulvin."
