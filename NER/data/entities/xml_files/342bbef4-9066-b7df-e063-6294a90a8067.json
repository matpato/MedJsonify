    "indications_original": "Phendimetrazine tartrate is indicated in the management of exogenous obesity as a short term adjunct (a few weeks) in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction in patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m\n \n  2or higher who have not responded to appropriate weight reducing regimen (diet and/or exercise) alone. Below is a chart of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on various heights and weights. BMI is calculated by taking the patient\u2019s weight, in kilograms (kg), divided by the patient\u2019s height, in meters (m), squared. Metric conversions are as follows: pounds \u00f7 2.2 = kg; inches x 0.0254 = meters.\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                  \n                  \n                  Phendimetrazine tartrate is indicated for use as monotherapy only.",
