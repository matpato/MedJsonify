Do not use propafenone hydrochloride tablets to      control ventricular rate during AF.\n                     Some      patients with atrial flutter treated with propafenone have developed 1:1      conduction, producing an increase in ventricular rate. Concomitant      treatment with drugs that increase the functional atrioventricular (AV)      nodal refractory period is recommended.\n                     The      use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets in patients with chronic atrial      fibrillation has not been evaluated.\n                     Because      of the proarrhythmic effects of\u00a0 propafenone hydrochloride tablets, its use      with lesser ventricular arrhythmias is not recommended, even if patients      are symptomatic, and any use of the drug should be reserved for patients      in whom, in the opinion of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh      the risks.\n                     The      effect of propafenone on mortality has not been determined [see Boxed Warning] .",
    "contraindications_original": "The dose of propafenone hydrochloride tablets must be individually titrated on the basis of response and tolerance. Initiate therapy with propafenone hydrochloride tablets 150 mg given every 8 hours (450 mg/day). Dosage may be increased at a minimum of 3 to 4 day intervals to 225 mg every 8 hours (675 mg/day). If additional therapeutic effect is needed, the dose of propafenone hydrochloride tablets may be increased to 300 mg every 8 hours (900 mg/day). The usefulness and safety of dosages exceeding 900 mg per day have not been established.\n                  In patients with hepatic impairment or those with significant widening of the QRS complex or second- or third-degree AV block, consider reducing the dose.\n                  As with other antiarrhythmic agents, in the elderly or in ventricular arrhythmia patients with marked previous myocardial damage, the dose of propafenone hydrochloride tablets should be increased more gradually during the initial phase of treatment.\n                  The combination of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibition and either cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with the simultaneous administration of propafenone may significantly increase the concentration of propafenone and thereby increase the risk of proarrhythmia and other adverse events. Therefore, avoid simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride tablets with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].",
