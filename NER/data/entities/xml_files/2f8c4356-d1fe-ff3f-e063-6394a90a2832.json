    "indications_original": "Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.",
    "contraindications_original": "Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution is available in concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5%. The usual starting dose is one drop of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic 0.25% Solution in the affected eye(s) twice a day. If the clinical response is not adequate, the dosage may be changed to one drop of 0.5% solution in the affected eye(s) twice a day.\n                  Since in some patients the pressure-lowering response to Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution may require a few weeks to stabilize, evaluation should include a determination of intraocular pressure after approximately 4 weeks of treatment with Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution.\n                  If the intraocular pressure is maintained at satisfactory levels, the dosage schedule may be changed to one drop once a day in the affected eye(s). Because of diurnal variations in intraocular pressure, satisfactory response to the once-a-day dose is best determined by measuring the intraocular pressure at different times during the day.\n                  Dosages above one drop of Timolol Maleate Ophthalmic Solution 0.5% twice a day generally have not been shown to produce further reduction in intraocular pressure. If the patient\u2019s intraocular pressure is still not at a satisfactory level on this regimen, concomitant therapy with other agent(s) for lowering intraocular pressure can be instituted. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended [see ].",
