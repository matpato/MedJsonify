Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and beta-lactamase producing organisms susceptible to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should not require the addition of another antibacterial.\n                  Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection.\n                  Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above in the indicated organ systems. Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted if appropriate.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "The pharmacy bulk package is for preparation of solutions for IV infusion only.\n                  Ampicillin and Sulbactam should be administered by slow intravenous injection over at least 10 - 15 minutes or can also be delivered in greater dilutions with 50 - 100 mL of a compatible diluent as an intravenous infusion over 15 - 30 minutes.\n                  The recommended adult dosage of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection is 1.5 g (1 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 0.5 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) to 3 g (2 g ampicillin as the sodium salt plus 1 g sulbactam as the sodium salt) every six hours. This 1.5 to 3 g range represents the total of ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection and corresponds to a range of 1 g ampicillin/0.5 g sulbactam to 2 g ampicillin/1 g sulbactam. The total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day.\n                  \n                     Pediatric Patients 1 Year of Age or Older:The recommended daily dose of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection in pediatric patients is 300 mg per kg of body weight administered via intravenous infusion in equally divided doses every 6 hours. This 300 mg/kg/day dosage represents the total ampicillin content plus the sulbactam content of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection, and corresponds to 200 mg ampicillin/100 mg sulbactam per kg per day. The safety and efficacy of Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection administered via intramuscular injection in pediatric patients have not been established. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations, and the total dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams per day. The course of intravenous therapy should not routinely exceed 14 days. In clinical trials, most children received a course of oral antimicrobials following initial treatment with intravenous Ampicillin and Sulbactam for Injection (see\n \n  CLINICAL STUDIESsection).\n\n \n                  \n                     Impaired Renal Function\n                  \n                  In patients with impairment of renal function the elimination kinetics of ampicillin and sulbactam are similarly affected, hence the ratio of one to the other will remain constant whatever the renal function.

Ampicillin and Sulbactam concentrations between 3 and 45 mg (2 to 30 mg ampicillin/1 to 15 mg sulbactam/mL) are recommended for intravenous use.\n                  The 15 gram bottle may be reconstituted with either 92 mL Sterile Water for Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. The diluent should be added in two separate aliquots in a suitable work area, such as a laminar flow hood. Add 50 mL of solution, shake to dissolve. Then add an additional 42 mL and shake.
