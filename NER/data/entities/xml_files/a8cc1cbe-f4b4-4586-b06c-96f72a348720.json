    "indications_original": "Felodipine extended-release tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of\n       \n \n  hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the\n       \n \n  risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial\n       \n \n  infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of\n       \n \n  antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including\n       \n \n  felodipine.\n       \n \n  Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular\n       \n \n  risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management,\n       \n \n  antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise and limited sodium intake.\n       \n \n  Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure\n       \n \n  goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines,\n       \n \n  such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint\n       \n \n  National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of\n       \n \n  High Blood Pressure (JNC).\n       \n \n  Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes\n       \n \n  and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized\n       \n \n  controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be\n       \n \n  concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic\n       \n \n  property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest\n       \n \n  and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in\n       \n \n  the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular\n       \n \n  mortality also have been seen regularly.\n       \n \n  Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk,\n       \n \n  and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures,\n       \n \n  so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial\n       \n \n  benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across\n       \n \n  populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in\n       \n \n  patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example,\n       \n \n  patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected\n       \n \n  to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.\n       \n \n  Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as\n       \n \n  monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have\n       \n \n  additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure or\n       \n \n  diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.\n       \n \n  Felodipine extended-release tablets, USP may be administered with other\n       \n \n  antihypertensive agents.",
    "contraindications_original": "The recommended starting dose is 5 mg once a day. Depending on the patient's\n       \n \n  response, the dosage can be decreased to 2.5 mg or increased to 10 mg\n       \n \n  once a day. These adjustments should occur generally at intervals of not less\n       \n \n  than 2 weeks. The recommended dosage range is 2.5 mg to 10 mg once\n       \n \n  daily. In clinical trials, doses above 10 mg daily showed an increased blood\n       \n \n  pressure response but a large increase in the rate of peripheral edema and\n       \n \n  other vasodilatory adverse events (see \n       \n \n  ADVERSE REACTIONS). Modification\n       \n \n  of the recommended dosage is usually not required in patients with renal\n       \n \n  impairment.\n       \n \n  Felodipine extended-release tablets should regularly be taken either without\n       \n \n  food or with a light meal (see \n       \n \n  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics\n                     \n                     and Metabolism). Felodipine extended-release tablets should be swallowed\n       \n \n  whole and not crushed or chewed.",
