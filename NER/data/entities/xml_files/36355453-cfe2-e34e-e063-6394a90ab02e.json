    "indications_original": "Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain,\u00a0burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from\u00a0irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection,\u00a0trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds\u00a0or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of\u00a0symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of\u00a0causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief,\u00a0prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be\u00a0instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when\u00a0symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or\u00a0eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is,\u00a0however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to\u00a0relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial\u00a0therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection\u00a0with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there\u00a0is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of\u00a0Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit\u00a0than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days.
