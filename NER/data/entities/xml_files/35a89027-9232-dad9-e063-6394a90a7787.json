    "indications_original": "Labetalol hydrochloride tablets USP are indicated in the management of hypertension. Labetalol hydrochloride tablets USP may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide and loop diuretics.",
    "contraindications_original": "DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended\n \n  initialdosage is 100 mg\n \n  twicedaily whether used alone or added to a diuretic regimen. After 2 or 3 days, using standing blood pressure as an indicator, dosage may be titrated in increments of 100 mg b.i.d.(twice daily) every 2 or 3 days. The usual\n \n  maintenancedosage of labetalol hydrochloride tablets is between 200 mg and 400 mg\n \n  twicedaily.\n\n \n                  Since the full antihypertensive effect of labetalol hydrochloride tablets is usually seen within the first 1 to 3 hours of the initial dose or dose increment, the assurance of a lack of an exaggerated hypotensive response can be clinically established in the office setting. The antihypertensive effects of continued dosing can be measured at subsequent visits, approximately 12 hours after a dose, to determine whether further titration is necessary.\n                  Patients with severe hypertension may require from 1200 mg to 2400 mg per day, with or without thiazide diuretics. Should side effects (principally nausea or dizziness) occur with these doses administered b.i.d.(twice daily), the same total daily dose administered t.i.d. (three times daily) may improve tolerability and facilitate further titration. Titration increments should not exceed 200 mg b.i.d. (twice daily).\n                  When a diuretic is added, an additive antihypertensive effect can be expected. In some cases this may necessitate a labetalol hydrochloride tablet dosage adjustment. As with most antihypertensive drugs, optimal dosages of labetalol hydrochloride tablets are usually lower in patients also receiving a diuretic.\n                  When transferring patients from other antihypertensive drugs, labetalol hydrochloride tablets should be introduced as recommended and the dosage of the existing therapy progressively decreased.\n                  \n                     Elderly Patients\n                  \n                  As in the general patient population, labetalol therapy may be initiated at 100 mg twice daily and titrated upwards in increments of 100 mg b.i.d.(twice daily) as required for control of blood pressure. Since some elderly patients eliminate labetalol more slowly, however, adequate control of blood pressure may be achieved at a lower maintenance dosage compared to the general population. The majority of elderly patients will require between 100 mg and 200 mg b.i.d.(twice daily)",
