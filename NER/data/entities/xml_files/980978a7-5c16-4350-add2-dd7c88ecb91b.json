Cefadroxil is generally effective in the eradication of streptococci from the oropharynx. However, data establishing the efficacy of cefadroxil for the prophylaxis of subsequent rheumatic fever are not available.\n                  \n                     Note: Culture and susceptibility tests should be initiated prior to and during therapy. Renal function studies should be performed when indicated.\n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefadroxil tablets and other antibacterial drugs, cefadroxil tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
