Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated in some other drugs with the ability to cause torsade de pointes-type arrhythmia, a potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs should be tried first. Whether ziprasidone will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known [\n \n  see Warnings and Precautions (\n  \n   5.3)\n \n  ] \n  \n                     \n                     Schizophrenia\n                       \u2022\u00a0Ziprasidone capsules are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults [\n \n  see Clinical Studies (\n  \n   14.1)\n \n  ]. \n  \n                     \n                     Bipolar I Disorder (Acute Mixed or Manic Episodes and Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate)\n                       \u2022\u00a0Ziprasidone capsules are indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder [\n \n  see Clinical Studies (\n  \n   14.2)\n \n  ]. \n    \u2022\u00a0Ziprasidone capsules are indicated as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults [\n \n  see Clinical Studies (\n  \n   14.2)\n \n  ].",
