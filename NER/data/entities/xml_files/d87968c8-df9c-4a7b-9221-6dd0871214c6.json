    "contraindications_original": "MS CONTIN should be prescribed only by healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks. ( 2.1 ) MS CONTIN 100 mg and 200 mg tablets, a single dose greater than 60 mg, or a total daily dose greater than 120 mg, are only for use in patients in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. ( 2.1 ) Patients considered opioid-tolerant are those taking, for one week or longer, at least 60 mg of morphine per day, 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid. ( 2.1 ) Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals. Reserve titration to higher doses of MS CONTIN for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. ( 2 , 5 ) Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with MS CONTIN. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments. ( 2 , 5 ) Discuss availability of naloxone with the patient and caregiver and assess each patient's need for access to naloxone, both when initiating and renewing treatment with MS CONTIN. Consider prescribing naloxone based on the patient's risk factors for overdose. ( 2.2 , 5.1 , 5.2 , 5.3 ) Instruct patients to swallow MS CONTIN tablets intact and not to cut, break, chew, crush, or dissolve MS CONTIN (risk of potentially fatal dose) ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) For opioid-na\u00efve and opioid non-tolerant patients, initiate with 15 mg tablets orally every 8 to 12 hours. ( 2.3 ) Do not abruptly discontinue MS CONTIN in a physically dependent patient because rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide.
