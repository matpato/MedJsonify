    "contraindications_original": "The dose and rate of administration are dependent upon the specific condition of each patient.\n                  \n                     Administer intravenously only with a calibrated infusion device at a slow, controlled rate.  Highest concentrations (400 mEq/L) should be exclusively administered via central intravenous route.  Whenever possible, administration via a central route is recommended for all concentrations of Potassium Chloride Injection for thorough dilution by the blood stream and decreasing the risk of extravasation and to avoid pain and phlebitis associated with peripheral infusion (see WARNINGS).  Correct placement of the catheter should be verified before administration.\n                  Recommended administration rates should not usually exceed 10 mEq per hour or 200 mEq for a 24 hour period if the serum potassium level is greater than 2.5 mEq per liter.\n                  In urgent cases where the serum potassium level is less than 2.0 mEq per liter or where severe hypokalemia is a threat, (serum potassium level less than 2.0 mEq per liter and electrocardiographic changes and/or muscle paralysis) rates up to 40 mEq per hour or 400 mEq over a 24 hour period can be administered very carefully when guided by continuous monitoring of the EKG and frequent serum K+ determinations to avoid hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest.\n                  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration, whenever solution and container permit.  Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact.  Use of a final filter is recommended during administration of all parenteral solutions where possible.\n                  Do not add supplementary medication.",
