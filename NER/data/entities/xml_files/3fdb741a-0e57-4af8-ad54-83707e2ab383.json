    "contraindications_original": "Hypertension: Dosage needs to be adjusted by titration to individual patient needs. When used as monotherapy, usual starting doses are 120 to 240 mg once daily. Maximum antihypertensive effect is usually observed by 14 days of chronic therapy; therefore, dosage adjustments should be scheduled accordingly. The usual dosage range studied in clinical trials was 120 to 540 mg once daily. Current clinical experience with 540 mg dose is limited; however, the dose may be increased to 540 mg once daily. \n                  \n                     Angina: Dosages for the treatment of angina should be adjusted to each patient's needs, starting with a dose of 120 mg to 180 mg once daily. Individual patients may respond to higher doses of up to 540 mg once daily. When necessary, titration should be carried out over 7 to 14 days. \n                  \n                     \n                        Concomitant\u00a0use\u00a0with\u00a0Other\u00a0Cardiovascular\u00a0Agents:\u00a0\n                  \n                  \n                     1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sublingual\u00a0Nitroglycerin\u00a0(NTG): May be taken as required to abort acute anginal attacks during diltiazem hydrochloride therapy. \n                  \n                     2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prophylactic\u00a0Nitrate\u00a0Therapy: Diltiazem hydrochloride may be safely coadministered with short- and long-acting nitrates. \n                  \n                     3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Beta-blockers: (see  and .) \n                  \n                     4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Antihypertensives: Diltiazem hydrochloride has an additive antihypertensive effect when used with other antihypertensive agents. Therefore, the dosage of diltiazem hydrochloride or the concomitant antihypertensives may need to be adjusted when adding one to the other. \n                  Hypertensive or anginal patients who are treated with other formulations of diltiazem can safely be switched to Tiadylt\u00ae ER capsules at the nearest equivalent total daily dose. Subsequent titration to higher or lower doses may, however, be necessary and should be initiated as clinically indicated. \n                  \n                     \n                        Sprinkling\u00a0the\u00a0Capsule\u00a0Contents\u00a0on\u00a0Food:\u00a0\n                  \n                  Tiadylt\u00ae ER (diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release) Capsules may also be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the capsule contents on a spoonful of applesauce. The applesauce should be swallowed immediately without chewing and followed with a glass of cool water to ensure complete swallowing of the capsule contents. The applesauce should not be hot, and it should be soft enough to be swallowed without chewing. Any capsule contents/applesauce mixture should be used immediately and not stored for future use. Subdividing the contents of a Tiadylt\u00ae ER (diltiazem hydrochloride extended-release) Capsules is not recommended.",
