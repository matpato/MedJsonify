    "indications_original": "Clobetasol Propionate Ointment USP, 0.05% is super-high potency corticosteroid formulations indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended, and the total dosage should not exceed 50 g per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Use in pediatric patients under 12 years of age is not recommended. As with other highly active corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control has been achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary.",
