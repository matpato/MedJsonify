A positive Vizamyl scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid neuritic plaques; neuropathological examination has shown this amount of amyloid neuritic plaque is present in patients with AD, but may also be present in patients with other types of neurologic conditions as well as in older people with normal cognition. Vizamyl is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations.\n                  Limitations of Use:\n                  \n                     A positive Vizamyl scan does not establish a diagnosis of AD or other cognitive disorder.\n                     Safety and effectiveness of Vizamyl have not been established for:\n                           Predicting development of dementia or other neurologic condition.\n                           Monitoring responses to therapies.",
