    "indications_original": "Symptomatic Trichomoniasis\n                     . Metronidazole capsules\u00a0375 mg are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures). \n                  \n                  \n                     Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis\n                     . Metronidazole capsules\u00a0375 mg are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite. \n                  \n                  \n                     Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners\n                     . T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole in cases of reinfection. \n                  \n                  \n                     Amebiasis\n                     . Metronidazole capsules\u00a0375 mg are indicated in the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess. \n                  \n                  In amebic liver abscess, metronidazole capsules\u00a0375 mg therapy does not obviate the need for aspiration or drainage of pus. \n                  \n                  \n                     Anaerobic Bacterial Infections\n                     . Metronidazole capsules\u00a0375 mg are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with metronidazole therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of the aerobic infection should be used in addition to metronidazole capsules\u00a0375 mg. \n                  \n                  INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS, including peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and liver abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group (B. fragilis, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus), Clostridium species, Eubacterium species, Peptococcus species, or Peptostreptococcus species. \n                  \n                  SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, or Fusobacterium species. \n                  \n                  GYNECOLOGIC INFECTIONS, including endometritis, endomyometritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, or Fusobacterium species. \n                  \n                  BACTERIAL SEPTICEMIA caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group or Clostridium species. \n                  \n                  BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS (as adjunctive therapy) caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. \n                  \n                  CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) INFECTIONS, including meningitis and brain abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. \n                  \n                  LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS, including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. \n                  ENDOCARDITIS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group. \n                  \n                  To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of metronidazole capsules\u00a0375 mg and other antibacterial drugs, metronidazole capsules\u00a0375 mg should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",
    "contraindications_original": "Trichomoniasis \u00a0\n                  In the Female: Seven-day course of treatment (375 mg two times daily for seven consecutive days). \n                  \n                  A seven-day course of treatment may minimize reinfection by protecting the patient long enough for the sexual contacts to obtain treatment. Pregnant patients should not be treated during the first trimester (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS). \n                  \n                  When repeat courses of the drug are required, it is recommended that an interval of four to six weeks elapse between courses and that the presence of the trichomonad be reconfirmed by appropriate laboratory measures. Total and differential leukocyte counts should be made before and after re-treatment. \n                  \n                  In the Male: Treatment should be individualized as it is for the female. \n                  \n                     Amebiasis: \u00a0\n                  Adults: \n                  \n                     For acute intestinal amebiasis (acute amebic dysentery): 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days. \n                  \n                  \n                     For amebic liver abscess: 750 mg orally three times daily for 5 to 10 days. \n                  \n                  \n                     Pediatric patients: 35 to 50 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into three doses, orally for 10 days. \n                  \n                     \u00a0\n                  \n                  \n                     Anaerobic Bacterial Infections \u00a0\n                  In the treatment of most serious anaerobic infections, intravenous metronidazole is usually administered initially. \n                  \n                  The usual adult oral dosage is 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours (approximately 500 mg for a 70 kg adult). A maximum of 4 g should not be exceeded during a 24-hour period. \n                  \n                  The usual duration of therapy is 7 to 10 days; however, infections of the bone and joint, lower respiratory tract, and endocardium may require longer treatment.\n                  \n                  \n                     Dosage Adjustments \n                  \n                  \n                  \n                     Patients with Severe Hepatic impairment \u00a0\n                  For amebiasis patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicate that the metronidazole capsules 375 mg dose should be reduced by 50%. Therefore, the dosage regimen of metronidazole capsules 375 mg in Child Pugh C patients with amebiasis is 375 mg q8h for 5 to 10 days (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS). \n                  \n                  For trichomoniasis patients with severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation indicate that the frequency of metronidazole administration should be reduced from every 12 hours to every 24 hours. Therefore, the dosage regiment of metronidazole capsules 375 mg in Child Pugh C patients with trichomoniasis is 375 mg q24h for 7 days (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS). \n                  \n                  \n                     Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis \n                  \n                  Hemodialysis removes significant amounts of metronidazole and its metabolites from systemic circulation. The clearance of metronidazole will depend on the type of dialysis membrane used, the duration of the dialysis session, and other factors. If the administration of metronidazole cannot be separated from a hemodialysis session, supplementation of metronidazole dosage following the hemodialysis session should be considered, depending on the patient\u2019s clinical situation (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).",
