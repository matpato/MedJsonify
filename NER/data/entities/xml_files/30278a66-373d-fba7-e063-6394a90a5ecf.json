Administration of minocycline also produced a large goiter with high radioiodine uptake in rats fed a relatively high iodine diet.\n\n \n                  Treatment of various animal species with this class of drugs has also resulted in the induction of thyroid hyperplasia in the following: in rats and dogs (minocycline), in chickens (chlortetracycline) and in rats and mice (oxytetracycline).
