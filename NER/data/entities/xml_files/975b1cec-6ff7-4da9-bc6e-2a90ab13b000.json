The burn wounds are then cleansed and debrided, and silver sulfadiazine cream 1% is applied under sterile conditions. The burn areas should be covered with silver sulfadiazine cream 1% at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately 1/16 inch. Whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to any areas from which it has been removed by patient activity. Administration may be accomplished in minimal time because dressings are not required. However, if individual patient requirements make dressings necessary, they may be used.\n                  Reapply immediately after hydrotherapy.\n                  Treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream 1% should be continued until satisfactory healing has occurred, or until the burn site is ready for grafting. The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except if a significant adverse reaction occurs.",
