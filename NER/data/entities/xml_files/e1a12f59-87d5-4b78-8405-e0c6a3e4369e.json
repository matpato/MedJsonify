    "contraindications_original": "When there is urgent need, therapy in the hospitalized patient may be initiated intramuscularly or as a rapid intravenous bolus injection directly into the vein. Hydralazine Hydrochloride Injection should be used only when the drug cannot be given orally. The usual dose is 20-40 mg, repeated as necessary.\n                  Certain patients (especially those with marked renal damage) may require a lower dose. Blood pressure should be checked frequently. It may begin to fall within a few minutes after injection, with the average maximal decrease occurring in 10-80 minutes. In cases where there has been increased intracranial pressure, lowering the blood pressure may increase cerebral ischemia. Most patients can be transferred to oral hydralazine hydrochloride within 24-48 hours.\n                  The product should be used immediately after the vial is opened. The product should not be added to infusion solutions. Hydralazine Hydrochloride Injection may discolor upon contact with metal; discolored solutions should be discarded.\n                  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.",
