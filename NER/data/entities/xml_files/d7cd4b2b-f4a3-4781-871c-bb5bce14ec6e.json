    "indications_original": "In Anesthesia\n                  \n                  Glycopyrrolate Injection, USP is indicated for use as a preoperative antimuscarinic to reduce salivary, tracheobronchial, and pharyngeal secretions; to reduce the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions; and to block cardiac vagal inhibitory reflexes during induction of anesthesia and intubation. When indicated, Glycopyrrolate Injection, USP may be used intraoperatively to counteract surgically or drug-induced or vagal reflexes associated arrhythmias. Glycopyrrolate protects against the peripheral muscarinic effects (e.g., bradycardia and excessive secretions) of cholinergic agents such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine given to reverse the neuromuscular blockade due to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.\n                  \n                     In Peptic Ulcer\n                  \n                  For use in adults as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of peptic ulcer when rapid anticholinergic effect is desired or when oral medication is not tolerated.",

It should be administered intravenously as single doses of 0.1 mg and repeated, as needed, at intervals of 2 to 3 minutes. The usual attempts should be made to determine the etiology of the arrhythmia, and the surgical or anesthetic manipulations necessary to correct parasympathetic imbalance should be performed.\n                  Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade\n                  The recommended dose of glycopyrrolate injection is 0.2 mg for each 1.0 mg of neostigmine or 5.0 mg of pyridostigmine. In order to minimize the appearance of cardiac side effects, the drugs may be administered simultaneously by intravenous injection and may be mixed in the same syringe.\n                  Peptic Ulcer\n                  The usual recommended dose of glycopyrrolate injection is 0.1 mg administered at 4-hour intervals, 3 or 4 times daily intravenously or intramuscularly. Where more profound effect is required, 0.2 mg may be given. Some patients may need only a single dose, and frequency of administration should be dictated by patient response up to a maximum of four times daily.\n                  Glycopyrrolate injection is not recommended for the treatment of peptic ulcer in pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).\n                  \n                     Pediatric Patients\n                  \n                  (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use)\n                  Preanesthetic Medication\n                  The recommended dose of glycopyrrolate injection in pediatric patients is 0.004 mg/kg intramuscularly, given 30 to 60 minutes prior to the anticipated time of induction of anesthesia or at the time the preanesthetic narcotic and/or sedative are administered.\n                  Infants\n                  (1 month to 2 years of age) may require up to 0.009 mg/kg.\n                  Intraoperative Medication\n                  Because of the long duration of action of glycopyrrolate injection if used as preanesthetic medication, additional glycopyrrolate injection for anticholinergic effect intraoperatively is rarely needed; in the event it is required the recommended pediatric dose is 0.004 mg/kg intravenously, not to exceed 0.1 mg in a single dose which may be repeated, as needed, at intervals of 2 to 3 minutes. The usual attempts should be made to determine the etiology of the arrhythmia, and the surgical or anesthetic manipulations necessary to correct parasympathetic imbalance should be performed.\n                  Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade\n                  The recommended pediatric dose of glycopyrrolate injection is 0.2 mg for each 1.0 mg of neostigmine or 5.0 mg of pyridostigmine.
