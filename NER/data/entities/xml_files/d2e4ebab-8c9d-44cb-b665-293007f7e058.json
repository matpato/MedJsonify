    "contraindications_original": "Dosage of Prednisolone Oral Solution, USP should be individualized according to the severity\u00a0of the disease and the response of the patient. For infants and children, the recommended\u00a0dosage should be governed by the same considerations rather than strict adherence to the\u00a0ratio indicated by age or body weight.\n                  Hormone therapy is an adjunct to and not a replacement for conventional therapy.\n                  Dosage should be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered\u00a0for more than a few days.\n                  The severity, prognosis, expected duration of the disease, and the reaction of the patient to\u00a0medication are primary factors in determining dosage.\n                  If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be\u00a0discontinued.\u00a0\n                  Blood pressure, body weight, routine laboratory studies, including two-hour postprandial blood\u00a0glucose and serum potassium, and a chest X-ray should be obtained at regular intervals during\u00a0prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with known or suspected pepticulcer disease.\n                  The initial dosage of Prednisolone Oral Solution, USP may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg per day\u00a0depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower\u00a0doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If\u00a0after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, Prednisolone\u00a0Oral Solution, USP should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST\u00a0BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE\u00a0OF THE PATIENT.\n                  After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined\u00a0by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until\u00a0the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should\u00a0be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in\u00a0the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status\u00a0secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug\u00a0responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related\u00a0to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase\u00a0the dosage of Prednisolone Oral Solution, USP for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s\u00a0condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be\u00a0withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.",
