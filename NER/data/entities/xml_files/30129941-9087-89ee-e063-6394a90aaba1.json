    "contraindications_original": "In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally may occur following the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets. The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before beginning therapy with enalapril maleate tablets to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (see \n         \n \n  WARNINGS, Hypotension). If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with Enalapril Maleate Tablets alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed. \n         \n \n  \n                           If the diuretic cannot be discontinued an initial dose of 2.5 mg should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see \n         \n \n  WARNINGS, Hypotension\u00a0and \n         \n \n  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).\n                           \n                           The recommended initial dose in patients not on diuretics is 5 mg once a day. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. The usual dosage range is 10 to 40 mg per day administered in a single dose or two divided doses. In some patients treated once daily, the antihypertensive effect may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval. In such patients, an increase in dosage or twice daily administration should be considered. If blood pressure is not controlled with enalapril maleate tablets alone, a diuretic may be added.\n         \n \n  \n                           Concomitant administration of enalapril maleate tablets with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes, or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (see \n         \n \n  PRECAUTIONS).\n                           \n                           \n                              Dosage Adjustment in Hypertensive Patients with Renal Impairment\n         \n \n  \n                           \n                           The usual dose of enalapril is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance more than 30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg/dL). For patients with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min (serum creatinine more than or equal to 3 mg/dL), the first dose is 2.5 mg once daily.
