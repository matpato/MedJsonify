    "indications_original": "Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is indicated for the prevention and control of seizures in preeclampsia and eclampsia, respectively. When used judiciously it effectively prevents and controls the convulsions of eclampsia without producing deleterious depression of the central nervous system of the mother or infant. However, other effective drugs are available for this purpose.",
    "contraindications_original": "Magnesium sulfate in water for injection is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities.\n                  \n                     In Eclampsia \n                  \n                  In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 g to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of Magnesium sulfate in water for injection may be administered intravenously. The rate of \u00a0intravenous infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 3.75 mL of a 4% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 g to 5 g (32.5 mEq to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% Magnesium Sulfate Injection, USP. After the initial\u00a0 intravenous dose, some clinicians administer 1 g/hour to 2 g/hour by constant\u00a0 intravenous infusion. \n                  Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 g to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. \n                  A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 g to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained and the maximum dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. \n                  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. \n                   Do not administer unless solution is clear.
