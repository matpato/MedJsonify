( 2.1 ) Strongly consider prescribing naloxone at the time buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is initiated or renewed because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose. ( 2.2 ) To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be administered in divided doses when used as initial treatment. ( 2.3 ) For patients dependent on short-acting opioid products who are in opioid withdrawal; on Day 1, administer up to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film (in divided doses). On Day 2, administer up to 16 mg/4 mg of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film as a single dose. ( 2.3 ) For patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products, induction onto sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended on Days 1 and 2 of treatment. ( 2.3 ) For maintenance treatment, the target dosage of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is usually 16 mg/4 mg as a single daily dose. ( 2.4 ) Sublingual Administration: Place one film under the tongue, close to the base on the left or right side, and allow to completely dissolve. Buccal Administration: Place one film on the inside of the left or right cheek and allow to completely dissolve. ( 2.5 ) Buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film must be administered whole. Do not cut, chew, or swallow buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film. ( 2.5 ) When discontinuing treatment, gradually taper to avoid signs and symptoms of withdrawal. ( 2.8 )",
