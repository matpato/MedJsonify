    "contraindications_original": "Buprenorphine HCl should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.\n                     Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patients treatment goals [see WARNINGS]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Buprenorphine HCl for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.\n                     Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.\n                     There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient\u2019s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see WARNINGS].\n                     Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Buprenorphine HCl. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see WARNINGS].\n                     Inspect Buprenorphine HCl for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.",
