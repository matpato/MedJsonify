    "indications_original": "Ethacrynic acid tablets are indicated for treatment of edema when an agent with greater diuretic potential than those commonly employed is required.\n                  \n                     Treatment of the edema associated with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including the nephrotic syndrome.\n                     Short-term management of ascites due to malignancy, idiopathic edema, and lymphedema.\n                     Short-term management of hospitalized pediatric patients, other than infants, with congenital heart disease or the nephrotic syndrome.\n                  \n                  Intravenous ethacrynate sodium is indicated when a rapid onset of diuresis is desired, e.g., in acute pulmonary edema, or when gastrointestinal absorption is impaired or oral medication is not practicable.",
    "contraindications_original": "Dosage must be regulated carefully to prevent a more rapid or substantial loss of fluid or electrolyte than is indicated or necessary.The magnitude of diuresis and natriuresis is largely dependent on the degree of fluid accumulation present in the patient. Similarly, the extent of potassium excretion is determined in large measure by the presence and magnitude of aldosteronism.",
    "warningsAndPrecautions_original": "Ethacrynic acid tablets, USP, 25 mg, are white, capsule shaped tablets, scored and debossed \"USL\" and \"690\" on one side and blank on the other side.

    "adverseReactions_original": "All diuretics, including ethacrynic acid, are contraindicated in anuria. If increasing electrolyte imbalance, azotemia, and/or oliguria occur during treatment of severe, progressive renal disease, the diuretic should be discontinued.\n                  In a few patients this diuretic has produced severe, watery diarrhea. If this occurs, it should be discontinued and not used again.\n                  Until further experience in infants is accumulated, therapy with oral and parenteral ethacrynic acid is contraindicated.\n                  Hypersensitivity to any component of this product."
