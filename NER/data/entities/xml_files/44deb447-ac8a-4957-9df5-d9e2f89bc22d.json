Dosage, rate, and duration of administration are to be individualized and depend upon the indication for use, the patient\u2019s age, weight, clinical condition, concomitant treatment, and on the patient\u2019s clinical and laboratory response to treatment.\n                  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Use of a final filter is recommended during administration of all parenteral solutions, where possible.\n                  Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact. \n                  All injections in VIAFLEX plastic containers are intended for intravenous administration using sterile and nonpyrogenic equipment. \n                  Additives may be incompatible. Complete information is not available. Those additives known to be incompatible should not be used. Consult with pharmacist, if available. If, in the informed judgment of the physician, it is deemed advisable to introduce additives, use aseptic technique. Mix thoroughly when additives have been introduced. Do not store solutions containing additives.\n                  After opening the container, the contents should be used immediately and should not be stored for a subsequent infusion. Do not reconnect any partially used containers. Discard any unused portion.",
