Protect from freezing. Avoid excessive heat. Definition of \"Controlled Room Temperature\": \n                      \"A temperature maintained thermostatically that encompasses the usual and customary working environment of 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F); that results in a mean kinetic temperature calculated to be not more than 25\u00b0C; and that allows for excursions between 15\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C (59\u00b0 and 86\u00b0F) that are experienced in pharmacies, hospitals, and warehouses. Provided the mean kinetic temperature remains in the allowed range, transient spikes up to 40\u00b0C are permitted as long as they do not exceed 24 hours ... The mean kinetic temperature is a calculated value that may be used as an isothermal storage temperature that simulates the non isothermal effects of storage temperature variations.\" \n                      Reference: United States Pharmacopeia, General Notices.

There is no direct therapeutic effect to be expected from the formulation. The solution should never be infused directly into a patient.\n                  InterSol platelets are leukocyte-reduced apheresis platelet concentrates that are stored in a mix of 65% InterSol and 35% plasma, nominal. InterSol platelets prepared within the ranges described in the apheresis system\u00a0Operator's Manuals may be stored for up to 5 days at 20-24\u00b0C, with continuous agitation.",
