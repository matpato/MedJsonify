    "contraindications_original": "Table 1 (Recommended Dosages) summarizes the recommended volumes and concentrations of Lidocaine Hydrochloride\u00a0Injection, USP for various types of anesthetic procedures. The\u00a0dosages suggested in this table are for normal healthy adults\u00a0and refer to the use of epinephrine-fee solutions. When larger\u00a0volumes are required, only solutions containing epinephrine\u00a0should be used except in those cases where vasopressor drugs \n    may be contraindicated.\n \n                  There have been adverse event reports of chandrolysis in patients receiving intra-articular infusions of local anesthetics\u00a0following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures. Lidocaine\u00a0Hydrochloride Injection, USP is not approved for this use (see\u00a0\n \n  \n                        WARNINGS\u00a0\n                     and\n \n  \n                        DOSAGE\u00a0AND ADMINISTRATION\n                     ).\n\n \n                  These recommended doses serve only as a guide to the amount of anesthetic required for most routine procedures. The actual\u00a0volumes and concentrations to be used depend on a number of\u00a0factors such as type and extent of surgical procedure, depth of\u00a0anesthesia and degree of muscular relaxation required, duration\u00a0of anesthesia required,and the physical condition of the patient.\u00a0In all cases the lowest concentration and smallest dose that will\u00a0produce the desired result should be given. Dosages should be\u00a0reduced for children and for the elderly and debilitated patients\u00a0and patients with cardiac and/or liver disease.\n                  The onset of anesthesia, the duration of anesthesia and the\u00a0degree of muscular relaxation are proportional to the volume\u00a0and concentration (i.e., total dose) of local anesthetic used. Thus,\u00a0an increase in volume and concentration of Lidocaine\u00a0Hydrochloride Injection, USP will decrease the onset of\u00a0anesthesia, prolong the duration of anesthesia, provide a\u00a0greater degree of muscular relaxation and increase the\u00a0segmental spread of anesthesia. However, increasing the\u00a0volume and concentration of Lidocaine Hydrochloride\u00a0Injection, USP may result in a more profound fall in blood\u00a0pressure when used in epidural anesthesia. Although the\u00a0incidence of side effects with lidocaine HCL is quite low, caution\u00a0should be exercised when employing large volumes and\u00a0concentrations, since the incidence of side effects is directly\u00a0proportional to the total dose of local anesthetic agent injected.\u00a0For intravenous regional anesthesia, only the 50mL single dose\u00a0vial containing Lidocaine HCL 0.5% Injection should be used.\n                  \n                     Epidural Anesthesia\n                       For epidural anesthesia, only the following dosage forms of Lidocaine HCL Injection USP are recommended.\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                        \n                           \u00a01% without epinephrine\n                           \u00a010 mL Plastic Ampule\u00a0\n                        \n                        \n                           \u00a01% without epinephrine\n                           \u00a030 ml single dose solutions\n                        \n                        \n                           \u00a01% with epinephrine \n       \u00a01:200,000\n    \n                           \u00a030 ml single dose solutions\n                        \n                        \n                           \u00a01.5% without epinephrine\n                           \u00a010 mL Plastic Ampule\n                        \n                        \n                           \u00a01.5% without epinephrine\n                           \u00a020 mL Plastic Ampule\n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              \u00a01.5% without epinephrine\n                              \u00a01:200,000\n                           \n                           \n                              \u00a030 ml ampules,\n                              \u00a030 ml single dose solutions\n                           \n                        \n                        \n                           \u00a02% without epinephrine\n                           \u00a010 mL Plastic Ampule\n                        \n                        \n                           \n                              \u00a02% without epinephrine\n                              \u00a01:200,000\n                           \n                           \u00a020 ml ampules,\n    \n     \u00a020 ml single dose solutions\n                           \n                        \n                     \n                  \n                  Although these solutions are intended specifically for epidural\u00a0anesthesia, they may also be used for infiltration and peripheral nerve block, provided they are employed as single dose units.\u00a0These solutions contain no bacteriostatic agent.\n                  In epidural anesthesia, the dosage varies with the number of\u00a0dermatomes to be anesthetized (generally 2 to 3ml of the\u00a0indicated concentration per dermatome).\n                  \n                     Caudal and Lumbar Epidural Block\n                       As a precaution against the adverse experience sometimes\u00a0observed following unintentional penetration of the\u00a0subarachnoid space, a test dose such as 3 to 4.5 ml of 1.0%\u00a0lidocaine HCL should be administered at least 5 minutes prior to\u00a0injecting the total volume required for a lumbar or caudal\u00a0epidural block. The test dose should be repeated if the patient is\u00a0moved in a manner that may have displaced the catheter.\u00a0Epinephrine, if contained in the test dose (10 to 15 mcg have\u00a0been suggested), may serve as a warning of unintentional\u00a0intravascular injection. If injected into a blood vessel, this\u00a0amount of epinephrine is likely to produce a transient\u00a0\"epinephrine response\" within 45 seconds, consisting of an\u00a0increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure, circumoral\u00a0pallor, palpitations and nervousness in the unsedated patient.\u00a0The sedated patient may exhibit only a pulse rate increase of 20\u00a0or more beats per minute for 15 or more seconds. Patients on\u00a0beta blockers may not manifest changes in heart rate, but blood\u00a0pressure monitoring can detect an evanescent rise in systolic\u00a0blood pressure. Adequate time should be allowed for onset of \n    anesthesia after administration of each test dose. The rapid\u00a0injection of a large volume af Lidocaine Hydrochloride Injection,\u00a0USP through the catheter should be avoided, and, when feasible, fractional doses should be administered.\n\n \n                  In the event of the known injection of a large volume of local\u00a0anesthetic solution into the subarachnoid space, after suitable\u00a0resuscitation and if the catheter is in place, consider attempting\u00a0the recovery of drug by draining a moderate amount of\u00a0cerebrospinal fluid (such as 10 ml) through the epidural\u00a0catheter.",
