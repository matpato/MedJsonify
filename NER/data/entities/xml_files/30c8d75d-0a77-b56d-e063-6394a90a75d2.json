    "indications_original": "To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ampicillin capsules, ampicillin for oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin capsules and ampicillin for oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting of modifying antimicrobial therapy, in the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n                  Ampicillin capsules and ampicillin for oral suspension are indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms listed below:\n                  \n                     Infections of the genitourinary tract including gonorrhea:\n                     E. coli, P. mirabilis, enterococci,\n \n  Shigella, S. typhosaand other\n \n  Salmonella, and nonpenicillinase producing\n \n  N. gonorrhoeae.\n\n \n                  \n                     Infections of the respiratory tract:Nonpenicillinase- producing\n \n  H. influenzaeand\n \n  staphylococci,and\n \n  streptococciincluding\n \n  streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\n \n                  \n                     Infections of the gastrointestinal tract:\n                     Shigella, S. typhosaand other\n \n  Salmonella, E. coli, P. mirabilis,and\n \n  enterococci.\n\n \n                  \n                     Meningitis:\n                     N. Meningitides.\n\n \n                  Bacteriology studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to ampicillin should be performed. Therapy may be instituted prior to the results of susceptibility testing.",
    "contraindications_original": "Adults and children weighing over 20 kg:\n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections other than gonorrhea in men and women,the usual dose is 500 mg qid in equally spaced doses; severe or chronic infections may require larger doses. For the treatment of gonorrhea in both men and women, a single oral dose of 3.5 grams of ampicillin administered simultaneously with 1 gram of probenecid is recommended. Physicians are cautioned to use no less than the above recommended dosage for the treatment of gonorrhea. Follow-up cultures should be obtained from the original site(s) of infection 7 to 14 days after therapy. In women, it is also desirable to obtain culture test-of-cure from both the endocervical and anal canals. Prolonged intensive therapy is needed for complications such as prostatitis and epididymitis.\n\n \n                  For\n \n  respiratory tract infections, the usual dose is 250 mg qid in equally spaced doses.\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                        Pediatric patients weighing 20 kg or less:\n                     \n                  \n                  \n                     For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections, the usual dose is 100 mg/kg/day total, qid in equally divided and spaced doses. For\n \n  respiratory tract infections,the usual dose is 50 mg/kg/day total, in equally divided and spaced doses three to four times daily. Doses for children should not exceed doses recommended for adults.\n\n \n                  \n                     \n                        All Patients, Irrespective of Age and Weight:\n \n  \n                  \n                  Larger doses may be required for severe or chronic infections. Although ampicillin is resistant to degradation by gastric acid, it should be administered at least one-half hour before or two hours after meals for maximal absorption. Except for the single dose regimen for gonorrhea referred to above, therapy should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours after the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. In infections caused by hemolytic strains of streptococci, a minimum of 10 days\u2019 treatment is recommended to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis (see\n \n  \n                        PRECAUTIONS\u2013Laboratory Tests\n                     ). In the treatment of chronic urinary or gastrointestinal infections, frequent bacteriologic and clinical appraisal is necessary during therapy and may be necessary for several months afterwards. Stubborn infections may require treatment for several weeks. Smaller doses than those indicated above should not be used.",
