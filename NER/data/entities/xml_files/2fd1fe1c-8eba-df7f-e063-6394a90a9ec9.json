( 2.1 ) Strongly consider prescribing naloxone at the time buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film is initiated or renewed because patients being treated for opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse, putting them at risk for opioid overdose. ( 2.2 ) To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident and buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film should be administered in divided doses when used as initial treatment. ( 2.3 ) For patients dependent on short-acting opioid products who are in opioid withdrawal; on Day 1, administer up to 8 mg/2 mg buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film (in divided doses). On Day 2, administer up to 16 mg/4 mg of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film as a single dose. ( 2.3 ) For patients dependent on methadone or long-acting opioid products, induction onto sublingual buprenorphine monotherapy is recommended on Days 1 and 2 of treatment.
