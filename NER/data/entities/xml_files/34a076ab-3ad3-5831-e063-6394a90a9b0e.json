Continually reevaluate patients receiving Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see WARNINGS]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.\n                  If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets dosage. If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.\n                  Discontinuation of Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets\n                  When a patient who has been taking Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets, use a gradual downward titration of the dosage to prevent signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Do not stop Oxycodone and Acetaminophen Tablets abruptly [see WARNINGS, DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE].",
