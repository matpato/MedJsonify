    "indications_original": "For the management of schizophrenia.\n                  Trifluoperazine hydrochloride tablets, USP are effective for the short-term treatment of generalized non-psychotic anxiety. However, trifluoperazine hydrochloride tablets are not the first drug to be used in therapy for most patients with non-psychotic anxiety because certain risks associated with its use are not shared by common alternative treatments (i.e., benzodiazepines).\n                  When used in the treatment of non-psychotic anxiety, trifluoperazine hydrochloride tablets should not be administered at doses of more than 6 mg per day or for longer than 12 weeks because the use of trifluoperazine hydrochloride tablets at higher doses or for longer intervals may cause persistent tardive dyskinesia that may prove irreversible (see\n \n  WARNINGS).\n\n \n                  The effectiveness of trifluoperazine hydrochloride tablets as a treatment for non-psychotic anxiety was established in a 4-week clinical multicenter study of outpatients with generalized anxiety disorder (DSM-III). This evidence does not predict that trifluoperazine hydrochloride tablets will be useful in patients with other non-psychotic conditions in which anxiety, or signs that mimic anxiety, are found (i.e., physical illness, organic mental conditions, agitated depression, character pathologies, etc.).\n                  Trifluoperazine hydrochloride tablets have not been shown effective in the management of behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation.",
    "contraindications_original": "Dosage should be adjusted to the needs of the individual. The lowest effective dosage should always be used. Dosage should be increased more gradually in debilitated or emaciated patients. When maximum response is achieved, dosage may be reduced gradually to a maintenance level. Because of the inherent long action of the drug, patients may be controlled on convenient b.i.d. administration; some patients may be maintained on once a day administration.\n                  When trifluoperazine hydrochloride is administered by intramuscular injection, equivalent oral dosage may be substituted once symptoms have been controlled.\n                  Note: Although there is little likelihood of contact dermatitis due to the drug, persons with known sensitivity to phenothiazine drugs should avoid direct contact.",
