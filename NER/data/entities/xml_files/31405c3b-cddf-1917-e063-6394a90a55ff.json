    "indications_original": "Baclofen tablets, USP are useful for the alleviation of signs and symptoms of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis, particularly for the relief of flexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus, and muscular rigidity.\n                  Patients should have reversible spasticity so that baclofen treatment will aid in restoring residual function. Baclofen tablets, USP may also be of some value in patients with spinal cord injuries and other spinal cord diseases.\n                  Baclofen tablets, USP are not indicated in the treatment of skeletal muscle spasm resulting from rheumatic disorders. The efficacy of baclofen in stroke, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson's disease has not been established and, therefore, it is not recommended for these conditions.",

Start therapy at a low dosage and increase gradually until optimum effect is achieved (usually between 40-80 mg daily).\n                  The following dosage titration schedule is suggested: \n    10 mg t.i.d. for 3 days \n    Thereafter additional increases may be necessary but the total daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 80 mg daily (20 mg q.i.d.). \n    The lowest dose compatible with an optimal response is recommended. If benefits are not evident after a reasonable trial period, patients should be slowly withdrawn from the drug (See\n \n  WARNINGS, Abrupt Drug Withdrawal).",
