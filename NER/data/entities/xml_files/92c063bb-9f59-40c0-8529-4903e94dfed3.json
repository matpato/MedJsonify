    "indications_original": "To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of erythromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, erythromycin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n                  Erythromycin tablets are indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the diseases listed below:\n                  Upper respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate degree caused by\u00a0Streptococcus pyogenes;\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae;\u00a0Haemophilus influenzae\u00a0(when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of\u00a0H. influenzae\u00a0are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved) (see appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information).\n                  Lower respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by\u00a0Streptococcus pyogenes\u00a0or\u00a0Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n                  Listeriosis caused by\u00a0Listeria monocytogenes.\n                  Respiratory tract infections due to\u00a0Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n                  Skin and skin structure infections of mild to moderate severity caused by\u00a0Streptococcus pyogenes\u00a0or\u00a0Staphylococcus aureus\u00a0(resistant staphylococci may emerge during treatment).\n                  Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by\u00a0Bordetella pertussis. Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed susceptible individuals.\n                  Diphtheria: Infections due to\u00a0Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent establishment of carriers and to eradicate the organism in carriers.\n                  Erythrasma: In the treatment of infections due to\u00a0Corynebacterium minutissimum.\n                  Intestinal amebiasis caused by\u00a0Entamoeba histolytica\u00a0(oral erythromycins only). Extraenteric amebiasis requires treatment with other agents.\n                  Acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by\u00a0Neisseria gonorrhoeae: ErythrocinTM\u00a0Lactobionate-I.V. (erythromycin lactobionate for injection, USP) followed by erythromycin base orally, as an alternative drug in treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by\u00a0N. gonorrhoeae\u00a0in female patients with a history of sensitivity to penicillin. Patients should have a serologic test for syphilis before receiving erythromycin as treatment of gonorrhea and a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months.\n                  Erythromycins are indicated for treatment of the following infections caused by\u00a0Chlamydia trachomatis: conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections during pregnancy. When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults due to\u00a0Chlamydia trachomatis.3\n                  \n                  When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis caused by\u00a0Ureaplasma urealyticum.3\n                  \n                  Primary syphilis caused by\u00a0Treponema pallidum. Erythromycin (oral forms only) is an alternative choice of treatment for primary syphilis in patients allergic to the penicillins. In treatment of primary syphilis, spinal fluid should be examined before treatment and as part of the follow-up after therapy.\n                  Legionnaires\u2019 Disease caused by\u00a0Legionella pneumophila. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted,\u00a0in vitro\u00a0and limited preliminary clinical data suggest that erythromycin may be effective in treating Legionnaires\u2019 Disease.",
    "contraindications_original": "In most patients, erythromycin tablets are well absorbed and may be dosed orally without regard to meals. However, optimal blood levels are obtained when erythromycin tablets are given in the fasting state (at least 1/2 hour and preferably 2 hours before meals).\n                  \n                     Adults\n                  \n                  The usual dosage of erythromycin tablets is one 250 mg tablet four times daily in equally spaced doses or one 500 mg tablet every 12 hours. Dosage may be increased up to 4 g per day according to the severity of the infection. However, twice-a-day dosing is not recommended when doses larger than 1 g daily are administered.\n                  \n                     Children\n                  \n                  Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. The usual dosage is 30 to 50 mg/kg/day, in equally divided doses.
