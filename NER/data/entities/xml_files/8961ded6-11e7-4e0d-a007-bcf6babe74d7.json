Response is usually noted within 12 to 24 hours and dosage may be reduced after two to four days and gradually discontinued over a period of five to seven days. For palliative management of patients with recurrent or inoperable brain tumors, maintenance therapy with either dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection or dexamethasone tablets in a dosage of 2 mg two or three times daily may be effective.\n                  Dexamethasone Suppression Tests\n                  \n                     \n                        1.Tests for Cushing\u2019s syndrome     Give 1 mg of dexamethasone orally at 11:00 p.m. Blood is drawn for plasma cortisol determination at 8:00 a.m. the following morning.For greater accuracy, give 0.5 mg of dexamethasone orally every 6 hours for 48 hours.
