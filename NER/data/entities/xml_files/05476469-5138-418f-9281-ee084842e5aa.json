    "indications_original": "Levocarnitine is indicated in the treatment of primary systemic carnitine deficiency. In the reported cases, the clinical presentation consisted of recurrent episodes of Reye-like encephalopathy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and/or cardiomyopathy. Associated symptoms included hypotonia, muscle weakness and failure to thrive. A diagnosis of primary carnitine deficiency requires that serum, red celland/or tissue carnitine levels be low and that the patient does not have a primary defect in fatty acid or organic acid oxidation (see  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). In some patients, particularly those presenting with cardiomyopathy, carnitine supplementation rapidly alleviated signs and symptoms. Treatment should include, in addition to carnitine, supportive and other therapy as indicated by the condition of the patient. \n                  \n                  Levocarnitine is also indicated for acute and chronic treatment of patients with an inborn error of metabolism which results in a secondary carnitine deficiency.",

Dosage should begin at 50 mg/kg/day. The exact dosage will depend on clinical response.\n                  \n                  Monitoring should include periodic blood chemistries, vital signs, plasma carnitine concentrations and overall clinical condition.\n                  \n                     \u00a0\n                  \n                  Levocarnitine Oral Solution and Levocarnitine Oral Solution (Sugar Free).\n                  \n                     For oral use only.

Higher doses should be administered only with caution and only where clinical and biochemical considerations make it seem likely that higher doses will be of benefit. Dosage should start at 50 mg/kg/day, and be increased slowly to a maximum of 3 g/day (30mL/day) while assessing tolerance and therapeutic response.
