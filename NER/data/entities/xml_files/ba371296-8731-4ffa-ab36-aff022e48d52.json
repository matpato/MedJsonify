    "indications_original": "Lanthanum carbonate is a phosphate binder indicated to reduce serum phosphate in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\n                      Management of elevated serum phosphorus levels in patients with ESRD usually includes all of the following: reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, removal of phosphate by dialysis, and reduction of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders.",
    "contraindications_original": "Divide the total daily dose of lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets and take with or immediately after meals. The recommended initial total daily dose of lanthanum\u00a0carbonate chewable tablets is 1,500 mg. Titrate the dose every 2 to 3 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphate level is reached. Monitor serum phosphate levels as needed during dose titration and on a regular basis thereafter.\n                  \n                  Lanthanum\u00a0has the potential to bind other orally administered drugs; consider separating the administration of other oral medications [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n                  \n                  In clinical studies of patients with ESRD, lanthanum\u00a0carbonate chewable tablets doses up to 4,500 mg were evaluated. Most patients required a total daily dose between 1,500 mg and 3,000 mg to reduce plasma phosphate levels to less than 6.0 mg/dL. Doses were generally titrated in increments of 750 mg/day.\n                  \n                     Information for lanthanum carbonate\u00a0Chewable Tablets \n                  \n                  Chew or crush lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets completely before swallowing. Do not swallow intact lanthanum carbonate chewable tablets.\n                  \n                  Consider using the oral powder formulation in patients with poor dentition or who have difficulty chewing tablets.",
